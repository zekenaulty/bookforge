The Lesser Green Slime didn’t just lunge; it performed a gravitational insult. 

It was a wobbling mass of translucent, neon-citrus phlegm that had spent the last thirty seconds cornering Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon against a jagged outcrop of rock. Now, it was mid-air, a "Tutorial Slam" in progress, and Artie’s entire life—all twenty-eight years of spreadsheets, lukewarm coffee, and that final, fatal argument with a vending machine—was about to be ended by a sentient puddle. The world around him, the Slime Fields, was a nauseating palette of oversaturated greens and purples, smelling faintly of sugar and ozone.

"Not like this," Artie wheezed, his lungs still feeling like they’d been scrubbed with steel wool from the electrocution that had sent him here. "I am not dying to a dessert topping."

He threw himself to the right. It wasn't a graceful roll. It was a panicked, flailing collapse that sent his slender frame face-first into the vibrant, glowing grass. The slime hit the rock behind him with a wet *thwack*, the sound of a giant steak being dropped onto a tile floor. The impact was so heavy it sent a tremor through the ground, vibrating up through Artie's pale chest where the severe electrical burns still throbbed with a phantom heat.

Artie scrambled to his feet, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird. The Corporate ID Badge clipped to his lanyard swung wildly, the plastic edge catching him in the chin with a sharp, annoying sting. He ignored it. He didn't have a sword. He didn't even have a sharpened pencil. He had two fists that had never hit anything harder than a 'Caps Lock' key. His mousy brown hair was matted with sweat and bits of neon grass, and his hazel eyes darted around the clearing, looking for an exit that wasn't blocked by undulating gelatin.

"Okay, Artie. Math. Focus on the math," he muttered, trying to steady his breathing. The creature was already re-inflating itself, its core—a dark, pea-sized nucleus—pulsing with a rhythmic, predatory light. "I have a hundred percent crit rate. That has to mean something, right? If I hit it, it breaks. It’s basic logic. It’s an if-then statement."

The slime jiggled. It looked like it was laughing, or perhaps just settling its internal mass for another strike.

Artie stepped forward, trying to channel every action movie he’d ever seen during his lunch breaks. He pulled his right fist back, his keyboard-calloused palm sweating, and launched a punch that he intended to be a jaw-shattering hook.

[Attack Initiated: Unarmed Strike]
[Accuracy Check: 12% (Poor Form)]

He swung so hard he actually spun. His fist whistled through the air, missing the slime’s core by a good six inches. The momentum carried him past the creature, and he nearly tripped over a protruding root.

[Miss #1: Over-extension]

"Calibration," Artie gasped, spinning back around and nearly losing his balance again. "Just a calibration swing. Establishing the parameters."

The slime bobbed, its surface shimmering under the artificial-looking sun of the tutorial zone. It seemed to be waiting for him, mocking his lack of coordination. Artie lunged again, this time with a straight jab. He kept his eyes open for approximately half a second before the sheer terror of the creature’s undulating, translucent surface made him flinch. His arm went limp, and he basically just waved at the monster.

[Miss #2: Flinch Reflex]

"Stop looking at me like that!" Artie yelled. The slime didn't have eyes, but he could feel the judgment radiating from its gelatinous bulk. It was the same look his manager used to give him when a pivot table collapsed. 

He tried a double-handed shove, hoping to at least knock the thing back and buy some space. He stepped into the neon-green slime trail the creature had left behind. His left foot went north, his right foot went nowhere, and he performed a frantic, mid-air dance that ended with him slapping the air where the slime had been a second ago.

[Miss #3: Environmental Slip]

The slime shifted, its core pulsing faster now. It was preparing another slam. Artie was running out of rock to hide behind and running out of dignity to lose. The weight of the Smartphone and Leather Wallet in his pockets felt like lead weights, dragging at his trousers as he struggled to regain his footing.

"Third time's the charm? No, that was three. Fourth! Fourth is... statistically significant!"

He charged. This wasn't a punch. This was a desperate, eyes-closed flail. He swung his left arm in a wide arc, his fist aimed at the center of the mass. The slime simply compressed itself, the top of its head dipping just low enough that Artie's knuckles scraped over the top of its sticky skin without actually registering a hit.

[Miss #4: Target Compression]

Artie was panting now, his slender frame reaching its limit. His Corporate ID Badge was tangled in his shirt, the lanyard choking him slightly. Every movement felt sluggish, like he was trying to fight through a vat of cold syrup. The system was watching, he knew. It was recording every failure, every pathetic gasp for air.

The slime launched. It was a low-altitude glide, aimed straight for his chest.

"Get! Away!" Artie screamed, throwing a frantic kick. 

He missed. Not just the slime, but the ground. He overcompensated for the creature's movement, his leg sailing through empty space, and he landed hard on his backside. The impact jarred his spine, sending a jolt of pain through his pale skin.

[Miss #5: Total Balance Failure]

The slime landed inches from his crotch, its surface vibrating with the intensity of a subwoofer. It was over. Artie was on the ground, 1 HP, and the tutorial monster was ready to deliver the final 'Tutorial Slam'. The air was thick with the scent of citrus-flavored doom.

"Screw you," Artie hissed at the floating text, his hazel eyes narrowing with a sudden, sharp spark of spite. 

The slime reared back, expanding to twice its size. It was a wall of green death, a wobbling executioner. Artie didn't have time to stand. He didn't have time to aim. He didn't have time to think about form or accuracy or the fact that he was about to die to a level one mob. He just reached out with his right hand—the one with the keyboard callus—and gave the slime a weak, pathetic shove, as if he were trying to move a slightly annoying person out of his way at the deli counter.

It was the most half-hearted attack in the history of the multiverse.

The moment Artie's palm touched the slime’s surface, the world didn't just stop; it stuttered. 

The neon-green grass turned into a smear of static. The air smelled suddenly of burnt silicon and high-voltage discharge. A sound like a thousand glass windows shattering at once erupted from the point of contact, a cacophony of breaking code and shattered physics.

A pillar of white, blinding light erupted from Artie's hand. It didn't just hit the slime; it erased it. The Lesser Green Slime didn't pop or splatter; it simply ceased to be, its data overwritten by a surge of pure mathematical fury. The light continued, a horizontal spear of radiance that tore through the Slime Fields with the force of a collapsing star. 

Twenty feet behind where the slime had been, a massive, ancient-looking oak tree stood. Or it had stood. The beam of the crit hit the trunk, and the tree didn't fall. It disintegrated. The wood turned to ash, then the ash turned to light, and then there was just a perfectly circular hole where a forest giant had been a second ago. The ground beneath the beam's path was scorched into a glass-like trench.

The shockwave knocked Artie backward, his head ringing with a high-pitched whine. He scrambled away from the smoking line of scorched earth that now cut through the tutorial zone, his eyes wide with terror and awe.

Artie stared at the crater. A single, charred leaf drifted down from the sky, landing on his nose. He brushed it off with a trembling hand, looking down at his palm. It was perfectly fine. No burns, no scratches. Just the same faint keyboard callus he’d had since college. But where the slime had been, there was now a smoking, blackened pit in the earth, and the smell of ozone was thick enough to taste.

"I... I think I broke the tutorial," Artie whispered, his voice cracking.

He sat there for a long time, the Corporate ID Badge finally coming to a rest against his chest. He was Level 2. He was alive. And he was officially the most dangerous thing in this world—mostly because he had no idea how to stop what he had just started. The Slime Fields were quiet now, the remaining slimes having retreated into the tall grass, seemingly aware that the rules of their world had just been violently rewritten.

[System Note: Please try to leave some of the environment for the other players. This is a shared space.]

Artie looked at the smoking hole in the tree and then back at his hand. The spreadsheet wizardry of his old life felt like a distant, dusty memory compared to the raw, glitchy power he now held. He wasn't just a player anymore; he was a walking error message.
