The humid, popcorn-scented air of the breakroom felt like a personal insult. Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stood before the Snack-o-Matic 3000, his reflection in the plexiglass revealing a man whose mousy brown hair had finally given up on the concept of structure. His hazel eyes, usually sharp enough to spot a decimal error in a ten-thousand-row spreadsheet, were currently glazed with the hollow hunger of a man who had skipped lunch to fix a server migration.

In his right hand, he held a Crumpled Dollar Bill. It was a pathetic scrap of legal tender, softened by time and laundry cycles into something resembling a used tissue. Artie smoothed the Crumpled Dollar Bill against the edge of the machine's cold metal chassis, trying to coax some dignity back into the George Washington's wrinkled face. 

"Come on, George," Artie whispered, his voice cracking. "Just one bag of Cool Ranch. That’s all I need to survive the 4:00 PM status meeting. Don't do this to me."

He fed the Crumpled Dollar Bill into the slot. The machine groaned, a mechanical sound of gears grinding against years of accumulated dust and spilled soda. The intake rollers grabbed the Crumpled Dollar Bill, pulled it halfway in, and then—with a shudder that felt suspiciously like a shrug—spat the Crumpled Dollar Bill back out.

Artie caught the Crumpled Dollar Bill before it hit the sticky linoleum floor. He looked at his Corporate ID Badge, which dangled from a frayed blue lanyard around his neck. The photo on the badge showed a younger, more optimistic version of himself, a Junior Data Analyst who still believed that hard work resulted in something other than lower-back pain and a 1.0 Luck stat.

"You're seeing this, right?" he asked the empty room. The only response was the rhythmic hum of a refrigerator that had been vibrating since the late nineties.

He tried again. This time, he used his thumb and forefinger to iron out the corners of the bill with the precision of a diamond cutter. He fed the Crumpled Dollar Bill in slowly. The machine swallowed it. The rollers whirred. A digital display, flickering with a dying orange glow, changed from zero to one dollar.

Artie breathed a sigh of relief. He hovered his finger over the keypad. B-4. The position of the last remaining bag of chips. The holy grail of the afternoon slump. He pressed the buttons with a flourish.

Inside the machine, the metal coil began to rotate. The bag of chips shifted forward. It tilted. It reached the precipice. And then, the coil stopped. The bag hung there, suspended by a single plastic corner, dangling over the drop zone like a climber clinging to a cliff face in a low-budget action movie.

The orange display blinked a jam error.

"No," Artie said, his voice dropping to a dangerous register. "No, no, no. You did not just do that."

He tapped the plexiglass. Nothing. He nudged the machine with his shoulder. The bag of chips didn't even quiver. 

Artie looked down at his slender frame. He wasn't a man of great physical power. His Strength was the kind of number that made gym teachers weep. But he had one thing: a lifetime of being screwed over by automated systems. He had a specific set of skills.

He gripped the edges of the Snack-o-Matic. He planted his feet on the linoleum, feeling the faint keyboard callus on his right palm burn against the metal. He began to shake.

This wasn't just a random tremor. This was a calculated, rhythmic assault. He pulled the machine forward and shoved it back, timing the oscillations to match the internal frequency of the snack coils. 

"Give. Me. My. Chips!" 

The machine rattled. Inside, the bag of chips began to dance. Artie felt a surge of adrenaline. He was winning. For once in his miserable, data-driven life, he was going to beat the system. He ignored the Smartphone vibrating in his left pocket—probably another urgent email about a broken pivot table. It didn't matter. The only metric that mattered was the distance between those chips and the bottom of the bin.

Suddenly, the machine emitted a sound it had never made before—a high-pitched, electronic whine that sounded like a choir of angels being fed through a blender. A spark jumped from the keypad to Artie’s Corporate ID Badge.

Artie didn't have time to wonder why a vending machine was suddenly outputting enough voltage to power a small suburb. He didn't have time to regret his career choices or the fact that his Leather Wallet, tucked safely in his right pocket, was currently the only thing between his thigh and a very hot piece of metal.

A blue arc of electricity erupted from the coin slot. It bypassed the plastic buttons and slammed directly into Artie’s chest, using the metal clip of his lanyard as a lightning rod.

The world didn't go black. It went neon. 

Artie felt his heart skip a beat, then decide it was done with the whole 'beating' thing entirely. A mental notification, sounding suspiciously like a system alert, screamed that a fatal error had been detected in his user profile. Reality itself seemed to flicker, the stability of his surroundings dropping to a precarious ninety-nine percent as the world pixelated at the edges. His muscles locked, his fingers fused to the metal frame of the machine.

The hum of the breakroom was replaced by a digital roar. Artie’s last thought wasn't of his family, or his unrequited love for the receptionist, or even the chips. 

It was: *I bet the machine keeps my dollar.*

Then, the surge peaked. Arthur Penhaligon, Junior Data Analyst and victim of a 1.0 Luck stat, collapsed to the floor. The bag of chips finally fell, landing softly on his chest. 

He was very, very dead.
