The golden haze from the vaporized lock hadn't even settled before the front window of Barnaby's Bargains & Blunders imploded. A hail of glass shards whistled through the air, narrowly missing Artie's head as he lunged toward the pedestal. Outside, the roar of the mob had shifted from a general riot to a focused, predatory chant.

[Aggro Meter: 99% (CRITICAL DENSITY)]

Artie didn't look back. He reached into the shimmering light and snatched the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion. The fabric felt like wet silk and looked like someone had bottled the essence of a thousand high-visibility safety vests. It wasn't just yellow; it was aggressively, offensively neon.

[System Notification: Item Equipped!]
[Cloak of the Cowardly Lion (Unique)]
[Type: Armor/Back]
[Stats: +50 Evasion]
[Passive: Coward’s Sprint - Movement speed increased by 20% when moving away from enemies.]
[Penalty: -100 Dignity (The world knows what you are.)]

"Fifty evasion?" Artie hissed, throwing the garment over his shoulders. He didn't have time to worry about his dignity; he had exactly one hit point and a shop full of people who suddenly wanted him dead. "I’ll take it."

The moment the cloak settled on his frame, a translucent blue box flickered in his peripheral vision.

[HP: 1/1]
[Evasion: 50]

A heavy-set townsperson, eyes glowing with the unnatural red light of the 'Marked for Death' status, vaulted over the shattered counter. He swung a meat cleaver in a wide, desperate arc. Artie didn't even have time to think about dodging. His body simply blurred. He felt a strange, greasy sensation as the air itself seemed to push him three inches to the left. The cleaver buried itself in the wood of the pedestal with a dull *thunk*.

[Evasion Proc! (50% Chance)]

"Sorry! Just passing through!" Artie shouted, his voice cracking. He pivoted, the neon yellow fabric of the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion snapping behind him like a flare in a dark cave. 

The Participation Trophy remained firmly fused to his left hand, its golden surface pulsing in time with the Aggro Meter. He felt like a walking lighthouse. Every monster, guard, and disgruntled shopper within a mile was currently recalculating their route to intersect with his face.

The back wall of the shop groaned as a stray spell from the street outside clipped the foundation. Dust rained down in thick sheets. Artie scrambled over a pile of ruined crates, his eyes locked on the small, unassuming service door at the rear of the building.

Another attacker—a low-level thief who had probably just been looking for a quick score—lunged from the shadows of the rafters. Artie’s new gear reacted again. He did a frantic, uncoordinated stumble-step that somehow resulted in the thief’s dagger passing through the empty space where Artie’s ribs had been a millisecond prior.

[Evasion Proc! (50% Chance)]

"I hate this game!" Artie yelled, kicking the back door open. 

He burst out into the narrow alleyway behind the shop. The 'Coward’s Sprint' kicked in immediately, his legs feeling light and twitchy as he bolted away from the collapsing structure. Behind him, the shop gave one final, agonizing creak before the roof caved in, momentarily burying the entrance and the mob that had been trying to squeeze through it.

Artie didn't stop to check the loot. He kept running, a streak of neon yellow blurring through the gray shadows of Oakhaven’s backstreets, his heart hammering against his single point of health.
