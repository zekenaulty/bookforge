The heavy oak doors of the Mayor’s office thudded shut behind Artie, but they couldn't muffle the persistent, rhythmic *thrum* vibrating through his left palm. The Participation Trophy was glowing with a sickly, neon-orange light that seemed to pulse in time with his own frantic heartbeat. It wasn't just an item; it was a homing beacon for every bad decision in a fifty-mile radius.

Artie stepped onto the cobblestones of Oakhaven’s Town Square, and the atmosphere shifted instantly. The bustling market, filled with NPCs hawking "Crit-Chance Potions" and players comparing the glow of their enchanted codpieces, went silent. A literal path cleared in front of him. It wasn't out of respect; it was the biological imperative of every living thing to move away from a ticking time bomb.

[Aggro Meter: 95% (Critical Warning: Monster Beacon Active)]

"Great," Artie muttered, his fingers tightening around the cold, gold-plated base of the Participation Trophy. "I’m not a hero; I’m a localized natural disaster."

He tried to keep his head down, mousy brown hair falling over his hazel eyes, but it was hard to be inconspicuous when you were a walking rave. He adjusted the Corporate ID Badge hanging from his neck—a useless piece of plastic from a world where the biggest threat was a passive-aggressive CC’d email—and started toward the western gate.

He didn't make it ten paces.

A shadow fell across the stones, long and jagged like a serrated blade. The air temperature seemed to drop ten degrees, smelling suddenly of ozone and expensive leather. Artie stopped. His 1 HP pulsed in his vision, a tiny, fragile red sliver that felt like it was made of spun glass.

"So," a voice drawled, dripping with the kind of confidence only attainable by someone who has never been told 'no' by a vending machine. "You’re the Anomaly."

Artie looked up. Standing in the center of the square was a man who looked like he had been designed by a committee of people who thought 'subtlety' was a type of sandwich. He was tall, athletic, and clad in obsidian plate armor so polished Artie could see his own terrified reflection in the breastplate.

[Vane - Lvl 45]
[Title: Top 100 Slayer]
[HP: 500/500]

The man shifted, and the massive weapon held in his right hand caught the sunlight. The Obsidian Greatsword was a monstrosity of volcanic glass and cruel geometry, the edge so sharp it looked like it was cutting the air itself just by existing.

"I prefer 'Arthur,' or 'Artie' if we’re being casual," Artie said, his voice cracking only slightly. "And you are... wearing a lot of black for a sunny day. Isn't that hot?"

Vane didn't laugh. He didn't even blink. His steely grey eyes scanned Artie with the clinical detachment of a butcher looking at a side of beef. 

"I watched the gate logs," Vane said, stepping forward. The crowd retreated further, forming a wide circle of spectators. "One health point. A statistical impossibility. And yet, the scanners say you hit like a god. Or a glitch."

"It’s a very specialized build," Artie lied, his mind racing. "High risk, high reward. Mostly risk. Actually, it’s about 99% risk. Can I go now? I have a... thing. A meeting about a cloak."

Vane raised the Obsidian Greatsword, the tip hovering inches from Artie’s chest. The sheer presence of the weapon caused a [Danger] notification to flicker at the edge of Artie’s UI.

"I don't like glitches," Vane said softly. "They mess with the rankings. They make the hard work of players like me look... inefficient. I think I’ll see what happens when that one point of health meets a Level 45 Execute."

[Aggro Meter: 96% (Warning: Target Locked)]

"Whoa, hey!" Artie held up his right hand, while his left continued to clutch the Participation Trophy like a shield. "Let's talk about this. I’m a Junior Analyst. I do spreadsheets. I don't even know how to hold a sword properly. You’d be killing a man who once spent forty minutes trying to find the 'any' key."

"Then you won't mind a test," Vane said. 

He moved. To Artie’s eyes, it wasn't a movement so much as a teleportation. The Obsidian Greatsword swung in a horizontal arc, a black blur aimed directly at Artie’s neck. 

Artie didn't think. He didn't have time to think. His body, fueled by the pure, unadulterated cowardice that had kept him alive through three corporate restructures, simply gave out. His knees buckled, and he tripped over a loose cobblestone.

The black blade whistled through the space where his head had been a microsecond before. The force of the swing was so great it sent a shockwave of air that ruffled Artie’s hair and nearly tore the Corporate ID Badge from his neck.

[Dodge! (Luck: 100%)]
[System Note: That was pathetic, but effective.]

Artie scrambled backward on his backside, the Participation Trophy clunking against the ground. "See? Terrible fighter! I’m basically a toddler in a dress shirt!"

Vane frowned, his jet black hair perfectly in place despite the exertion. He looked at his sword, then back at Artie. "You didn't parry. You didn't even try to block. You just... fell."

"It’s my signature move," Artie gasped, his heart hammering against his ribs. "I call it 'The Sudden Lack of Skeleton.' It’s very advanced."

Vane’s eyes narrowed. The curiosity in them was being replaced by a cold, sharp irritation. He gripped the hilt of the Obsidian Greatsword with both hands now. "No one dodges me by accident. Not with my Agility stat."

"Maybe your math is off?" Artie suggested, slowly finding his feet while keeping the trophy between them. "Have you tried carrying the one? I find that’s where most people stumble."

The crowd was whispering now. A Level 2 had just 'dodged' a Top 100 Slayer. The logic of the world was straining, and Artie could almost feel the reality stability dipping. He needed to leave. Now.

"I’m going to hit you again," Vane said, his voice flat. "And this time, I’m using a Skill."

[Vane is casting: Whirlwind of the Void]

"Oh, look! Is that a Legendary Loot Drop behind you?" Artie yelled, pointing frantically toward the fountain.

Vane didn't even turn. "Cheap. Predictable."

"No, seriously, it’s glowing!" 

Artie didn't wait to see if Vane believed him. He turned and bolted. He didn't run like a hero; he ran like a man who had seen a spider in his shower. He ducked under the arm of a startled merchant, dived through a display of 'Authentic Dragon Scales' (which were clearly painted plywood), and sprinted toward a narrow alleyway between the alchemist’s shop and a tavern.

"Get back here!" Vane’s roar echoed through the square.

Artie didn't look back. He squeezed into the alley, the Participation Trophy humming a frantic, high-pitched note that set his teeth on edge. He could hear the heavy clank of obsidian armor behind him, the sound of a predator who wasn't used to his prey having a head start.

He saw a stack of empty crates and, without slowing down, delivered a sharp kick to the base of the pile.

[Skill Triggered: Percussive Maintenance (Rank F)]
[Critical Hit!]

The crates didn't just fall; they exploded into a chaotic mess of splinters and heavy wood, perfectly blocking the narrow passage behind him. 

"I’m sorry!" Artie screamed over his shoulder. "I’ll pay for those! Send the invoice to the Mayor!"

He burst out the other side of the alley, found himself in a residential backstreet, and didn't stop running until the Aggro Meter in his vision finally started to tick downward. He was alive. He was at 1 HP. And he had just made an enemy of the most dangerous man in the city.

"Welcome to Oakhaven," Artie wheezed, leaning against a stone wall and clutching the glowing trophy to his chest. "Where the air is fresh and everyone wants to murder me for my math."
