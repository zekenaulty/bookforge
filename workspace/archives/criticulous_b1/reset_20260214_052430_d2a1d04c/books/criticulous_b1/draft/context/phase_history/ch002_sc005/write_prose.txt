The Cloak of the Cowardly Lion didn't just glow; it screamed. In the oppressive dampness of the Low-Level Crypts, the neon yellow fabric pulsed with the rhythmic intensity of a strobe light at a rave no one wanted to attend. It was a tactical disaster. It was a visual assault. It was currently the only thing keeping me from becoming a very thin smear on the floor.

A dry *clack-whirr* echoed from the shadows ahead.

"Yeah, thanks, I noticed," I whispered, my voice cracking. I shifted my grip on the Participation Trophy. The gold-plated plastic was cold in my left hand, its weight a constant reminder that I was legally and magically obligated to be here. 

From the darkness of a collapsed alcove, a Skeleton Archer stepped into the garish yellow light. It was a collection of yellowed ribs and spite, held together by graying sinew. It didn't have eyes, but the way it leveled its notched bow at my chest suggested it didn't need them.

"Twenty-two health," I muttered, my heart hammering against my ribs—a very fragile cage for a very fragile 1 HP life. "And he’s got the high ground. Sort of. It’s a slightly elevated pile of rubble."

The archer drew back the string. The sound was a precise, three-beat rhythm. *Creeee-ack. Snap.*

The arrow was a blur of dark wood. My brain screamed *run*, but my body had other plans. As the projectile neared, the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion flared. My legs didn't just move; they buckled in a very specific, cowardly fashion. I felt a phantom tug at my spine, a jerk of automated terror that sent me into a frantic, uncoordinated roll.

The arrow hissed through the space where my throat had been a microsecond ago, slamming into a stone pillar with a crack that made my teeth ache.

"Okay," I panted, scrambling to my feet. The neon glow of the cloak was reflecting off the stone, casting long, dancing shadows. "Okay. I can work with this. It’s just like the spreadsheet audits back at the firm. Data entry. Input, output, repeat."

The archer reached for another arrow. *Reach. Notch. Draw.*

"One, and two, and—"

I dived right. The second arrow skipped off the floor, sparks flying. I didn't wait for the cloak to trigger this time. I was already counting.

"Three, and four, and—"

I zig-zagged, my Corporate ID Badge bouncing against my chest. The archer was fast, but it was a script. A loop. And if there was one thing Arthur Penhaligon knew, it was how to find the error in a looping script. 

The third arrow caught the edge of the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion, passing through the neon fabric without touching skin. I felt the wind of it. My Aggro Meter spiked, the red bar vibrating so hard it looked like it might shatter.

[Stamina: 74/100]

"Is that all you've got?" I yelled, the adrenaline finally overriding the crushing weight of the 'Coward's Shame' debuff. "I've had vending machines with better aim than you!"

I wasn't just dodging anymore; I was timing it. I was sliding into the gaps between the frames of the world. Each arrow was a missed deadline, a corrupted cell in a column, and I was the delete key. 

The archer paused, its jawbone dropping as it reached for a quiver that was suddenly empty. It stood there, a Level 4 threat rendered impotent by a Level 2 glitch in a yellow raincoat. 

"My turn," I said, though I had no idea what 'my turn' actually looked like yet. I just knew I was still at 1 HP, and for the first time since I died, I wasn't just lucky. I was winning.
