The smoke rising from the vitrified dirt smelled like burnt sugar and ozone. Artie stood at the epicenter of a hundred-yard trench, a perfectly straight scar of blackened earth that had replaced a significant portion of the Whispering Woods. His finger hovered over a glowing blue icon vibrating in the air.

"He needed to put these into something before a squirrel breathed on him," Artie muttered. His heart was hammering against his ribs, a reminder that his lanky frame was currently held together by exactly one hit point. One. A stiff breeze was a boss mechanic.

"Ooh, look at you! Level two and already a domestic terrorist," Fizz chirped, her neon pink hair leaving trails of digital sparks as she zipped around his head. Fizz reached into her satchel and pulled out the heavy, leather-bound volume of The Noob's Guide to Not Dying. "The Guide says level two is when most players find their first pair of pants. You, however, seem to have found a way to violate the Geneva Convention."

"It was an accident, Fizz. The math glitched."

"The System doesn't call it a glitch, Artie. It calls it 'Optimization'."

[System Notification: Optimization Complete]

[Performance Review: S-Rank (Efficiency)]

"Redundant biological assets?" Artie looked at the smoldering remains of what used to be a very pretty grove of trees. "You mean the forest? And the slime?"

"And probably a few very confused dryads," Fizz added, flipping through The Noob's Guide to Not Dying. "But hey, the System appreciates the hustle. Look, it’s giving you a prize!"

A chime, bright and mocking, echoed through the clearing. A heavy, gold-painted Participation Trophy materialized directly into his right hand. 

[Reward Issued: Participation Trophy]

Artie looked down. The Participation Trophy was a gaudy, gold-plated statue of a slime with a confused expression, mounted on a faux-marble base. A small brass plaque on the front read: I Survived the Math.

"A participation trophy?" Artie lifted the heavy Participation Trophy. It felt like it weighed ten pounds. "I vaporized a hundred yards of reality and I get a 'You Tried' sticker?"

"Read the fine print, Artie. In this game, 'Participation' is a threat."

[Item: Participation Trophy (Cursed)]
[Type: Accessory / Monster Lure]
[Description: Awarded to entities whose presence is statistically negligible but physically disruptive. You’re not a hero, but you sure are loud.]
[Effect: 'The Center of Attention' - Increases monster aggro radius by 400%. All nearby entities are now aware of your exact coordinates and your lack of defensive stats.]

A low, guttural growl vibrated through the air, coming from the un-scorched edge of the woods. Then another. And a chittering sound that sounded like a thousand teeth grinding together.

"Fizz," Artie said, his voice dropping an octave. "What is that?"

"That would be the 'Center of Attention' effect kicking in," she said, her glowing violet eyes wide as she checked a new UI element appearing in his vision.

[Aggro Meter: 15% - Mildly Interesting]

"I need to spend these points. Now." Artie stabbed his finger at the 'Agility' button on the floating menu. If he couldn't have health, he needed speed. 

[Warning: Stat allocation interrupted by environmental threat.]

"What? No! Confirm! Confirm Agility!"

[Aggro Meter: 42% - Socially Significant]

"Artie, the Guide has a section on this!" Fizz shouted, hovering over his shoulder. "Chapter 4, Section 2: 'If you find yourself the target of an entire ecosystem, try to blend in.' Do you have any camouflage? Maybe you can pretend to be a very lanky, very terrified tree?"

"I am holding a glowing gold trophy that literally screams 'Kill Me' to everything with a pulse!" Artie yelled, swiping frantically at the menu. The 'Confirm' button kept sliding away every time the ground shook.

The bushes at the edge of the trench exploded. Three Level 4 Dire Wolves, their fur matted with burrs and their eyes glowing with a predatory red light, skidded onto the blackened earth. Behind them, a swarm of Level 3 Needle-Wasps began to pour out of the canopy like a funnel cloud of hate.

"Fizz, the book! Give me something useful!"

"Uh, let's see... 'If surrounded by apex predators, remember that you are also made of meat, which is a valuable resource'—no, that’s the Chef’s Guide—here! 'Chapter 12: Running is a valid tactical choice for those who enjoy living.'"

"Fourteen?" Artie looked behind the wolves. The shadows of the trees were moving. A lot of shadows.

Artie didn't wait for the wolves to charge. He tucked the Participation Trophy under his arm like a football and bolted down the center of the trench. It was the only clear path—a straight shot toward what he hoped was the exit of this nightmare tutorial zone.

"Run, Artie! The Guide says the wolves have a pounce range of six meters!" Fizz screamed, flying alongside him. "Also, you're breathing wrong! The Guide recommends rhythmic diaphragmatic breathing for optimal flight-from-death!"

"I'll breathe... when I'm... not... a snack!" Artie wheezed. 

Behind him, the howling intensified. The sound of paws thundering on the vitrified soil was getting louder. He risked a glance over his shoulder and saw the lead wolf's jaws snapping inches from where his heels had been a second ago.

"The exit!" Fizz pointed toward a break in the trees where the trench ended and a faint stone path began. "Just reach the path! Monsters usually respect regional boundaries for some reason!"

"I hope... they read... the same... manual!"

Artie pushed his legs harder, his lanky frame straining as the swarm of Needle-Wasps began to dive-bomb his head. He swung the Participation Trophy blindly behind me, the gold-plated slime clunking against something hard and chitinous.

[Critical Hit! -12 HP (Needle-Wasp)]
[Note: That was lucky. Don't do it again.]

"I'm trying!" Artie yelled, the exit of the Whispering Woods looming ahead of him as a tide of fur and stingers surged at his back.
