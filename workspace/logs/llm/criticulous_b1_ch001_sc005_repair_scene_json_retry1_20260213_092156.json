You can only regret it.]\n\n\"Wait, 'personally insulting'?\" Artie looked down at the Participation Trophy in his left hand. It featured a small, golden figure of a man tripping over a rock while holding a calculator. \"Fizz, what does 'Monster Beacon' actually do in numerical terms?\"\n\n\"In numerical terms?\" Fizz zipped around his head, her pixelated trail leaving a streak of blue light in the smoky air. \"It means your Aggro Meter is about to become a vertical line. Look up, Artie. Quickly.\"\n\nArtie looked. Above his 1/1 HP bar, a new UI element had appeared. It was a jagged red eye that was currently pulsing with an angry, rhythmic light.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 94% (Rising...)]\n\nA low, guttural growl echoed from the shadows of the remaining trees. Then another. And a third that sounded like a blender full of gravel. The \"lush forest\" suddenly felt a lot less like a tutorial zone and a lot more like a buffet where Artie was the only thing on the menu.\n\n\"The slime,\" Artie whispered, his heart hammering against his ribs. \"The explosion. Did it attract them?\"\n\n\"The explosion was the dinner bell,\" Fizz said, her voice rising an octave. \"The trophy is the GPS coordinates. Artie, you have exactly one hit point. If a squirrel sneezes on you, we both go back to the void, and I get demoted to 'Loading Screen Tip' status. Run!\"\n\n[System Warning: Local Aggro Threshold Exceeded!]\n[Status Inflicted: Marked for Death]\n[Description: Every monster in the 'Lush Forest' sub-zone is now sprinting toward your coordinates. Good luck, Anomaly.]\n\nArtie didn't wait for a second warning. He turned and bolted. His dress shirt, already rumpled and stained with office coffee and slime residue, billowed behind him. His Corporate ID Badge bounced painfully against his collarbone with every step.\n\n[Stamina: 92/100]\n\nThe forest, which had seemed peaceful ten minutes ago, was now a cacophony of snapping branches and predatory shrieks. To Artie's left, a pair of glowing red eyes burst through a thicket of ferns. He didn't stay to see what they belonged to. He just focused on the distant, shimmering outline of stone walls on the horizon\u2014Oakhaven.\n\n\"Is there a sprint button?\" Artie wheezed, his lungs burning. \"Because I really need a sprint button!\"\n\n\"You're already using it! It's called 'Adrenaline and Terror'!\" Fizz shouted, hovering effortlessly beside his ear. \"Left! Go left! There\u2019s a pack of Razor-Toothed Rabbits closing in from the right!\"\n\nArtie veered left, his boots skidding on a patch of moss. He nearly lost his balance, which would have been a death sentence.\n\n[Stamina: 75/100]\n\n[HP: 1/1]\n\nThe absurdity of it hit me even as Artie dodged a low-hanging branch. He was a Level 2 \"Statistical Anomaly\" with the power to vaporize gods, but he was currently being hunted by bunnies because he was holding a piece of plastic that made him smell like a target.\n\n\"Can I put the trophy in my pocket?\" Artie yelled over the sound of something large and heavy crashing through the underbrush behind them.\n\n\"It\u2019s a beacon, Artie! It doesn't matter if you put it in a lead box or up your\u2014\" Fizz cut herself off as a projectile\u2014a glob of hardened sap\u2014whistled past Artie's head, missing by an inch. \"Just run! The gates are only two kilometers away!\"\n\n\"Only two kilometers?\" Artie looked at his rapidly depleting stamina bar. \"I\u2019m an analyst! I haven't run two kilometers since the elevator in the office broke in 2019!\"\n\n[Stamina: 60/100]\n\nBehind him, the forest was alive with the sound of a hundred monsters converging on a single point.

He could see the gates now\u2014massive, iron-bound structures guarded by men in shining armor. They looked safe. They looked solid. They also looked a very, very long way away.\n\nArtie pushed his legs harder, the wind whipping past his ears as the first of the pursuers\u2014a lean, grey wolf with far too many teeth\u2014broke cover behind him. \n\n\"Don't look back!\" Fizz screamed.\n\nArtie didn't.

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nUI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says \"always include\".\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it unless explicitly removing a stale fact with REMOVE and restating the current truth.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v2\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\n\ufeffOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\":

        "content": "# REPAIR\n\nFix the scene based on lint issues.\nSummaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\nTimeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: pre-scene invariants and summary facts are binding unless the Scene Card depicts a change. If this scene changes a durable fact, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value and remove the old entry.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n- must_stay_true removal (mandatory when a durable fact is superseded):\n  - Add \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" in summary_update.must_stay_true.\n  - Place REMOVE lines before the new final invariant.\n  - REMOVE lines also apply to key_facts_ring (purge stale facts from continuity).\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- Inventory posture reconciliation:\n  - If inventory/containers change (held/stowed/container), must_stay_true must be updated to the final posture.\n  - Add REMOVE lines for prior inventory/container invariants before the new final entries.\n  - Use canonical invariant formats:\n    - inventory: CHAR_X -> <item display_name> (status=held|carried|equipped|stowed, container=hand_left|hand_right|<container>)\n    - container: <container> (owner=CHAR_X, contents=[<item display_name>, ...])\nFor held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\nContinuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.\n- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.\n- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.\n- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI gate: only include bracketed UI blocks when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If false, remove or rephrase UI blocks into narrative prose.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or a short parenthetical annotation (e.g., (locked), (Warning: ...)).\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nCanonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\nIf item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for authoritative labels and custody terms.\nUse item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If a durable appearance change occurs in this scene, record it in character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- APPEARANCE_CHECK is required in COMPLIANCE for each cast_present_id (4-8 tokens from atoms/marks).\n\nNaming repairs:\n- If lint flags an item naming issue, fix it with minimal edits.\n- Do not remove humor; simply anchor the item (add display_name near first mention) and ensure custody-change sentences include the display_name.\n- Do not rename item_id or registry fields; only adjust prose wording.\nsummary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\nSTATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nmust_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nIf state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nEnforce scene-card durable constraints: `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\nRespect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`.\n- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):\n  - If timeline_scope != \"present\" OR ontological_scope != \"real\", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).\n  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.\n  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category=\"timeline_override\".\nReturn corrected prose plus a corrected state_patch JSON block.\n\nOutput format (required, no code fences, no commentary):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n\nAPPEARANCE_CHECK:\n- CHAR_ID: <4-8 tokens from atoms/marks>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects.

Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n- Transfer vs registry conflict rule (must follow):\n  - If you create a NEW item in item_registry_updates with final custodian already set (e.g., CHAR_ARTIE), DO NOT emit transfer_updates for that item.\n  - If you emit transfer_updates for a NEW item, the registry entry must start with custodian=\"world\" and then transfer to the character.\n  - expected_before must match the registry entry at the moment of transfer (after any registry update that applies before it).  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects;

in front of my face. It didn't gently descend; it popped into existence with the obnoxious chime of a microwave finishing a bag of popcorn.\n\n\"Congratulations,\" Fizz said, her neon-blue form flickering with a static-heavy sigh. \"You\u2019ve successfully broken the tutorial's physics engine. I hope you\u2019re proud of yourself. The System had to pull from the 'Emergency Compensation' pool for this one.\"\n\nI reached out and grabbed the object floating in the air. It felt like cheap, gold-plated plastic.\n\n[Item Received: Participation Trophy (Cursed)]\n[Type: Cursed Accessory]\n[Rarity: Rare (Glitch-Tier)]\n[Description: Awarded to those who achieve a victory so statistically improbable that the System assumes you\u2019re cheating but can\u2019t prove it. It\u2019s ugly, it\u2019s heavy, and it smells like ozone and desperation.]\n[Passive Effect: Monster Beacon \u2013 Your presence is now broadcast on all frequencies. Monsters within 1km are aware of your location and find your face personally insulting.]\n[Note: This item is Soulbound. You can\u2019t drop it. You can\u2019t sell it. You can only regret it.]\n\n\"Wait, 'personally insulting'?\" I looked down at the trophy in my left hand. It featured a small, golden figure of a man tripping over a rock while holding a calculator. \"Fizz, what does 'Monster Beacon' actually do in numerical terms?\"\n\n\"In numerical terms?\" Fizz zipped around my head, her pixelated trail leaving a streak of blue light in the smoky air. \"It means your Aggro Meter is about to become a vertical line. Look up, Artie. Quickly.\"\n\nI looked. Above my 1/1 HP bar, a new UI element had appeared. It was a jagged red eye that was currently pulsing with an angry, rhythmic light.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 94% (Rising...)]\n\nA low, guttural growl echoed from the shadows of the remaining trees. Then another. And a third that sounded like a blender full of gravel. The \"lush forest\" suddenly felt a lot less like a tutorial zone and a lot more like a buffet where I was the only thing on the menu.\n\n\"The slime,\" I whispered, my heart hammering against my ribs. \"The explosion. Did it attract them?\"\n\n\"The explosion was the dinner bell,\" Fizz said, her voice rising an octave. \"The trophy is the GPS coordinates. Artie, you have exactly one hit point. If a squirrel sneezes on you, we both go back to the void, and I get demoted to 'Loading Screen Tip' status. Run!\"\n\n[System Warning: Local Aggro Threshold Exceeded!]\n[Status Inflicted: Marked for Death]\n[Description: Every monster in the 'Lush Forest' sub-zone is now sprinting toward your coordinates. Good luck, Anomaly.]\n\nI didn't wait for a second warning. I turned and bolted. My dress shirt, already rumpled and stained with office coffee and slime residue, billowed behind me. My Corporate ID Badge bounced painfully against my collarbone with every step.\n\n[Stamina: 92/100]\n\nThe forest, which had seemed peaceful ten minutes ago, was now a cacophony of snapping branches and predatory shrieks. To my left, a pair of glowing red eyes burst through a thicket of ferns. I didn't stay to see what they belonged to. I just focused on the distant, shimmering outline of stone walls on the horizon\u2014Oakhaven.\n\n\"Is there a sprint button?\" I wheezed, my lungs burning. \"Because I really need a sprint button!\"\n\n\"You're already using it! It's called 'Adrenaline and Terror'!\" Fizz shouted, hovering effortlessly beside my ear. \"Left! Go left! There\u2019s a pack of Razor-Toothed Rabbits closing in from the right!\"\n\nI veered left, my boots skidding on a patch of moss. I nearly lost my balance, which would have been a death sentence.\n\n[Stamina: 75/100]\n\n[HP: 1/1]\n\nThe absurdity of it hit me even as I dodged a low-hanging branch. I was a Level 2 \"Statistical Anomaly\" with the power to vaporize gods, but I was currently being hunted by bunnies because I was holding a piece of plastic that made me smell like a target.\n\n\"Can I put the trophy in my pocket?\" I yelled over the sound of something large and heavy crashing through the underbrush behind us.\n\n\"It\u2019s a beacon, Artie! It doesn't matter if you put it in a lead box or up your\u2014\" Fizz cut herself off as a projectile\u2014a glob of hardened sap\u2014whistled past my head, missing by an inch. \"Just run! The gates are only two kilometers away!\"\n\n\"Only two kilometers?\" I looked at my rapidly depleting stamina bar. \"I\u2019m an analyst! I haven't run two kilometers since the elevator in the office broke in 2019!\"\n\n[Stamina: 60/100]\n\nBehind me, the forest was alive with the sound of a hundred monsters converging on a single point. The Aggro Meter hit 100% and turned a dark, bruised purple. \n\n[New Quest: Run for Your Life!]\n[Objective: Reach the Oakhaven Gate Scanners.]\n[Reward: Not dying.]\n[Failure: Deletion.]\n\n\"I hate this game,\" I panted, my vision starting to tunnel. \"I really, really hate this game.\"\n\n\"Save your breath for the sprinting!\" Fizz urged.\n\nI gripped the Participation Trophy tighter, its golden surface mocking me in the dappled sunlight. I could see the gates now\u2014massive, iron-bound structures guarded by men in shining armor. They looked safe. They looked solid. They also looked a very, very long way away.\n\nI pushed my legs harder, the wind whipping past my ears as the first of the pursuers\u2014a lean, grey wolf with far too many teeth\u2014broke cover behind me. \n\n\"Don't look back!\" Fizz screamed.\n\nI didn't. I just ran.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"characters\": {\n
