      "message": "The authoritative MUST_STAY_TRUE invariants contradict the post-patch character state. The invariant 'Artie's HP is 0 and he is in a 'Deceased (Pending)' state' directly conflicts with the updated character state 'continuity_system.characters.CHAR_ARTIE.stats.hp.current: 1'. Additionally, the character_states.invariants list claims items (crumpled dollar bill, etc.) are 'carried' while the character_states.inventory field is empty and MUST_STAY_TRUE correctly marks them as 'lost'.",
