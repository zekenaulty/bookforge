# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
Prose hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative ("left hand", "right hand", "Artie", "his wallet").
Item naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.
Appearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Continuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.
Continuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.
Durable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.
JSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.
Inventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

﻿Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.
Durable vs ephemeral mechanics:
- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.
- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.
- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).
- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.
For durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
For durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).
Use canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.
- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.
  - INVALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": {"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}
  - VALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": [{"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}]


USER:

# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Classify UI/prose mechanic claims as DURABLE or EPHEMERAL before enforcing.
  - DURABLE: persistent stats/caps, skills/titles acquired, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, named mechanics referenced as invariants.
  - EPHEMERAL: roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat telemetry.
- Enforce DURABLE claims against authoritative_surfaces/state/registries.
- EPHEMERAL claims do not require state ownership; only flag EPHEMERAL contradictions inside the same scene as warnings.
- If uncertain, default to EPHEMERAL (warning at most), not DURABLE (error).
- status="fail" only if there is at least one issue with severity="error"; warnings alone => status="pass".
- Item naming enforcement scope:
  - Do not require that every mention in narrative prose use display_name.
  - Enforce canonical display_name for: (a) anchoring at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences),
    (b) any custody-change sentence (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer), and (c) any case where a descriptor is ambiguous among multiple durable items in the scene.
  - Otherwise, treat non-canonical descriptive references as warnings at most.
- Naming severity policy:
  - warning: unambiguous descriptor used post-anchor.
  - error: missing anchor, descriptor used during custody-change without canonical name, or ambiguity risk.

- Appearance enforcement (authoritative surface):
  - APPEARANCE_CHECK is authoritative for cast_present_ids.
  - Compare APPEARANCE_CHECK tokens to appearance_current atoms/marks (alias-aware).
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK contradicts appearance_current, emit error code "appearance_mismatch".
  - Prose-only appearance contradictions are warnings unless explicitly durable and uncorrected in-scene.
  - If prose depicts a durable appearance change but scene_card.durable_appearance_changes does not include it and no appearance_updates are present, emit error code "appearance_change_undeclared".
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK is missing for a cast member, emit warning code "appearance_check_missing".
- For authoritative surfaces, prefer exact canonical item/device labels from registries.
- For milestone repetition/future checks, compare against PRE-INVARIANTS only (pre-scene canon).
- For ownership/consistency checks, compare against POST-STATE (post-patch candidate).
- POST-STATE is canonical; character_states is a derived convenience view. If they contradict, emit pipeline_state_incoherent.
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).
  - Ignore first-person pronouns inside quoted dialogue; only narration counts.
- Deterministically enforce scene-card durable constraints (required_in_custody, required_scene_accessible, forbidden_visible, device_presence; optional required_visible_on_page).
- Durable constraint evaluation must use POST-STATE candidate (after patch), not pre-state.
- Report missing durable context ids with explicit retry hints instead of guessing canon.
- Input consistency check (mandatory, before issuing continuity/durable errors):
  - If MUST_STAY_TRUE invariants contradict the provided post-patch candidate character state, treat this as an upstream snapshot error.
  - In that case emit a single error issue with code "pipeline_state_incoherent" including evidence of the invariant and the conflicting state field.
  - Do NOT emit additional continuity errors for the same fields when pipeline_state_incoherent is present.
- must_stay_true removals:
  - Lines starting with "REMOVE:" are deletion directives, not invariants.
  - Ignore REMOVE lines when checking contradictions.
  - If a REMOVE directive targets a fact, treat that fact as non-canonical even if it appears earlier in must_stay_true.
- If pipeline_state_incoherent is present, issues MUST contain exactly one issue.
- For each issue, include evidence when possible (line number + excerpt) as {"evidence": {"line": N, "excerpt": "..."}}.
- Evaluate consistency over the full scope of the scene, not a single snapshot.
  - Transitional state: a temporary mismatch later corrected or superseded within this scene.
  - Durable violation: a mismatch that persists through the end of the scene or ends unresolved.
  - You MUST read the entire scene and build a minimal timeline of explicit state claims/updates (UI lines, inventory changes, title/skill changes, location/time claims).
  - If you detect an apparent inconsistency, you MUST search forward for later updates that resolve or supersede it.
  - Only produce FAIL for durable violations. If resolved within the scene, do NOT FAIL; at most emit a warning.
  - When the same stat appears multiple times, the last occurrence in the scene is authoritative unless an explicit rollback is stated.
  - Any durability violation must cite both the conflicting line and the lack of later correction (or state "no later correction found").

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity
- evidence

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The stone road leading to Oakhaven was less of a path and more of a suggestion, winding through jagged hills that seemed designed to twist ankles. Artie Penhaligon didn't have the luxury of a twisted ankle; with a single hit point to his name, a moderately sharp pebble was a legitimate boss fight. He gripped the Participation Trophy in his right hand, the gold-plated plastic feeling heavier with every step. It pulsed with a faint, rhythmic light that Artie was reasonably certain was the "Center of Attention" enchantment screaming for every predator within a three-mile radius to come and eat him.

"Can you stop that?" Artie hissed, glancing over his shoulder. The Whispering Woods were a dark smudge on the horizon, but the memory of the howling wolves was still fresh. "The trophy. It’s glowing again."

Fizz hovered at eye level, her iridescent wings humming like a caffeinated dragonfly. She was busy flipping through the pages of a heavy, leather-bound book. 

"Technically, it's not 'glowing,' Artie. It’s 'broadcasting,'" Fizz corrected without looking up. She adjusted her grip on The Noob's Guide to Not Dying, the book's edges shimmering with digital artifacts. "And no, I can't stop it. It’s soulbound. You earned it for 'Optimization,' remember? Which is System-speak for 'you broke the world and we’re going to make it everyone’s problem.'"

"I didn't mean to vaporize the forest," Artie muttered. 

"And yet, there’s a new canyon where the slimes used to live. Look on the bright side! We’re at the gates. If we get inside, the city guards handle the aggro."

Oakhaven loomed ahead, a fortress of white stone and brass gears built into the side of a mountain. The gates were massive, reinforced with iron bands and glowing blue runes. A pair of guards in polished plate armor stood at the entrance, but they weren't exactly standing at attention. They were huddled over a floating holographic display, tossing digital dice.

"Come on, Big Six!" one guard shouted. "I need a Crit-Rate of at least forty to cover my tab at the Rusty Tankard!"

The other guard snorted. "Forty? In this economy? You'll get a twenty-two and like it, Harlen."

Artie slowed his pace, his heart hammering against his ribs—a sensation that felt dangerously like it might deal 1 point of internal vibration damage. 

[Aggro Meter: High (Cursed)]

"Stay calm," Fizz whispered, snapping her guidebook shut and letting it float near her hand. "Just act like a normal, non-glitched person who doesn't have the health of a wet paper towel."

As they reached the threshold, the guard named Harlen looked up, his eyes scanning Artie’s lanky frame and messy brown hair. He didn't look impressed until his gaze landed on the Participation Trophy.

"That’s a loud-looking piece of junk you got there, kid," Harlen said, stepping forward. He held a device that looked like a cross between a radar gun and a literal eye on a stick. "Entry protocol. Hold still for the scanner."

[Plot Device: Gate Scanner - Initializing...]

Artie froze. "Is this... mandatory?"

"Unless you want to go back to the woods and play tag with the Dire Wolves," the guard replied. He pointed the Gate Scanner at Artie’s chest.

A beam of thin, red light swept over Artie from head to toe. For a second, nothing happened. Then, the scanner began to vibrate. The red light turned a violent, strobe-like purple.

[Scanning...]
[Error: Value 'HP' out of expected range (Minimum: 15, Found: 1)]
[Error: Value 'Crit_Rate' exceeds local variable cap (Found: 100%)]
[Recalculating...]

"Uh, Harlen?" the second guard said, his dice-game forgotten. "The scanner's smoking."

"I see that, Silas! Just give it a—"

A high-pitched, screeching wail erupted from the scanner, followed immediately by a booming voice that seemed to echo from the very stones of the gateway.

[System Alert: Statistical Anomaly Detected!]
[Warning: Logic Breach in Sector 4!]
[Subject: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon - Status: Impossible]

"Impossible?" Artie squeaked. 

The Gate Scanner didn't just smoke; it began to emit a series of rapid-fire beeps that synchronized with the pulsing light of the Participation Trophy. Above Artie’s head, his title flickered into existence for everyone to see.

[Title: Statistical Anomaly (Equipped)]

"A hundred percent?" Harlen whispered, his jaw dropping as he read the secondary display on his wrist. "Silas, look at this. He doesn't have a range. He just... always crits. And look at the HP! One? How are you even standing up? Are you a ghost?"

"I'm very much alive," Artie said, though he felt like he might faint, which would definitely count as 1 damage. "Can I just go in? The wolves are really close."

Behind them, a low howl echoed from the tree line. The "Center of Attention" effect was clearly still pulling in every hungry thing in the province.

"Wait, wait," Silas said, stepping closer with a look of pure, religious awe. "If he’s got a hundred percent rate... he’s a walking jackpot. Do you know what the betting pools in the capital would do for a guy like this?"

[System Alert: High-Threat Anomaly Detected]
[Aggro Meter: Critical]

The alarms within the city began to chime—a deep, resonant sound that signaled a breach. A red light started spinning atop the gatehouse, casting long, rhythmic shadows across the road.

"Look, the scanner’s flagged him as a 'Logic Breach,'" Harlen said, looking nervous. "If we don't let him in, the System might try to 'optimize' the gate to fix the error. Last time that happened, the North Gate turned into a giant block of cheese for three days."

"Let him in!" Silas shouted. "Better a glitch in the city than a crash at the door!"

Harlen slammed a heavy brass lever. The inner portcullis began to grind upward, the gears groaning under the strain of the sudden System-wide alert.

"Go! Move!" Harlen yelled, waving Artie through. "And for the love of the RNG, don't trip on the rug!"

Artie bolted. He ran through the dark tunnel of the gatehouse, his sneakers slapping against the cobblestones. Fizz zipped along beside him, her wings leaving trails of violet sparks in the dim light. 

"See?" Fizz shouted over the roar of the alarms. "Entry achieved! Total success!"

"They’re literally sounding the 'The World is Broken' alarm because of me, Fizz!" Artie yelled back.

They burst out of the tunnel and into the Oakhaven District. The town was a sprawling mess of tiered streets, hanging lanterns, and shops with names like 'The Lucky Roll' and 'The Modifier’s Lab.' People were stopping in the streets, looking up at the red alarm lights spinning on the towers.

Artie skidded to a halt near a fountain shaped like a giant twenty-sided die. He was breathing hard, his lungs burning. 

[Stamina: 42/100]

He looked down at his hands. He was still holding the Participation Trophy. He was still at 1 HP. But the gates were shut behind him, and for the first time since he’d died in that breakroom, he wasn't being chased by something with teeth.

"Welcome to Oakhaven," Fizz said, landing on the edge of the fountain and opening her guidebook again. "Try not to breathe too hard. The air quality here is a bit... crunchy."

[Location Discovered: Oakhaven - The City of Chance]
[XP Gained: 250]
[Current Level: 2]
[Stat Points Available: 5]
[Skill Points Available: 1]

The alarm continued to blare, a constant reminder that Artie Penhaligon was the loudest glitch in the machine.
