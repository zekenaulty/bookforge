  "text": "PROSE:\nThe bronze-shod heels of Kaelen\u2019s boots dragged across the flagstones, leaving twin streaks of soot and dried ichor. The silence of the High Spire was a physical weight, heavier even than the throbbing ache in his cauterized shoulder. Usually, this hall hummed with the rhythmic strike of the practice yard and the low, constant murmur of the initiates\u2019 litany. Now, the only sound was the wet, ragged hitch of his own lungs and the high-pitched vibration emanating from the mark on his collarbone.\n\nThe oath-mark didn\u2019t just itch anymore. It burned with a rhythmic, pulsing heat that felt like a needle of white-hot wire threading through his veins. Every time his heart hammered against his ribs, the new white veins in the mark flared, casting a pale, sickly light against the underside of his jaw. He leaned his weight against a fluted pillar, the cold stone doing nothing to dampen the fever raging beneath his skin. \n\n\"Commander?\" Kaelen\u2019s voice was a dry rasp. It died in the rafters, swallowed by the shadows that seemed thicker, more viscous than they had been only two days ago.\n\nHe pushed off the pillar, his legs trembling. The inner sanctum doors stood ajar. One of the massive oak panels hung crookedly on a shattered hinge, the wood splintered as if something immense had leaned against it until it gave way. Kaelen stepped over the debris, his hand instinctively reaching for a sword that wasn't there. He had lost his blade in the crater, swallowed by the same star-fire that had branded him.\n\nThe scent hit him before he saw the source. It wasn't the stench of a battlefield\u2014the iron and offal\u2014but something sharper. It was the smell of scorched tin and old pennies, a metallic tang that coated the tongue and made the teeth ache. \n\nIn the center of the map room, slumped over the great slate table, was a figure. \n\n\"Varkas,\" Kaelen breathed, the name a prayer and a plea.\n\nThe Commander didn\u2019t move. He was draped in his heavy ceremonial furs, but they sat strangely on his frame, as if the man beneath had grown rigid and angular. Kaelen stumbled forward, his boots crunching on something brittle. Looking down, he saw a dusting of fine, mercurial powder covering the floor, shimmering like ground glass in the dim light.\n\n\"Commander, the star... I bound it. It\u2019s done, but the others\u2014they didn't make it.\" Kaelen reached out, his fingers hovering inches from Varkas\u2019s shoulder. \"I need the Weaver. The mark is changing. It\u2019s burning me out from the inside.\"\n\nVarkas shifted. It wasn't the fluid movement of a veteran soldier, but the jerky, ratcheting motion of a rusted gear. As he turned, the fur mantle slid from his shoulder, revealing a neck that was no longer flesh. \n\nThe silver rot had progressed with a terrifying, unnatural speed. Where skin should have been, there were tessellated plates of dull, metallic growth. They looked like overlapping scales of lead, fused directly into the muscle. The rot had climbed up the side of Varkas\u2019s jaw, calcifying the jawline into a jagged, unmoving ridge. Most horrific were the eyes; the irises had bled into the whites, replaced by a swirling, pearlescent film that caught the light of Kaelen\u2019s glowing oath-mark.\n\n\"Kaelen,\" Varkas said. The voice didn't come from his throat. It vibrated out of his chest, a grinding sound like stones being crushed in a mill. \"You... brought it... here.\"\n\n\"I did what the oath required,\" Kaelen said, recoiling. He hit the edge of the slate table, his hand brushing a discarded map. The parchment crumbled into silver ash at his touch. \"The star-shard is bound. You said the Spire would hold. You said the Weaver would know what to do.\"\n\nVarkas stood. He rose to his full, imposing height, but his spine didn't curve. He moved as a single, solid piece of living sculpture. As he stepped into the light, Kaelen saw that the Commander\u2019s right hand had fused into a jagged, three-pronged spike of dull silver. The corruption wasn't just on him; it was consuming him, rewriting his biology into something inorganic and cold.\n\n\"The Weaver is... silent,\" Varkas ground out. A drop of thick, mercury-colored fluid leaked from the corner of his eye and tracked down his metallic cheek. \"The stars do not fall to be bound, boy. They fall to... harvest.\"\n\nVarkas raised the silver spike that had been his hand. The air around him began to hum with the same frequency as the shard in the crater, a low-end thrum that made Kaelen\u2019s vision blur. The white veins in Kaelen\u2019s oath-mark reacted violently, lashing out with heat that forced a scream from his throat.\n\n\"You aren't the Commander,\" Kaelen hissed, clutching his shoulder as he backed toward the shattered door. \n\n\"I am... the vessel,\" Varkas replied. He took a step forward, his heavy boots cracking the flagstones. There was no recognition in those pearlescent eyes, only a hollow, starving void. \n\nKaelen looked past Varkas, toward the high windows of the sanctum. Beyond the glass, the other towers of High Spire were dark. No signal fires burned. No guards patrolled the battlements. The silence wasn't a result of a struggle; it was the silence of a tomb already sealed. The support he had nearly died to return to was gone. The man who had trained him was a shell, a puppet for the very corruption they were sworn to fight.\n\nVarkas lunged. He moved with a sudden, explosive force that belied his stiff gait. The silver spike whistled through the air, shearing through the corner of the heavy slate table as if it were wet clay. \n\nKaelen threw himself to the side, his shoulder screaming in protest as he rolled across the glass-dusted floor. He scrambled to his feet, heart hammering against the white-hot veins of his mark. He wasn't a soldier returning to his base; he was a survivor trapped in a nest of the enemy. The Spire had fallen, and the only thing left of his mentor was a hunger for the light currently burning a hole in Kaelen's soul.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_kaelen\",\n      \"CHAR_commander_varkas\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"High Spire - Inner Sanctum\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Kaelen discovered High Spire is silent and largely unguarded.\",\n      \"Commander Varkas has been almost entirely consumed by silver rot, his body transforming into a metallic, crystalline entity.\",\n      \"Varkas attacked Kaelen, indicating the corruption has stripped away his former identity and loyalty.\",\n      \"The silver rot is spreading to the environment of the Spire, turning organic matter into ash and dust.\",\n      \"Kaelen realizes the leadership of the Spire has fallen and he is no longer safe there.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_oath_binding\",\n      \"THREAD_starfall_corruption\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",

Your writing is characterized by a tight, limited third-person perspective that never breaks into omniscient narration. You must maintain strict continuity, ensuring that characters utilize their full range of established skills and knowledge. Do not use 'As you know' dialogue or provide summaries of previous events. When a scene begins, drop the reader directly into the character's current sensory experience. Avoid clich\u00e9s in descriptions; instead of 'cold as ice,' describe the 'brittle, biting snap of air that makes the lungs ache.' Ensure all plot payoffs are seeded with subtle clues in earlier movements. Magic and high-fantasy elements must have clear costs and logical consistency.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\n",

Every step through the knee-deep peat required a deliberate shift of weight, a calculated gamble against the suction of the black mud. To rush was to sink; to hesitate was to let the stinging gnats find the gaps in the leather greaves.\n\nThe silver needle of the compass didn\u2019t spin; it shuddered, vibrating with a frequency that numbed the thumb pressing against the casing. This wasn't the erratic jitter of a magnetic anomaly, but the rhythmic, heavy thrum of a tethered ley-line. It pulled at the marrow, a dull ache in the long bones that signaled the proximity of a ruptured seal. The price of such proximity was always paid in blood-sugar and breath; the lungs felt scorched, as if the very oxygen had been thinned by the invisible pressure.\n\nA jagged obsidian shard protruded from a stump of petrified oak. It didn't just sit in the light; it seemed to drink it, casting a shadow that fell toward the sun rather than away. Touching it would be a mistake\u2014the last time a finger had brushed a similar fracture, the skin had turned the color of a bruised plum and stayed cold for a week. Instead, the focus remained on the tension of the wire stretched across the path, nearly invisible against the gray mist. It was set at mid-thigh height, weighted with a lead sinker to ensure it wouldn't flutter in the wind. A simple trap, but one that required a steady hand and a sharp eye to bypass without tripping the chime hidden in the hollow log nearby. The world didn't offer warnings, only consequences recorded in the stiffness of joints and the steady, rhythmic thud of a heart working too hard against a thinning atmosphere.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 6\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"outline\": {\n    \"path\": \"outline/outline.json\"\n  },\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_001/scene_006.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"DRAFTING\",\n  \"world\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_kaelen\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"The Impact Crater (High Spire Valley)\",\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_oath_binding\",\n      \"THREAD_starfall_corruption\"\n    ],\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Kaelen successfully bound the volatile star-shard to his oath-mark through a violent metaphysical process.\",\n      \"The oath-mark has transitioned from solid black to a swirling pattern of midnight and white-hot veins.\",\n      \"Kaelen's shoulder wound has been cauterized by the energy of the binding, though he remains in a state of extreme physical exhaustion.\",\n      \"Kaelen has begun the treacherous climb out of the crater toward High Spire.\"\n    ],\n    \"time\": {}\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n"
