PROSE:
The bronze-shod heels of Kaelen’s boots dragged across the flagstones, leaving twin streaks of soot and dried ichor. The silence of the High Spire was a physical weight, heavier even than the throbbing ache in his cauterized shoulder. Usually, this hall hummed with the rhythmic strike of the practice yard and the low, constant murmur of the initiates’ litany. Now, the only sound was the wet, ragged hitch of his own lungs and the high-pitched vibration emanating from the mark on his collarbone.

The oath-mark didn’t just itch anymore. It burned with a rhythmic, pulsing heat that felt like a needle of white-hot wire threading through his veins. Every time his heart hammered against his ribs, the new white veins in the mark flared, casting a pale, sickly light against the underside of his jaw. He leaned his weight against a fluted pillar, the cold stone doing nothing to dampen the fever raging beneath his skin. 

"Commander?" Kaelen’s voice was a dry rasp. It died in the rafters, swallowed by the shadows that seemed thicker, more viscous than they had been only two days ago.

He pushed off the pillar, his legs trembling. The inner sanctum doors stood ajar. One of the massive oak panels hung crookedly on a shattered hinge, the wood splintered as if something immense had leaned against it until it gave way. Kaelen stepped over the debris, his hand instinctively reaching for a sword that wasn't there. He had lost his blade in the crater, swallowed by the same star-fire that had branded him.

The scent hit him before he saw the source. It wasn't the stench of a battlefield—the iron and offal—but something sharper. It was the smell of scorched tin and old pennies, a metallic tang that coated the tongue and made the teeth ache. 

In the center of the map room, slumped over the great slate table, was a figure. 

"Varkas," Kaelen breathed, the name a prayer and a plea.

The Commander didn’t move. He was draped in his heavy ceremonial furs, but they sat strangely on his frame, as if the man beneath had grown rigid and angular. Kaelen stumbled forward, his boots crunching on something brittle. Looking down, he saw a dusting of fine, mercurial powder covering the floor, shimmering like ground glass in the dim light.

"Commander, the star... I bound it. It’s done, but the others—they didn't make it." Kaelen reached out, his fingers hovering inches from Varkas’s shoulder. "I need the Weaver. The mark is changing. It’s burning me out from the inside."

Varkas shifted. It wasn't the fluid movement of a veteran soldier, but the jerky, ratcheting motion of a rusted gear. As he turned, the fur mantle slid from his shoulder, revealing a neck that was no longer flesh. 

The silver rot had progressed with a terrifying, unnatural speed. Where skin should have been, there were tessellated plates of dull, metallic growth. They looked like overlapping scales of lead, fused directly into the muscle. The rot had climbed up the side of Varkas’s jaw, calcifying the jawline into a jagged, unmoving ridge. Most horrific were the eyes; the irises had bled into the whites, replaced by a swirling, pearlescent film that caught the light of Kaelen’s glowing oath-mark.

"Kaelen," Varkas said. The voice didn't come from his throat. It vibrated out of his chest, a grinding sound like stones being crushed in a mill. "You... brought it... here."

"I did what the oath required," Kaelen said, recoiling. He hit the edge of the slate table, his hand brushing a discarded map. The parchment crumbled into silver ash at his touch. "The star-shard is bound. You said the Spire would hold. You said the Weaver would know what to do."

Varkas stood. He rose to his full, imposing height, but his spine didn't curve. He moved as a single, solid piece of living sculpture. As he stepped into the light, Kaelen saw that the Commander’s right hand had fused into a jagged, three-pronged spike of dull silver. The corruption wasn't just on him; it was consuming him, rewriting his biology into something inorganic and cold.

"The Weaver is... silent," Varkas ground out. A drop of thick, mercury-colored fluid leaked from the corner of his eye and tracked down his metallic cheek. "The stars do not fall to be bound, boy. They fall to... harvest."

Varkas raised the silver spike that had been his hand. The air around him began to hum with the same frequency as the shard in the crater, a low-end thrum that made Kaelen’s vision blur. The white veins in Kaelen’s oath-mark reacted violently, lashing out with heat that forced a scream from his throat.

"You aren't the Commander," Kaelen hissed, clutching his shoulder as he backed toward the shattered door. 

"I am... the vessel," Varkas replied. He took a step forward, his heavy boots cracking the flagstones. There was no recognition in those pearlescent eyes, only a hollow, starving void. 

Kaelen looked past Varkas, toward the high windows of the sanctum. Beyond the glass, the other towers of High Spire were dark. No signal fires burned. No guards patrolled the battlements. The silence wasn't a result of a struggle; it was the silence of a tomb already sealed. The support he had nearly died to return to was gone. The man who had trained him was a shell, a puppet for the very corruption they were sworn to fight.

Varkas lunged. He moved with a sudden, explosive force that belied his stiff gait. The silver spike whistled through the air, shearing through the corner of the heavy slate table as if it were wet clay. 

Kaelen threw himself to the side, his shoulder screaming in protest as he rolled across the glass-dusted floor. He scrambled to his feet, heart hammering against the white-hot veins of his mark. He wasn't a soldier returning to his base; he was a survivor trapped in a nest of the enemy. The Spire had fallen, and the only thing left of his mentor was a hunger for the light currently burning a hole in Kaelen's soul.
