It was a jagged red eye that was currently pulsing with an angry, rhythmic light.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 94% (Rising...)]\n\nA low, guttural growl echoed from the shadows of the remaining trees. Then another. And a third that sounded like a blender full of gravel. The \"lush forest\" suddenly felt a lot less like a tutorial zone and a lot more like a buffet where I was the only thing on the menu.\n\n\"The slime,\" I whispered, my heart hammering against my ribs. \"The explosion. Did it attract them?\"\n\n\"The explosion was the dinner bell,\" Fizz said, her voice rising an octave. \"The trophy is the GPS coordinates. Artie, you have exactly one hit point.

My Corporate ID Badge bounced painfully against my collarbone with every step.\n\n[Stamina: 92/100]\n\nThe forest, which had seemed peaceful ten minutes ago, was now a cacophony of snapping branches and predatory shrieks. To my left, a pair of glowing red eyes burst through a thicket of ferns. I didn't stay to see what they belonged to.

It's called 'Adrenaline and Terror'!\" Fizz shouted, hovering effortlessly beside my ear. \"Left! Go left!

I nearly lost my balance, which would have been a death sentence.\n\n[Stamina: 75/100]\n\n[HP: 1/1]\n\nThe absurdity of it hit me even as I dodged a low-hanging branch. I was a Level 2 \"Statistical Anomaly\" with the power to vaporize gods, but I was currently being hunted by bunnies because I was holding a piece of plastic that made me smell like a target.\n\n\"Can I put the trophy in my pocket?\" I yelled over the sound of something large and heavy crashing through the underbrush behind us.\n\n\"It\u2019s a beacon, Artie!

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nUI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says \"always include\".\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it unless explicitly removing a stale fact with REMOVE and restating the current truth.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v2\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\n\ufeffOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\":

        "content": "# WRITE\nWrite the scene described by the scene card.\n- YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN PROSE AND THE STATE_PATCH.\n- Start in motion. No recap.\n- Summaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\n- Use the continuity pack and state for continuity.\n- Use character_registry to keep names consistent in prose.\n- Timeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\n- State primacy: pre-scene invariants and summary facts are binding unless the Scene Card depicts a change. If this scene changes a durable fact, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value and remove the old entry.\n- Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n- must_stay_true is end-of-scene truth only (last occurrence wins); do not keep earlier values that are superseded by the scene.\n- must_stay_true removal (mandatory when a durable fact is superseded):\n  - Add \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" in summary_update.must_stay_true.\n  - Place REMOVE lines before the new final invariant.\n  - REMOVE lines also apply to key_facts_ring (purge stale facts from continuity).\n- Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\n- Inventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- Inventory posture reconciliation:\n  - If inventory/containers change (held/stowed/container), must_stay_true must be updated to the final posture.\n  - Add REMOVE lines for prior inventory/container invariants before the new final entries.\n  - Use canonical invariant formats:\n    - inventory: CHAR_X -> <item display_name> (status=held|carried|equipped|stowed, container=hand_left|hand_right|<container>)\n    - container: <container> (owner=CHAR_X, contents=[<item display_name>, ...])\n- must_stay_true is end-of-scene truth only (last occurrence wins); do not keep earlier values that are superseded by the scene.\n\n- For held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\n- Continuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.\n- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.\n- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.\n- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI gate: only include bracketed UI blocks when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If false, do not include UI blocks; rephrase into narrative prose.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or a short parenthetical annotation (e.g., (locked), (Warning: ...)).\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\n- titles are arrays of objects with stable name fields; do not emit titles as plain strings.\n- If item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for ownership/custody labels in authoritative outputs.\n- Use item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If a durable appearance change occurs in this scene, record it in character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- APPEARANCE_CHECK is required in COMPLIANCE for each cast_present_id (4-8 tokens from atoms/marks).\n\nDurable item naming discipline:\n- When you first describe a durable item, anchor it by using the canonical display_name within the same paragraph (or within the next 2 sentences).\n- After anchoring, you may use brief descriptors for style if unambiguous.\n- During any custody/handling change, include the canonical display_name in that sentence.\n- If a required event is not in the Scene Card, do not perform it.\n- Enforce scene-card durable constraints: honor `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, and `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\n- Respect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope` when proposing durable mutations; do not mutate physical custody in non-present/non-real scope unless explicitly marked override.\n- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):\n  - If timeline_scope != \"present\" OR ontological_scope != \"real\", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).\n  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.\n  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category=\"timeline_override\".\n- summary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\n- STATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\n- must_stay_true is end-of-scene truth only (last occurrence wins); do not keep earlier values that are superseded by the scene.\n\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\n- must_stay_true is end-of-scene truth only (last occurrence wins); do not keep earlier values that are superseded by the scene.\n\n- If state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\n- must_stay_true is end-of-scene truth only (last occurrence wins); do not keep earlier values that are superseded by the scene.\n\n- Return prose plus a state_patch JSON block.\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- must_stay_true is end-of-scene truth only (last occurrence wins); do not keep earlier values that are superseded by the scene.\n\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects.

Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n- Transfer vs registry conflict rule (must follow):\n  - If you create a NEW item in item_registry_updates with final custodian already set (e.g., CHAR_ARTIE), DO NOT emit transfer_updates for that item.\n  - If you emit transfer_updates for a NEW item, the registry entry must start with custodian=\"world\" and then transfer to the character.\n  - expected_before must match the registry entry at the moment of transfer (after any registry update that applies before it).  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects; never an object with an `updates` field.\n- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.\n- If you mutate durable state, do not leave the same mutation only in prose.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n- appearance_updates: when a durable appearance change happens, include appearance_updates on the relevant character_updates entry.\n  - appearance_updates MUST be an object, not an array.\n    - INVALID: \"appearance_updates\": [{\"set\": {...}, \"reason\": \"...\"}]\n    - VALID: \"appearance_updates\": {\"set\": {\"marks_add\": [{\"name\": \"Singed Hair\", \"location\": \"head\", \"durability\": \"durable\"}]}, \"reason\": \"...\"}\n  - appearance_updates.set may include atoms and marks only (canonical truth).\n    - Do NOT put marks_add at the top level;

At my current Strength of 12, with a base weapon damage of 4-6, I was looking at a nine-hit kill minimum, assuming the RNG gods didn't decide to spit on my shoes today. \n\n\"You know,\" I said, adjusting my grip on the rusted shortsword. \"In most worlds, puddles are for stepping in, not for getting dissolved by.\"\n\nThe slime responded by launching a glob of corrosive mucus.
