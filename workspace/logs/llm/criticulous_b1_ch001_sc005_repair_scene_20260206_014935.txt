PROSE:
The smoke from the vaporized oak tree hadn't even cleared before the System started chirping in Artie’s ear like a caffeinated cricket. The crater beneath his boots was still cooling, the edges of the dirt turned to a jagged, obsidian-slick glass by the sheer magnitude of the overkill. He stood in the center of the devastation, his right hand still white-knuckled around the hilt of the Rusty Shortsword (Prop). It felt less like a weapon now and more like a detonator for a tactical nuke.

[System Notification: Combat Resolved!]
[Experience Gained: 500 (Overkill Bonus: +450%)]
[Level Up! You are now Level 2.]
[Stat Points Gained: 5 (Unallocated)]

"Five points," Artie wheezed, waving his left hand to clear the acrid scent of burnt cellulose and ionized slime. "I almost die to a puddle of grape jelly, blow up a landmark, and all I get is five points? I could put these into Vitality and I’d still be one stubbed toe away from a game over screen."

"Don't be ungrateful, Artie," Fizz said, fluttering down to hover just outside the range of the lingering heat. She looked remarkably pristine for someone who had just witnessed a localized disaster. "Most players have to spend hours bopping bunnies to get that kind of progress. You just skipped the tutorial curve and went straight to 'Environmental Hazard' status. The System loves a good show."

Artie looked at the floating blue window displaying his stats. 

[Name: Arthur Penhaligon]
[Level: 2]
[HP: 1/1]
[Crit Rate: 100% (FIXED)]
[Available Stat Points: 5]

The '1/1' pulsed with a faint, mocking red light. It was a constant reminder that in this world, Artie wasn't a hero; he was a fragile piece of glass being carried through a rock-throwing contest. He reached out a finger to tap the '+' next to Constitution, but hesitated. The math just didn't add up.

"If I put all five into health," Artie asked, "how many hits can I take from that slime's bigger brother?"

Fizz tilted her head, her translucent wings humming. "Let's see. Base Level 1 Slime damage is 2. Your current HP is 1. If you dump all five points into Vitality, assuming a standard 5-to-1 scaling ratio... you'd have 26 HP. So, about thirteen hits."

"Thirteen?" Artie scoffed. "That’s not a build. That’s a slightly more durable snack. If I’m going to be a glass cannon, I might as well wait until I can afford the bulletproof glass. I'm keeping the points for now. Maybe there's an 'Evasion' stat I can dump them into later so I never get touched in the first place."

"Suit yourself," Fizz shrugged, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "But look on the bright side. You’ve triggered the 'First Blood' reward protocol. The System is feeling generous. Or at least, as generous as a line of code can be."

A golden light began to coalesce in the air three feet in front of Artie. It wasn't the soft, ethereal glow of a holy spell; it was the harsh, flickering neon of a 'Grand Opening' sign at a discount mattress store. With a sound like a slide whistle, a heavy object materialized and dropped toward the ground.

Artie’s heart skipped. He lunged forward, catching the object in his left hand just inches before it hit the glassed floor of the crater. 

"Easy there!" he gasped, his knees trembling. "If this thing had hit the ground and made a vibration, I’d probably have shattered into a million pieces. Does the System not understand the concept of 'fragile'?"

[Item Acquired: The Participation Trophy (Tutorial Edition)]
[Rarity: Rare (Cursed)]
[Type: Accessory / Held Item]
[Stats: +1 Charisma, +5% Ego]
[Hidden Stat: ???]
[Description: You did it! You survived long enough to press a button. This trophy is gold-plated, hollow, and surprisingly heavy. It serves as a reminder that even the most incompetent efforts deserve a shiny trinket.]

The trophy was a hideous thing—a golden figure of a generic adventurer tripping over a rock, mounted on a faux-marble base. It was nearly a foot tall and shimmered with a luster that felt... aggressive. It sat heavy in his left hand, the cold metal biting into his palm.

"Charisma?" Artie looked at the trophy in his left hand, then at the rusty prop sword in his right. "I’m in a death-trap RPG and the game gives me a paperweight that makes me more likable? I don't want to be liked, Fizz. I want to be not-dead. This thing is literally a statue of someone failing."

"Oh, it's not just for show," Fizz said, her voice dropping an octave into a tone that Artie was beginning to recognize as 'foreshadowing.' "The System doesn't give out 'Rare' items for nothing. Check the acoustics, Artie. Listen to the rhythm of the world."

"The acoustics?"

Artie shifted his grip on the trophy. As the base of the statue rubbed against his palm, it emitted a low, resonant hum. It wasn't a pleasant sound. It was a rhythmic, thrumming vibration that seemed to bypass Artie’s ears and go straight to his marrow. It felt like a heartbeat—one that wasn't his.

*Thump-thump. Thump-thump.*

The sound began to grow. It wasn't just a hum anymore; it was a broadcast. A golden ripple of light pulsed out from the trophy every two seconds, expanding across the crater and into the surrounding woods like a sonar ping for predators.

[System Warning: 'Aggro Aura' Active.]
[Loudness Level: Spinal Tap (11/10)]
[Effect: You are now the most interesting thing in a five-mile radius. Good luck.]

"Fizz," Artie said, his voice tight as he watched the golden ripples wash over the treeline. "Why is the trophy screaming in light? And why does it feel like the forest just stopped breathing?"

"It’s not screaming," Fizz corrected, looking toward the shadows where the bushes were beginning to shift with alarming speed. "It’s announcing. It’s telling every monster in the Tutorial Zone that there’s a Level 2 anomaly with 1 HP and a very shiny, very expensive-looking prize standing right in the middle of a clearing. It’s basically a dinner bell that rings in 'Legendary' rarity."

A low growl echoed from the north. Then a wet, squelching sound from the east—the sound of multiple slimes congregating. To the south, the brush began to rustle with the frantic energy of a dozen approaching entities.

"Is this the 'Participation' part?" Artie asked, his knuckles whitening around the trophy’s base. "As in, I have to participate in my own funeral?"

"Run would be my suggestion," Fizz said, already beginning to fly toward the western path. "The 'Aggro Aura' is a passive effect. It doesn't turn off until you leave the zone or... well, until the trophy finds a new owner. Usually by looting it off your cold, pixelated corpse."

Artie didn't wait for a second opinion. He tucked the 'Participation Trophy' under his left arm like a golden football, his right hand still white-knuckled around the hilt of the Rusty Shortsword. He scrambled out of the crater, his boots slipping on the smooth glass. 

As he reached the rim, he saw them. Six Lesser Forest Slimes were bouncing toward him from the undergrowth, their translucent bodies filled with the half-digested remains of local flora. Behind them, a pair of 'Lvl 4 Mangy Coyotes' broke through the brush, their eyes locked onto the golden glow emanating from Artie’s armpit.

[Lvl 4 Mangy Coyote] [HP: 60/60]
[Status: Hungry / Highly Attracted to Shiny Things]

"I hate this game!" Artie screamed, his lungs burning as he sprinted toward the narrow gap between two ancient oaks. "I hate the rewards! I hate the math! I especially hate the interior decorating!"

"Less complaining, more cardio!" Fizz shouted over her shoulder, her trail of sparkle dust marking the path. "If one of those coyotes so much as sneezes on you, you’re a ghost! And not the cool, haunting kind!"

Artie pushed his legs harder. His Stamina bar appeared in the corner of his vision, draining with every desperate stride.

[Stamina: 45/100]

Every time the trophy pulsed—*thump-thump*—the monsters behind him let out a collective howl or squelch of renewed vigor. It was like he was carrying a GPS tracker that also insulted the monsters' mothers. He could hear the heavy breathing of the coyotes, the snapping of twigs, and the rhythmic *thump* of the trophy against his ribs.

"Where is the edge of the zone?" Artie yelled, leaping over a protruding root that definitely would have killed him if he’d tripped. 

"Just past the brook!" Fizz pointed toward a shimmering line of blue-white light in the distance. "The Tutorial Zone boundary! Monsters can't cross it without a permit, and most of them are terrible at paperwork!"

"Do they look like they’re checking for permits?" Artie glanced back. The coyotes were gaining. One of them lunged, its snapping jaws missing Artie’s heel by a fraction of an inch. 

[Warning: Near-Miss! 0.1m proximity detected.]

"Too close!" Artie veered wildly to the left, his heart hammering against his chest harder than the trophy’s aura. He could see the boundary now—a shimmering curtain of energy that marked the end of the 'safe' area. He sprinted with everything he had left, the golden trophy glowing brighter with every step, a beacon of doom leading the way toward the exit.
