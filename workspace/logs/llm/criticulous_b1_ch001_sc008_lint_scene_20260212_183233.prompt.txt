# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
Prose hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative ("left hand", "right hand", "Artie", "his wallet").
Item naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.
Appearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Continuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.
Continuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.
Durable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.
JSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.
Inventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

﻿Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.
Durable vs ephemeral mechanics:
- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.
- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.
- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).
- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.
For durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
For durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).
Use canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.
- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.
  - INVALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": {"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}
  - VALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": [{"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}]


USER:

# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Classify UI/prose mechanic claims as DURABLE or EPHEMERAL before enforcing.
  - DURABLE: persistent stats/caps, skills/titles acquired, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, named mechanics referenced as invariants.
  - EPHEMERAL: roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat telemetry.
- Enforce DURABLE claims against authoritative_surfaces/state/registries.
- EPHEMERAL claims do not require state ownership; only flag EPHEMERAL contradictions inside the same scene as warnings.
- If uncertain, default to EPHEMERAL (warning at most), not DURABLE (error).
- status="fail" only if there is at least one issue with severity="error"; warnings alone => status="pass".
- Item naming enforcement scope:
  - Do not require that every mention in narrative prose use display_name.
  - Enforce canonical display_name for: (a) anchoring at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences),
    (b) any custody-change sentence (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer), and (c) any case where a descriptor is ambiguous among multiple durable items in the scene.
  - Otherwise, treat non-canonical descriptive references as warnings at most.
- Naming severity policy:
  - warning: unambiguous descriptor used post-anchor.
  - error: missing anchor, descriptor used during custody-change without canonical name, or ambiguity risk.

- Appearance enforcement (authoritative surface):
  - APPEARANCE_CHECK is authoritative for cast_present_ids.
  - Compare APPEARANCE_CHECK tokens to appearance_current atoms/marks (alias-aware).
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK contradicts appearance_current, emit error code "appearance_mismatch".
  - Prose-only appearance contradictions are warnings unless explicitly durable and uncorrected in-scene.
  - If prose depicts a durable appearance change but scene_card.durable_appearance_changes does not include it and no appearance_updates are present, emit error code "appearance_change_undeclared".
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK is missing for a cast member, emit warning code "appearance_check_missing".
- For authoritative surfaces, prefer exact canonical item/device labels from registries.
- For milestone repetition/future checks, compare against PRE-INVARIANTS only (pre-scene canon).
- For ownership/consistency checks, compare against POST-STATE (post-patch candidate).
- POST-STATE is canonical; character_states is a derived convenience view. If they contradict, emit pipeline_state_incoherent.
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).
  - Ignore first-person pronouns inside quoted dialogue; only narration counts.
- Deterministically enforce scene-card durable constraints (required_in_custody, required_scene_accessible, forbidden_visible, device_presence; optional required_visible_on_page).
- Durable constraint evaluation must use POST-STATE candidate (after patch), not pre-state.
- Report missing durable context ids with explicit retry hints instead of guessing canon.
- Input consistency check (mandatory, before issuing continuity/durable errors):
  - If MUST_STAY_TRUE invariants contradict the provided post-patch candidate character state, treat this as an upstream snapshot error.
  - In that case emit a single error issue with code "pipeline_state_incoherent" including evidence of the invariant and the conflicting state field.
  - Do NOT emit additional continuity errors for the same fields when pipeline_state_incoherent is present.
- must_stay_true removals:
  - Lines starting with "REMOVE:" are deletion directives, not invariants.
  - Ignore REMOVE lines when checking contradictions.
  - If a REMOVE directive targets a fact, treat that fact as non-canonical even if it appears earlier in must_stay_true.
- If pipeline_state_incoherent is present, issues MUST contain exactly one issue.
- For each issue, include evidence when possible (line number + excerpt) as {"evidence": {"line": N, "excerpt": "..."}}.
- Evaluate consistency over the full scope of the scene, not a single snapshot.
  - Transitional state: a temporary mismatch later corrected or superseded within this scene.
  - Durable violation: a mismatch that persists through the end of the scene or ends unresolved.
  - You MUST read the entire scene and build a minimal timeline of explicit state claims/updates (UI lines, inventory changes, title/skill changes, location/time claims).
  - If you detect an apparent inconsistency, you MUST search forward for later updates that resolve or supersede it.
  - Only produce FAIL for durable violations. If resolved within the scene, do NOT FAIL; at most emit a warning.
  - When the same stat appears multiple times, the last occurrence in the scene is authoritative unless an explicit rollback is stated.
  - Any durability violation must cite both the conflicting line and the lack of later correction (or state "no later correction found").

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity
- evidence

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The shadow that fell across the cobblestones was too sharp, too deliberate to be cast by a simple building. I froze, my fingers cramping around the cold, gilded base of the Participation Trophy. The gold-plated plastic felt heavy in my right hand, a constant, cursed reminder that the System had a very sick sense of humor.

"The Mayor is a man of commerce, but he has no eye for potential," a voice drawled. It was smooth, like expensive whiskey poured over jagged glass.

I turned slowly. Standing ten paces away was a man who looked like he’d been designed by a committee dedicated to the concept of 'Threatening.' He was tall and athletic, his black hair slicked back with military precision. A jagged scar ran through his left eye, which remained a piercing, cold blue despite the disfigurement. He wore dark, articulated leather armor that whispered of high level-requirements and even higher price tags.

[Vane - Lvl 42] [Class: Shadow Stalker] [HP: 450/450]

"Vane, I presume?" I said, trying to keep my voice from cracking. "Look, if you’re here for the trophy, it’s soulbound. Trust me, I’ve tried to drop it. I’ve tried to bury it. I’ve tried to trade it for a ham sandwich. It’s not going anywhere."

Vane didn't laugh. He didn't even blink. He just watched me with the predatory stillness of a hawk watching a field mouse. "I don't care about your trinket, Anomaly. I care about the math. A level 2 with a hundred-percent crit rate? That’s not a player. That’s a mistake."

He reached for his belt. In one fluid motion, he drew a slender, wickedly curved blade. The steel was dark, etched with serpentine patterns that seemed to pulse with a faint, toxic green light. 

"The Viper's Kiss dagger," I muttered, the name appearing in a flickering tooltip as he held the weapon in his right hand.

"They call me the Apex Predator in this district," Vane said, his voice dropping an octave. "And an Apex Predator doesn't allow glitches to roam his territory. But I’m a fair man. Let’s see if that luck of yours holds up under pressure."

A chime rang in my ears, loud and intrusive.

[Duel Request: Vane (Lvl 42) has challenged you to a 'Friendly' Spar!]
[Terms: First to 10% HP or First Blood.]
[Penalty for Refusal: 10% XP Loss and 'Coward' Status for 24 hours.]
[Accept? Y/N]

"Friendly?" I choked out, taking a step back. "I have exactly one hit point, Vane. In your world, 'First Blood' is a minor inconvenience. In mine, it’s a funeral."

"Then don't get hit," Vane replied.

He didn't wait for me to click 'Yes.' He moved. 

He didn't run; he blurred. The Shadow Stalker class wasn't just a name. He became a streak of obsidian against the gray stone of Oakhaven. I didn't have time to think, only to react. My Agility was still a pathetic base stat, but my panic was at an all-time high. 

I swung the Participation Trophy out of sheer reflex.

[Critical Hit! (Object Collision)]
[Damage: 0 (Safe Zone Protection Active)]
[Effect: Aggro Spike!]

The trophy didn't hurt him, but the 'Center of Attention' curse flared to life. A pulse of obnoxious, bright red light erupted from the gold plating, momentarily blinding Vane. He hissed, his Viper's Kiss dagger whistling through the air exactly where my throat had been a microsecond before.

[Stamina: 32/38]

I scrambled backward, my boots slipping on the uneven stones. "I'm not fighting you! I'm leaving! This is a Safe Zone!"

"Nowhere is safe for a glitch," Vane snarled, recovering his vision. He twisted his body, the Viper's Kiss dagger spinning in his grip as he prepared for a second lunge. "The System wants you deleted, Anomaly. I’m just the one holding the eraser."

He came at me again, faster this time. He used a skill—[Shadow Step]—and suddenly he was behind me. I felt the cold air of the blade’s passage against the back of my neck. If he so much as grazed my collar, I was done. Game over. Delete character.

[HP: 1/1] (locked)

"Missed again!" I yelled, though it was more of a whimpering shriek. 

I didn't look back. I dove toward a narrow gap between a weaver’s shop and a closed tavern. It was a filthy, lightless alleyway that smelled of damp wool and old cabbage. 

"You can't run forever!" Vane’s voice echoed behind me, filled with a mounting, dark obsession. "I’ll find the break in your pattern! I’ll see the roll that fails!"

I didn't answer. I shoved the Participation Trophy into my chest to keep it from glowing and ran. I was lanky, I was weak, and I was one sneeze away from death, but I knew how to hide. I’d spent ten years hiding in an office cubicle; hiding in a medieval backstreet was just a change of scenery.

I turned a corner, then another, vaulting over a stack of empty crates. The Aggro Meter on my HUD was still pulsing a violent, angry red, but the distance between me and the 'Apex Predator' was growing.

[Aggro Meter: High (Decreasing)]

I slid behind a heavy oak barrel and held my breath. My heart was hammering against my ribs so hard I thought it might count as self-inflicted bludgeoning damage. I stayed there for a long time, watching the entrance to the alley. 

Vane didn't follow. Not yet. But I could feel it—the weight of his gaze, the way the System seemed to lean toward him. I wasn't just a player anymore. I was a target. And in Oakhaven, the hunt had just begun.
