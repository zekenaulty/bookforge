PROSE:

The fluorescent lights of the breakroom hummed with the specific, soul-sucking frequency of a Tuesday afternoon that had overstayed its welcome. Arthur Penhaligon, known to absolutely no one of importance as Artie, stood before the Snack-O-Matic 3000 like a knight facing a dragon that dealt exclusively in trans-fats and disappointment. 

He was a Junior Data Analyst, a title that sounded much more prestigious than 'the guy who fixes the pivot tables when Brenda in Accounting breaks them.' His pale skin looked even more sallow under the flickering tubes, and his mousy brown hair was a chaotic nest of strands he’d been tugging at since the 9:00 AM stand-up meeting.

Artie looked down at his right hand. He was holding a Crumpled Dollar Bill. It was a sad, limp thing, weathered by too many pockets and perhaps a trip through a washing machine circa 2022. It was his last hope for a mid-afternoon sugar rush to bridge the gap between 'exhausted' and 'comatose.'

"Come on, you bucket of bolts," Artie muttered. his voice was dry, matching the desert-like atmosphere of the office. "Just give me the Nacho Cheese rings. No one has to get hurt."

He smoothed the Crumpled Dollar Bill against the side of the machine, trying to iron out a particularly stubborn crease across George Washington’s forehead. He felt the weight of his Corporate ID Badge tapping against his chest as he leaned forward, the plastic lanyard a heavy reminder of his tether to the corporate machine.

He fed the bill into the slot. The machine groaned, a sound like a geriatric robot clearing its throat. The bill disappeared halfway, paused, and then was spat back out with a contemptuous whir.

"Are you serious?" Artie asked the glass. His hazel eyes narrowed. 

He tried again. Reverse side. Washington facing down. The result was the same: a mechanical rejection that felt deeply personal.

Artie took a breath, reaching into his pocket_left to check his Smartphone, out of habit more than necessity. No notifications. No one was looking for him. No one cared about his struggle against the snack gods. He shoved the phone back into his pocket and pulled his Leather Wallet from his pocket_right, checking for a crisper bill. Nothing but a dry-cleaning receipt and a punch card for a burrito place that had gone out of business three years ago.

It was the Crumpled Dollar Bill or nothing.

"Listen here, you oversized toaster," Artie said, his slender frame tensing. "I have spent six hours looking at spreadsheets. I have corrected four hundred and twelve rows of redundant data. I am a Tier 2 spreadsheet wizard. You are a box that holds chips. Accept the currency."

He shoved the bill in with a level of aggression usually reserved for clicking 'Unsubscribe' on spam emails. This time, the machine didn't just spit it out. It swallowed it whole, then made a sound like a cat choking on a marble. The digital display, which usually promised 'SNACK TIME,' flickered into a series of nonsensical symbols.

Artie’s thumb hovered over the button for E4. He pressed it.

Nothing happened. The coil didn't turn. The Nacho Cheese rings remained tantalizingly out of reach, dangling by a literal thread of plastic.

"Oh, you have got to be kidding me."

He delivered a sharp rap to the glass with his knuckles. The machine didn't budge. He looked around the empty breakroom. The sink was dripping. Somewhere down the hall, a printer was dying a slow, jam-filled death. Artie felt a surge of genuine, unadulterated spite. He wasn't a strong man—his Strength stat, if he’d had one, would have been a generous eight—but he was a frustrated one.

He grabbed the sides of the vending machine. He began to shake it.

"Give! Me! My! Rings!" 

The machine rocked on its uneven legs. Inside, the bags of chips danced. The coil for E4 shivered. Artie’s faint keyboard callus on his right palm burned against the cold metal. He put his shoulder into it, a desperate, uncoordinated heave.

Suddenly, the humming of the fluorescent lights changed. It became a roar. 

The Snack-O-Matic 3000 didn't just tip; it buckled. A blue spark jumped from the coin slot, a jagged arc of electricity that looked far more cinematic than a vending machine had any right to produce. 

Artie didn't have time to let go. He didn't even have time to scream. 

The current hit him like a freight train made of lightning. His vision didn't just go dark; it inverted. He felt his heart skip a beat, then decide to take a permanent vacation. The smell of ozone and singed polyester filled the air. His grip on the machine tightened in a final, involuntary spasm.

In his head, he thought he heard a sound. Not a scream, but a chime. A high-pitched, digital *ding* that resonated through his teeth.

And then, the breakroom was gone.

The humming stopped. The smell of the office—stale coffee and despair—evaporated. 

Artie was no longer standing. He wasn't sitting, either. He was simply *existing* in a space that had no floor, no ceiling, and an alarming lack of Nacho Cheese rings. It was a void of pure, blinding white.

He looked down at his hands. They were still there, but they looked... sharper. The edges of his vision were crisp, like he’d suddenly upgraded his resolution from 720p to 4K. 

"Well," Artie whispered, his voice echoing in a way that suggested the room was both infinite and very small. "That was definitely a crit."

He reached for his lanyard, but the Corporate ID Badge was gone. He felt for his pockets, but his pants felt less like fabric and more like a concept. He was alone in the white, waiting for the loading screen to finish.
