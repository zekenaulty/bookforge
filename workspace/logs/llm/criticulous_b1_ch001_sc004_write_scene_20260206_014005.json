It looked like a giant, sentient glob of lime-flavored Jell-O that had been dropped on a dusty floor and decided to take its resentment out on the world. But as it rippled, its translucent green body quivering with a rhythmic, wet *thwack-thwack-thwack* against the grass, Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon knew better. \n\nIn this world, that lime-flavored Jell-O was a tactical nuke.\n\nArtie\u2019s back hit the rough, uncaring bark of a massive oak tree. The tree had probably stood for a hundred years, witnessing the rise and fall of empires, or at least the spawning of many, many low-level mobs. Now, it was just a backstop for Artie\u2019s impending demise. \n\n[Lesser Forest Slime - Lvl 1]\n[HP: 10/10]\n[Attack: 2]\n\nTwo damage. That was it. If the slime so much as sneezed on him, Artie\u2019s 1 HP would vanish, and he\u2019d be nothing more than a footnote in the System\u2019s error logs. \n\n\"Okay, Artie. Think. You\u2019re an analyst. You analyze things. That\u2019s what it says on the LinkedIn profile you\u2019ll never see again,\" he muttered, his voice cracking. He adjusted his grip on the Rusty Shortsword (Prop). The 'Prop' part of the name really didn't inspire confidence. It felt less like a weapon and more like a piece of stage scenery that had been left out in the rain since the late nineties. \n\nThe slime lunged.\n\nIt didn't move fast, but it moved with a terrifying, singular purpose. It launched itself like a wet beanbag, a wobbling mass of green malice aimed directly at Artie\u2019s midsection.\n\n\"Not today, dessert!\" Artie yelled, swinging the rusted hunk of metal with all the grace of a man trying to swat a fly with a lead pipe.\n\nThe sword whistled through the air. It was a clear, direct path. It should have sliced the slime in half. Instead, the blade seemed to hit an invisible wall an inch away from the green surface. \n\n[Miss!]\n\n\"What? I was right there!\" Artie screamed. The slime landed in the dirt, leaving a sticky trail of goo just inches from his boots. \"That was a hit! I saw it! The hitbox is rigged!\"\n\nThe slime didn't care about Artie\u2019s grievances regarding collision detection. It turned, its entire body compressing like a spring. \n\nArtie didn't wait. He stepped forward, trying to catch the monster while it was recovering. He brought the sword down in a vertical chop, a move he\u2019d seen in a dozen fantasy movies. This time, he was sure. He was focused. He was...\n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe sword buried itself three inches deep into a protruding oak root. The impact jarred Artie\u2019s teeth, sending a vibration up his arm that felt like it was trying to disassemble his elbow. \n\n\"Two!\" Artie gasped, pulling the sword free with a desperate yank. \"That\u2019s two misses on a target the size of a beach ball! I have a 100% Crit rate! How can I crit if I can't even touch the damn thing?\"\n\nThe slime launched again. This time, it aimed higher, going for Artie\u2019s face. He ducked, the green mass flying over his head and slapping against the oak tree behind him with a sound like a wet steak hitting a windowpane. It clung to the bark for a second before sliding down, leaving a steaming trail of corrosive slime.\n\nArtie spun around, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird. He swung a wild, horizontal lash. \n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe blade passed through the space the slime had occupied a millisecond prior. The creature had flattened itself into a pancake, the metal whistling harmlessly over its gelatinous \"head.\"\n\n\"Three,\" Artie whimpered. \"The System is mocking me. It has to be. It\u2019s giving me the power of a god and the accuracy of a stormtrooper with a hangover.\"\n\nHe was sweating now. The Tutorial Zone, which had seemed like a peaceful forest only minutes ago, now felt like a claustrophobic arena. The sunlight filtering through the leaves looked like prison bars. He could hear the wind whistling through the branches, sounding suspiciously like the System Administrator laughing at him.\n\nThe slime reformed, wobbling with what Artie could only describe as smugness. It didn't have eyes, but he felt judged. \n\n\"Alright, you overgrown gummy bear. Let's try this again.\"\n\nHe lunged forward, a desperate thrust. He put his shoulder into it, aiming for the very center of the green mass. \n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe sword slid off the slime\u2019s curved surface as if the creature were coated in industrial-grade Teflon. The momentum carried Artie forward, and he nearly face-planted into the corrosive trail on the tree. He managed to catch himself, his fingers brushing against the bark just inches from a patch of bubbling sap.\n\n\"Four!\" Artie roared, his voice echoing through the trees. \"I am a statistical anomaly! I am the master of the critical hit! I am... currently being outplayed by a puddle!\"\n\nThe slime was preparing its biggest lunge yet. It began to vibrate, its green hue deepening as it gathered its strength. The ground beneath it seemed to tremble\u2014or maybe that was just Artie\u2019s legs. \n\nHe had one chance. He took a deep breath, trying to remember everything he\u2019d ever read about combat. *Center your weight. Watch the tell. Don't blink.*\n\nThe slime exploded off the ground. \n\nArtie swung. It was a perfect arc. It was the swing of a hero. It was the swing of a man who was tired of being a level-zero loser in a world governed by math.\n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe sword hit a low-hanging branch, snapping it clean off. The branch fell, hitting Artie on the shoulder. It didn't do damage\u2014the System apparently didn't count 'embarrassment' as a status effect\u2014but it was the final insult.\n\n\"Five,\" Artie whispered, his eyes wide as the slime hovered in mid-air, inches from his chest. \"I missed five times. I\u2019m dead. I\u2019m actually going to die to a level one slime.\"\n\nTime seemed to slow down. He could see the individual bubbles of gas trapped inside the slime\u2019s body. He could see the way the light refracted through its translucent skin. He could see his own reflection in the green goo, looking small and terrified.\n\nAnd then, something clicked. \n\nIt wasn't a physical movement. It was a feeling in the back of his mind, a sudden alignment of variables. The 100% Critical Hit Rate wasn't just a stat; it was a promise. And the System was finally ready to deliver.\n\nArtie didn't think. He didn't aim. He just let the sword move. \n\nHis right hand, still gripping the Rusty Shortsword (Prop), jerked upward in a short, sharp flick. It wasn't even a full swing. It was a twitch. A glitch in the animation.\n\nThe tip of the rusted blade touched the very edge of the slime.\n\nThe world turned white.\n\n[SUPER-MEGA-ULTRA-CRIT!]\n\nThe sound wasn't a *thwack* or a *slice*. It was the sound of a mountain being shattered by a tuning fork. A pillar of pure, blinding golden light erupted from the point of contact. \n\nThe Level 1 Lesser Forest Slime didn't just die. It ceased to exist. Its molecular structure was dismantled so fast that it didn't even have time to register a death animation. It vaporized into a cloud of green steam that was immediately incinerated by the sheer heat of the crit.\n\nBut the crit wasn't done. \n\nThe energy wave hit the oak tree behind Artie. The hundred-year-old giant, with its massive trunk and sprawling roots, vanished. There was no falling timber, no cracking of wood. There was only a roar of displaced air as the tree was reduced to toothpicks and then to ash in a fraction of a second.\n\nThe shockwave knocked Artie backward, but the System\u2019s weird physics kept him upright. He watched, mouth agape, as the golden light carved a perfect, circular crater into the earth where the tree had stood. The ground was scorched black, the edges of the pit glowing with residual heat.\n\nSilence returned to the Tutorial Zone, broken only by the sound of a few stray leaves fluttering down into the smoking hole.\n\nThen, the notifications started.\n\n[System Notification]\n[Target: Lesser Forest Slime (Lvl 1) - DEFEATED]\n[Damage Dealt: 9,999,999 (Overkill)]\n[Experience Gained: 50 XP]\n\n[Level Up!]\n[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon: Level 1 -> Level 2]\n[Stat Points Gained: 5]\n[Note: Please try to leave some of the environment for the other players. The janitorial sub-routines are complaining.]\n\nArtie stood there, his arm still raised, the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) trembling in his hand. The 'Prop' was now glowing with a faint, dying ember of gold. \n\n\"I...\" Artie started, his voice a dry rasp. He looked at the smoking crater. He looked at the empty space where a massive tree had been seconds ago. He looked at his own hands. \"I think I might be a little bit broken.\"\n\nHe checked his status bar. \n\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Level: 2]\n\nHe was still one stiff breeze away from a Game Over, but he had just deleted a piece of the world's geometry because he\u2019d gotten lucky. No, not lucky. He\u2019d gotten *math*. \n\n\"Level two,\" he breathed, a hysterical laugh bubbling up in his throat. \"I\u2019m level two. And all it took was the total destruction of a local ecosystem.\"\n\nHe sat down on the edge of the crater, his legs finally giving out. The dirt was still warm. He reached into his pocket, feeling the familiar weight of his dead smartphone and his wallet. They felt like relics from a different reality, a place where slimes didn't exist and trees stayed where you put them.\n\n\"Okay,\" Artie said to the empty forest. \"If that was a level one slime... I really, really need to find some armor that isn't made of 'Prop' material.\"\n\nHe looked at the sword. It was still rusted. It was still a prop. But in his hands, it felt like a detonator. \n\n\"One hit,\" he muttered. \"One hit is all it takes. Now I just have to figure out how to not miss the next five times.\"\n\nThe sun continued to shine, the birds (the ones that hadn't been vaporized) began to chirp again, and Artie Penhaligon, the Level 2 Glass Cannon, began to plan his next move in a world that was clearly not prepared for his arrival.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present_ids\": [\"CHAR_ARTIE\"],\n    \"location\": \"Tutorial Zone\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie defeated a Level 1 Lesser Forest Slime with a 'Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit'.\",\n      \"The crit vaporized the slime and destroyed a massive oak tree, leaving a crater.\",\n      \"Artie leveled up to Level 2.\",\n      \"Artie remains at 1 HP.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"]\n  },\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 4,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\n          \"item\": \"Rusty Shortsword (Prop)\",\n          \"status\": \"carried\",\n          \"container\": \"hand_right\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"item\": \"Smartphone (dead)\",\n          \"status\": \"stowed\",\n          \"container\": \"pockets\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"item\": \"Wallet\",\n          \"status\": \"stowed\",\n          \"container\": \"pockets\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\n          \"container\": \"hand_right\",\n          \"location\": \"arm_right\",\n          \"contents\": [\"Rusty Shortsword (Prop)\"]\n        },\n        {\n          \"container\": \"pockets\",\n          \"location\": \"legs\",\n          \"contents\": [\"Smartphone (dead)\", \"Wallet\"]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie is beginning to realize the sheer scale of his 'Crit' power and the environmental destruction it causes.\",\n        \"Artie is now Level 2 and feels a mix of terror and hysterical triumph.\"\n      ],\n      \"invariants_add\": [\n        \"status: Level 2\",\n        \"milestone: first_kill = DONE\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie was cornered by a Level 1 slime against an oak tree in the Tutorial Zone.\",\n      \"After missing five times due to erratic hit detection, Artie landed a 'Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit' that vaporized the slime and the tree.\",\n      \"The System awarded Artie Level 2 status and warned him about environmental destruction.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Artie missed the slime exactly five times, highlighting the difficulty of his build.\",\n      \"Artie triggered a massive 'Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit' on the sixth attempt.\",\n      \"The resulting explosion vaporized the slime and destroyed the environment (oak tree).\",\n      \"Artie reached Level 2 and gained 5 stat points.\",\n      \"Artie confirmed his 1 HP status remains a constant danger despite his high damage output.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"milestone: artie_death = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: system_entry = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: tutorial_arrival = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: first_kill = DONE\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Rusty Shortsword (Prop) (carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"status: CHAR_ARTIE -> 1/1 HP (hard constraint)\",\n      \"status: CHAR_ARTIE -> 100% Critical Hit Rate (hard constraint)\",\n      \"status: CHAR_ARTIE -> Level 2\",\n      \"location: Tutorial Zone\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Artie defeated his first enemy, a Level 1 slime, using a world-shaking critical hit.\",\n      \"Artie leveled up to Level 2, though his HP remains at 1.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",

You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the RNG-Hellscape\",\"goal\":\"Introduce Artie and his

No recap.\n- Summaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\n- Use the continuity pack and state for continuity.\n- Use character_registry to keep names consistent in prose.\n- Timeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\n- State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\n- Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n- Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\n- Inventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- For held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\n- If a required event is not in the Scene Card, do not perform it.\n- summary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\n- STATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\n- If state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\n- Return prose plus a state_patch JSON block.\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Use cursor_advance only if you need to override the default cursor.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n  - Each entry must include character_id, chapter, scene, inventory (full current list), containers (full current list), invariants_add (array), persona_updates (array).\n  - If you have a single persona update, still wrap it in an array of strings.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger and invariants using standard phrasing, e.g.:\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> shard (carried, container=satchel)\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> longsword (carried, container=hand_right)\n  - container: satchel (owner=CHAR_example, contents=[shard, maps])\n  - milestone: shard_bind = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - milestone: maps_acquired = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - injury: right forearm scar / left arm filament\n  - ownership: shard (carried) / shard (bound but physical)\n\nScene card:\n{\n  \"cast_present\": [\n    \"Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon\"\n  ],\n  \"cast_present_ids\": [\n    \"CHAR_ARTIE\"\n  ],\n  \"chapter\": 1,\n  \"conflict\": \"Artie's 1 HP fragility versus a slow but lethal slime;

intensity of a subwoofer in a teenager\u2019s trunk. I checked the floating red bar hovering above its translucent, jiggly head. \n\n[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 3] [HP: 45/45]\n\nForty-five health. At my current Strength of 12, with a base weapon damage of 4-6, I was looking at a nine-hit kill minimum, assuming the RNG gods didn't decide to spit on my shoes today. \n\n\"You know,\" I said, adjusting my grip on the rusted shortsword. \"In most worlds, puddles are for stepping in, not for getting dissolved by.\"\n\nThe slime responded by launching a glob of corrosive mucus. I rolled left, the grass staining my knees.\n\n[Stamina: 88/100]\n\n\"Missed me. Barely. That\u2019s a three-second cooldown on your spit, isn't it?\"\n\nI didn't wait for the confirmation. I lunged. The blade sank into the gelatinous mass with a sound like a heavy boot pulling out of thick mud.\n\n[Critical Hit! -14 HP]\n\n\"There we go. Who needs luck when you have math?\"\n\nThe slime shuddered, its HP bar dipping into the yellow. \n\n[HP: 31/45]\n\n\"One more of those and we can talk about your retirement plan,\" I muttered. My lungs burned slightly, a reminder that my Agility was still garbage. \n\n[Passive Skill Gained: Basic Analysis (Rank F)]\n[Description: You can see basic stats and cooldowns of enemies within 5 meters. You\u2019ve stopped guessing and started counting. Good for you.]\n\n\"Finally,\" I breathed, dodging another glob. \"The ding is coming. I can practically taste the experience points. They taste like copper and bad decisions.\" \n\nI swung again, the numbers popping in the air like neon confetti. This wasn't just a fight; it was a grind.
