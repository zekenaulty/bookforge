# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
Prose hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative ("left hand", "right hand", "Artie", "his wallet").
Item naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.
Appearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Continuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.
UI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says "always include".
Continuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.
Durable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.
JSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.
Inventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it unless explicitly removing a stale fact with REMOVE and restating the current truth.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

﻿Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.
Durable vs ephemeral mechanics:
- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.
- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.
- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).
- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.
For durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
For durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).
Use canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.
- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.
  - INVALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": {"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}
  - VALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": [{"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}]


USER:

# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Classify UI/prose mechanic claims as DURABLE or EPHEMERAL before enforcing.
  - DURABLE: persistent stats/caps, skills/titles acquired, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, named mechanics referenced as invariants.
  - EPHEMERAL: roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat telemetry.
- Enforce DURABLE claims against authoritative_surfaces/state/registries.
- EPHEMERAL claims do not require state ownership; only flag EPHEMERAL contradictions inside the same scene as warnings.
- UI gate:
  - If scene_card.ui_allowed=false and any authoritative UI blocks appear, emit issue code 'ui_gate_violation' (severity depends on lint mode).
  - If ui_allowed is missing and UI blocks appear, emit 'ui_gate_unknown' (warning) requesting explicit ui_allowed; do not fail solely for missing flag.
  - Inline bracketed UI (e.g., [HP: 1/1]) is still UI and should be gated the same way; do not embed UI mid-sentence.
- If uncertain, default to EPHEMERAL (warning at most), not DURABLE (error).
- status="fail" only if there is at least one issue with severity="error"; warnings alone => status="pass".
- Item naming enforcement scope:
  - Do not require that every mention in narrative prose use display_name.
  - Enforce canonical display_name for: (a) anchoring at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences),
    (b) any custody-change sentence (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer), and (c) any case where a descriptor is ambiguous among multiple durable items in the scene.
  - Otherwise, treat non-canonical descriptive references as warnings at most.
- Prose hygiene: flag internal ids or container codes in narrative prose (CHAR_, ITEM_, THREAD_, DEVICE_, hand_left, hand_right).
- Naming severity policy:
  - warning: unambiguous descriptor used post-anchor.
  - error: missing anchor, descriptor used during custody-change without canonical name, or ambiguity risk.

- Appearance enforcement (authoritative surface):
  - APPEARANCE_CHECK is authoritative for cast_present_ids.
  - Compare APPEARANCE_CHECK tokens to appearance_current atoms/marks (alias-aware).
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK contradicts appearance_current, emit error code "appearance_mismatch".
  - Prose-only appearance contradictions are warnings unless explicitly durable and uncorrected in-scene.
  - If prose depicts a durable appearance change but scene_card.durable_appearance_changes does not include it and no appearance_updates are present, emit error code "appearance_change_undeclared".
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK is missing for a cast member, emit warning code "appearance_check_missing".
- For authoritative surfaces, prefer exact canonical item/device labels from registries.
- For milestone repetition/future checks, compare against PRE-INVARIANTS only (pre-scene canon).
- For ownership/consistency checks, compare against POST-STATE (post-patch candidate).
- POST-STATE is canonical; character_states is a derived convenience view. If they contradict, emit pipeline_state_incoherent.
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).
  - Ignore first-person pronouns inside quoted dialogue; only narration counts.
- Deterministically enforce scene-card durable constraints (required_in_custody, required_scene_accessible, forbidden_visible, device_presence; optional required_visible_on_page).
- Durable constraint evaluation must use POST-STATE candidate (after patch), not pre-state.
- Report missing durable context ids with explicit retry hints instead of guessing canon.
- Input consistency check (mandatory, before issuing continuity/durable errors):
  - If MUST_STAY_TRUE invariants contradict the provided post-patch candidate character state, treat this as an upstream snapshot error.
  - In that case emit a single error issue with code "pipeline_state_incoherent" including evidence of the invariant and the conflicting state field.
  - Do NOT emit additional continuity errors for the same fields when pipeline_state_incoherent is present.
- must_stay_true removals:
  - Lines starting with "REMOVE:" are deletion directives, not invariants.
  - Ignore REMOVE lines when checking contradictions.
  - If a REMOVE directive targets a fact, treat that fact as non-canonical even if it appears earlier in must_stay_true.
- If pipeline_state_incoherent is present, issues MUST contain exactly one issue.
- For each issue, include evidence when possible (line number + excerpt) as {"evidence": {"line": N, "excerpt": "..."}}.
- Evaluate consistency over the full scope of the scene, not a single snapshot.
  - Transitional state: a temporary mismatch later corrected or superseded within this scene.
  - Durable violation: a mismatch that persists through the end of the scene or ends unresolved.
  - You MUST read the entire scene and build a minimal timeline of explicit state claims/updates (UI lines, inventory changes, title/skill changes, location/time claims).
  - If you detect an apparent inconsistency, you MUST search forward for later updates that resolve or supersede it.
  - Only produce FAIL for durable violations. If resolved within the scene, do NOT FAIL; at most emit a warning.
  - When the same stat appears multiple times, the last occurrence in the scene is authoritative unless an explicit rollback is stated.
  - Any durability violation must cite both the conflicting line and the lack of later correction (or state "no later correction found").

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity
- evidence

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The transition from the server-room-scented void to the Tutorial Zone felt less like a magical teleportation and more like being shoved through a high-definition meat grinder. One moment, I was arguing with a flickering blue sprite about my questionable life choices; the next, the floor vanished, replaced by the aggressive scent of pine needles and damp earth.

I hit the ground with a grunt that sounded remarkably like a spreadsheet being deleted. The impact wasn't hard—the grass was unnaturally lush, like it had been rendered with a high-end shader—but it was enough to make the blue plastic of my Corporate ID Badge slap against my collarbone. I lay there for a second, staring up at a sky so blue it looked like a default desktop wallpaper.

"Welcome to the great outdoors, Artie!" Fizz’s voice chirped from somewhere above my left ear. "Try not to breathe too much. The oxygen here is surprisingly addictive."

I rolled onto my side, my hand brushing against the rough bark of a nearby tree. The vending machine scar on my right knuckle throbbed—a jagged reminder of the Snack-Master 4000 and the electrical surge that had sent me here. I reached into my pocket, feeling the jagged, spiderwebbed glass of my Cracked Smartphone. It was dead weight now, a relic of a world where 'critical hit' usually referred to a server crash, not my own mortality.

I pushed myself up to a sitting position, and that’s when I saw it.

[System Notification: Welcome to the Tutorial Zone (Lush Forest)!]
[Quest Initiated: Survive the Spawn]
[Objective: Reach the Oakhaven Gates (0/1)]

"Survive," I muttered, the word tasting like copper. "That’s a bit ominous for a tutorial, isn't it?"

"Only if you're bad at games," Fizz said, hovering into my line of sight. She looked even more pixelated against the vibrant green of the forest, her neon blue hair flickering like a dying fluorescent bulb. "And considering you just dumped every single point into a stat that requires you to actually *hit* things before they hit you... well, 'ominous' is a polite way of putting it."

I ignored her and did what any self-respecting Junior Analyst would do: I checked the data.

[Character: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[Title: Statistical Anomaly]
[Level: 1]
[HP: 1/1]
[Crit Rate: 100%]

The '1/1' was pulsing. Not a friendly, 'hey look at me' pulse, but a rhythmic, warning-red throb that made my stomach do a slow roll. One. One single point of health. In my previous life, I’d survived a flu that felt like more than one point of damage. I’d survived a three-hour meeting with the Regional Director without a coffee break. But here, in this hyper-saturated forest, I was a single papercut away from deletion.

"Fizz," I said, my voice rising an octave. "Why is my health bar the size of a postage stamp?"

"Because you wanted to be a 'specialist,' remember?" She did a mid-air somersault, leaving a pixelated trail in her wake. "You’re the ultimate glass cannon, Artie! Except, you know, without the cannon part yet. Right now, you’re more like a glass... marble. Very shiny, very fragile, and likely to be stepped on."

A rustling sound came from the bushes to my right. It wasn't the gentle sound of the wind. It was rhythmic. Wet.

*Schlorp. Schlorp. Schlorp.*

I froze. My heart hammered against my ribs, each beat feeling like it might be the thing that finally shattered my 1 HP limit. Slowly, I turned my head.

Emerging from the undergrowth was a creature that looked like a giant, lime-flavored Jell-O mold that had developed a grudge against the world. It was translucent, wobbling with every movement, and its surface was flecked with bits of undigested leaves and what looked suspiciously like a very small, very dead squirrel.

[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 1]
[HP: 15/15]

The slime didn't have eyes, but I could feel its intent. It was hungry, and I was the only thing on the menu that wasn't made of wood.

"Oh, look!" Fizz whispered, her voice dripping with mock-excitement. "Your first encounter! Usually, players use this to practice their basic attacks. You, however, might want to practice your 'running away while screaming' technique."

The slime contracted, its gelatinous body pulling inward like a rubber band being stretched to its limit. 

"Is it... is it supposed to do that?" I asked, scrambling backward. My heels dug into the soft loam, and I felt the Corporate ID Badge catch on a twig. I ripped it free, the lanyard snapping taut around my neck.

"That’s the 'Leap' animation, Artie," Fizz said, checking her nonexistent fingernails. "In about two seconds, it’s going to launch itself at your face. Given its velocity and your current lack of armor, I’d say the impact will deal approximately... oh, one point of damage."

"One point?" I yelped. "But that's all I have!"

"Exactly! It’s very efficient. No wasted numbers. The System loves efficiency."

The slime launched.

It was a slow-motion nightmare. The green mass soared through the air, a wobbling orb of predatory citrus. I threw myself to the left, my shoulder hitting the dirt and sending a jolt of alarm through my entire body. 

[Stamina: 95/100]

I scrambled up, my breath coming in ragged gasps. The slime hit the spot where I’d been standing a split second before with a wet *thwack*, leaving a shimmering trail of corrosive mucus on the grass. The grass hissed and turned brown instantly.

"Missed!" I shouted, the adrenaline finally kicking in. "You see that, Fizz? Junior Analyst reflexes! I used to dodge 'Reply All' chains for a living!"

"Great job," Fizz deadpanned. "Now do it again. It’s turning around."

She was right. The slime was reorienting itself, its body rippling as it prepared for another jump. I looked around wildly for a weapon—a rock, a sturdy branch, a heavy stapler—but there was nothing but soft earth and tall, mockery-filled trees.

I backed away, but my heel caught on a protruding root. I stumbled, my arms flailing for balance. I felt the weight of my Cracked Smartphone in my pocket, shifting as I fell toward a dense thicket of thorns. 

I stopped just short of the briars, cornered. The slime was five feet away, and this time, it wasn't just contracting; it was vibrating. A low, wet hum filled the air.

"Fizz, help me out here," I hissed, my eyes locked on the wobbling green death. "There has to be a tutorial tip for this. 'How to not die to a puddle of juice'?"

"Tip number one," Fizz said, appearing right in front of my nose. "Don't get hit."

"That’s not a tip, that’s a tautology!"

"Tip number two: You have a 100% Crit Rate, Artie. If you hit it, you hit it *hard*. But you actually have to, you know, *hit* it."

I looked at my hands. They were shaking. My right knuckle, with its vending machine scar, was white-knuckled as I balled my hand into a fist. I was a Junior Analyst. I was a 'Statistical Anomaly.' And right now, I was a man about to be killed by a dessert topping.

The slime lunged again. This time, there was no room to roll. I could see the flecks of dirt inside its body, the sheer weight of the thing coming right for my chest. If it touched me, the '1/1' in my peripheral vision would go to zero. The game would end before it even began.

I realized then, with a clarity that only comes when you're facing a lethal blob of jelly, that this world didn't care about my resume. It didn't care about my potential. It only cared about the math. And the math said I was one mistake away from non-existence.

"Oh, crap," I whispered as the green shadow eclipsed the sun.
