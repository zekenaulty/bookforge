One moment, Artie was arguing with a flickering blue sprite about his questionable life choices; the next, the floor vanished, replaced by the aggressive scent of pine needles and damp earth.\n\nHe hit the ground with a grunt that sounded remarkably like a spreadsheet being deleted. The impact wasn't hard\u2014the grass was unnaturally lush, like it had been rendered with a high-end shader\u2014but it was enough to make the blue plastic of his Corporate ID Badge slap against his collarbone. Artie lay there for a second, staring up at a sky so blue it looked like a default desktop wallpaper.\n\n\"Welcome to the great outdoors, Artie!\" Fizz\u2019s voice chirped from somewhere above his left ear. \"Try not to breathe too much. The oxygen here is surprisingly addictive.\"\n\nArtie rolled onto his side, his hand brushing against the rough bark of a nearby tree. The vending machine scar on his right knuckle throbbed\u2014a jagged reminder of the Snack-Master 4000 and the electrical surge that had sent him here. He reached into his pocket, feeling the jagged, spiderwebbed glass of his Cracked Smartphone. It was dead weight now, a relic of a world where 'critical hit' usually referred to a server crash, not his own mortality.\n\nHe pushed himself up to a sitting position, and that\u2019s when the world provided its first official greeting.\n\n[System Notification: Welcome to the Tutorial Zone (Lush Forest)!]\n[Quest Initiated: Survive the Spawn]\n[Objective: Reach the Oakhaven Gates (0/1)]\n\n\"Survive,\" Artie muttered, the word tasting like copper. \"That\u2019s a bit ominous for a tutorial, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Only if you're bad at games,\" Fizz said, hovering into his line of sight. She looked even more pixelated against the vibrant green of the forest, her neon blue hair flickering like a dying fluorescent bulb. \"And considering you just dumped every single point into a stat that requires you to actually hit things before they hit you... well, 'ominous' is a polite way of putting it.\"\n\nArtie ignored her and did what any self-respecting Junior Analyst would do: he checked the data.\n\n[Character: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]\n[Title: Statistical Anomaly]\n[Level: 1]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Crit Rate: 100%]\n\nThe '1/1' was pulsing. Not a friendly, 'hey look at me' pulse, but a rhythmic, warning-red throb that made his stomach do a slow roll. One. One single point of health. In his previous life, he\u2019d survived a flu that felt like more than one point of damage. He\u2019d survived a three-hour meeting with the Regional Director without a coffee break. But here, in this hyper-saturated forest, he was a single papercut away from deletion.\n\n\"Fizz,\" Artie said, his voice rising an octave. \"Why is my health bar the size of a postage stamp?\"\n\n\"Because you wanted to be a 'specialist,' remember?\" She did a mid-air somersault, leaving a pixelated trail in her wake. \"You\u2019re the ultimate glass cannon, Artie! Except, you know, without the cannon part yet. Right now, you\u2019re more like a glass... marble. Very shiny, very fragile, and likely to be stepped on.\"\n\nA rustling sound came from the bushes to his right. It wasn't the gentle sound of the wind. It was rhythmic. Wet.\n\nSchlorp. Schlorp. Schlorp.\n\nArtie froze. His heart hammered against his ribs, each beat feeling like it might be the thing that finally shattered his 1 HP limit. Slowly, he turned his head.\n\nEmerging from the undergrowth was a creature that looked like a giant, lime-flavored Jell-O mold that had developed a grudge against the world. It was translucent, wobbling with every movement, and its surface was flecked with bits of undigested leaves and what looked suspiciously like a very small, very dead squirrel.\n\n[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 1]\n[HP: 15/15]\n\nThe slime didn't have eyes, but Artie could feel its intent. It was hungry, and he was the only thing on the menu that wasn't made of wood.\n\n\"Oh, look!\" Fizz whispered, her voice dripping with mock-excitement. \"Your first encounter! Usually, players use this to practice their basic attacks. You, however, might want to practice your 'running away while screaming' technique.\"\n\nThe slime contracted, its gelatinous body pulling inward like a rubber band being stretched to its limit. \n\n\"Is it... is it supposed to do that?\" Artie asked, scrambling backward. His heels dug into the soft loam, and he felt the Corporate ID Badge catch on a twig. He ripped it free, the lanyard snapping taut around his neck.\n\n\"That\u2019s the 'Leap' animation, Artie,\" Fizz said, checking her nonexistent fingernails. \"In about two seconds, it\u2019s going to launch itself at your face. Given its velocity and your current lack of armor, I\u2019d say the impact will deal approximately... oh, one point of damage.\"\n\n\"One point?\" Artie yelped. \"But that's all I have!\"\n\n\"Exactly! It\u2019s very efficient. No wasted numbers. The System loves efficiency.\"\n\nThe slime launched.\n\nIt was a slow-motion nightmare. The green mass soared through the air, a wobbling orb of predatory citrus. Artie threw himself to the left, his shoulder hitting the dirt and sending a jolt of alarm through his entire body. \n\n[Stamina: 95/100]\n\nHe scrambled up, his breath coming in ragged gasps. The slime hit the spot where he\u2019d been standing a split second before with a wet thwack, leaving a shimmering trail of corrosive mucus on the grass. The grass hissed and turned brown instantly.\n\n\"Missed!\" Artie shouted, the adrenaline finally kicking in. \"You see that, Fizz? Junior Analyst reflexes! I used to dodge 'Reply All' chains for a living!\"\n\n\"Great job,\" Fizz deadpanned. \"Now do it again. It\u2019s turning around.\"\n\nShe was right. The slime was reorienting itself, its body rippling as it prepared for another jump. Artie looked around wildly for a weapon\u2014a rock, a sturdy branch, a heavy stapler\u2014but there was nothing but soft earth and tall, mockery-filled trees.\n\nHe backed away, but his heel caught on a protruding root. He stumbled, his arms flailing for balance. He felt the weight of his Cracked Smartphone in his pocket, shifting as he fell toward a dense thicket of thorns. \n\nHe stopped just short of the briars, cornered. The slime was five feet away, and this time, it wasn't just contracting; it was vibrating. A low, wet hum filled the air.\n\n\"Fizz, help me out here,\" Artie hissed, his eyes locked on the wobbling green death. \"There has to be a tutorial tip for this. 'How to not die to a puddle of juice'?\"\n\n\"Tip number one,\" Fizz said, appearing right in front of his nose. \"Don't get hit.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s not a tip, that\u2019s a tautology!\"\n\n\"Tip number two: You have a 100% Crit Rate, Artie. If you hit it, you hit it hard. But you actually have to, you know, hit it.\"\n\nArtie looked at his hands. They were shaking. His right knuckle, with its vending machine scar, was white-knuckled as he balled his hand into a fist. He was a Junior Analyst. He was a 'Statistical Anomaly.' And right now, he was a man about to be killed by a dessert topping.\n\nThe slime lunged again. This time, there was no room to roll. Artie could see the flecks of dirt inside its body, the sheer weight of the thing coming right for his chest. If it touched me, the '1/1' in his peripheral vision would go to zero. The game would end before it even began.\n\nHe realized then, with a clarity that only comes when you're facing a lethal blob of jelly, that this world didn't care about his resume. It didn't care about his potential. It only cared about the math. And the math said he was one mistake away from non-existence.\n\n\"Oh, crap,\" Artie whispered as the green shadow eclipsed the sun.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"CHAR_FIZZ\"],\n    \"location\": \"Tutorial Zone (Lush Forest)\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie arrived in the Lush Forest tutorial zone.\",\n      \"Artie encountered a Level 1 Lesser Puddle Slime.\",\n      \"Artie realized that 1 HP means any hit is fatal.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"]\n  },\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie arrived in the Lush Forest tutorial zone and was immediately confronted by the reality of his 1 HP build.\",\n      \"A Lesser Puddle Slime attacked, forcing Artie to realize that he must dodge every single attack to survive.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Artie spawns in the Lush Forest with his Corporate ID Badge and Cracked Smartphone.\",\n      \"The System initiates the 'Survive the Spawn' quest.\",\n      \"Artie confirms his stats: Level 1, 1/1 HP, and 100% Crit Rate.\",\n      \"A Lesser Puddle Slime (Lvl 1) aggros on Artie.\",\n      \"Artie successfully dodges the slime's first leap, consuming 5 stamina.\",\n      \"Artie is cornered against a thicket of thorns as the slime prepares a second lunge.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"milestone: artie_electrocuted = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: crit_build_finalized = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: survive_the_spawn_initiated = DONE\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Corporate ID Badge (status=equipped, container=neck)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Cracked Smartphone (status=stowed, container=pocket_right)\",\n      \"container: neck (owner=CHAR_ARTIE, contents=[Corporate ID Badge])\",\n      \"container: pocket_right (owner=CHAR_ARTIE, contents=[Cracked Smartphone])\",\n      \"injury: vending machine scar on right knuckle\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Artie has entered the game world and faced his first lethal threat, establishing the high stakes of his glitchy build.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 3,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\"item\": \"ITEM_ID_BADGE\", \"container\": \"neck\", \"status\": \"equipped\"},\n        {\"item\": \"ITEM_SMARTPHONE\", \"container\": \"pocket_right\", \"status\": \"stowed\"}\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\"container\": \"neck\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_ID_BADGE\"]},\n        {\"container\": \"pocket_right\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_SMARTPHONE\"]}\n      ],\n      \"invariants_add\": [\n        \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Corporate ID Badge (status=equipped, container=neck)\",\n        \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Cracked Smartphone (status=stowed, container=pocket_right)\"\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie is beginning to understand that his 'Statistical Anomaly' title is a literal warning of his fragility.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"character_continuity_system_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"set\": {\n        \"stats\": {\n          \"level\": 1,\n          \"hp\": {\"current\": 1, \"max\": 1},\n          \"crit_rate\": 100,\n          \"stamina\": {\"current\": 95, \"max\": 100}\n        },\n        \"titles\": [\n          {\"name\": \"Statistical Anomaly\", \"source\": \"system_glitch\", \"active\": true}\n        ]\n      },\n      \"reason\": \"Establishing base level and tracking stamina consumption after first dodge.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"inventory_alignment_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"set\": {\n        \"inventory\": [\n          {\"item\": \"ITEM_ID_BADGE\", \"container\": \"neck\", \"status\": \"equipped\"},\n          {\"item\": \"ITEM_SMARTPHONE\", \"container\": \"pocket_right\", \"status\": \"stowed\"}\n        ],\n        \"containers\": [\n          {\"container\": \"neck\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_ID_BADGE\"]},\n          {\"container\": \"pocket_right\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_SMARTPHONE\"]}\n        ]\n      },\n      \"reason\": \"Normalization of inventory posture upon arrival in the tutorial zone.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"set\": {\n        \"world_type\": \"tutorial_zone\",\n        \"reality_stability\": 45\n      },\n      \"reason\": \"Confirmed arrival in the Lush Forest tutorial instance.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nUI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says \"always include\".\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it unless explicitly removing a stale fact with REMOVE and restating the current truth.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v2\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\n\ufeffOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\":

        "content": "# REPAIR\n\nFix the scene based on lint issues.\nSummaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\nTimeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: pre-scene invariants and summary facts are binding unless the Scene Card depicts a change. If this scene changes a durable fact, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value and remove the old entry.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n- must_stay_true removal (mandatory when a durable fact is superseded):\n  - Add \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" in summary_update.must_stay_true.\n  - Place REMOVE lines before the new final invariant.\n  - REMOVE lines also apply to key_facts_ring (purge stale facts from continuity).\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- Inventory posture reconciliation:\n  - If inventory/containers change (held/stowed/container), must_stay_true must be updated to the final posture.\n  - Add REMOVE lines for prior inventory/container invariants before the new final entries.\n  - Use canonical invariant formats:\n    - inventory: CHAR_X -> <item display_name> (status=held|carried|equipped|stowed, container=hand_left|hand_right|<container>)\n    - container: <container> (owner=CHAR_X, contents=[<item display_name>, ...])\nFor held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\nContinuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.\n- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.\n- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.\n- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI gate: only include bracketed UI blocks when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If false, remove or rephrase UI blocks into narrative prose.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or a short parenthetical annotation (e.g., (locked), (Warning: ...)).\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nCanonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\nIf item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for authoritative labels and custody terms.\nUse item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If a durable appearance change occurs in this scene, record it in character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- APPEARANCE_CHECK is required in COMPLIANCE for each cast_present_id (4-8 tokens from atoms/marks).\n\nNaming repairs:\n- If lint flags an item naming issue, fix it with minimal edits.\n- Do not remove humor; simply anchor the item (add display_name near first mention) and ensure custody-change sentences include the display_name.\n- Do not rename item_id or registry fields; only adjust prose wording.\nsummary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\nSTATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nmust_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nIf state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nEnforce scene-card durable constraints: `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\nRespect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`.\n- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):\n  - If timeline_scope != \"present\" OR ontological_scope != \"real\", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).\n  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.\n  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category=\"timeline_override\".\nReturn corrected prose plus a corrected state_patch JSON block.\n\nOutput format (required, no code fences, no commentary):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n\nAPPEARANCE_CHECK:\n- CHAR_ID: <4-8 tokens from atoms/marks>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects.

Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_device_id, replacement_of.\n  - custodian must be a non-null string id/scope (character id or \"world\"). Never use null.\n    - INVALID: \"custodian\": null\n    - VALID: \"custodian\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\" or \"world\"\n  - owner_scope must be \"character\" or \"world\" and must match the custodian scope.\n  - plot_device_updates: set must include name, custody_scope, custody_ref, activation_state, linked_threads, constraints, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n- Transfer vs registry conflict rule (must follow):\n  - If you create a NEW item in item_registry_updates with final custodian already set (e.g., CHAR_ARTIE), DO NOT emit transfer_updates for that item.\n  - If you emit transfer_updates for a NEW item, the registry entry must start with custodian=\"world\" and then transfer to the character.\n  - expected_before must match the registry

`updates` field.\n  - inventory_alignment_updates[*].set MUST be an object (not a list).\n    - INVALID: \"set\": []\n    - VALID:   \"set\": {\"inventory\": [...], \"containers\": [...]}\n- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.\n- If you mutate durable state, do not leave the same mutation only in prose.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n- appearance_updates: when a durable appearance change happens, include appearance_updates on the relevant character_updates entry.\n  - appearance_updates MUST be an object, not an array.\n    - INVALID: \"appearance_updates\": [{\"set\": {...}, \"reason\": \"...\"}]\n    - VALID: \"appearance_updates\": {\"set\": {\"marks_add\": [{\"name\": \"Singed Hair\", \"location\": \"head\", \"durability\": \"durable\"}]}, \"reason\": \"...\"}\n  - appearance_updates.set may include atoms and marks only (canonical truth).\n    - Do NOT put marks_add at the top level; it belongs under set.\n    - Use set.marks_add / set.marks_remove for marks changes.\n    - Use set.atoms for atom changes.\n  - appearance_updates.reason is required (brief, factual).\n  -

teleportation and more like being shoved through a high-definition meat grinder. One moment, I was arguing with a flickering blue sprite about my questionable life choices; the next, the floor vanished, replaced by the aggressive scent of pine needles and damp earth.\n\nI hit the ground with a grunt that sounded remarkably like a spreadsheet being deleted. The impact wasn't hard\u2014the grass was unnaturally lush, like it had been rendered with a high-end shader\u2014but it was enough to make the blue plastic of my Corporate ID Badge slap against my collarbone. I lay there for a second, staring up at a sky so blue it looked like a default desktop wallpaper.\n\n\"Welcome to the great outdoors, Artie!\" Fizz\u2019s voice chirped from somewhere above my left ear. \"Try not to breathe too much. The oxygen here is surprisingly addictive.\"\n\nI rolled onto my side, my hand brushing against the rough bark of a nearby tree. The vending machine scar on my right knuckle throbbed\u2014a jagged reminder of the Snack-Master 4000 and the electrical surge that had sent me here. I reached into my pocket, feeling the jagged, spiderwebbed glass of my Cracked Smartphone. It was dead weight now, a relic of a world where 'critical hit' usually referred to a server crash, not my own mortality.\n\nI pushed myself up to a sitting position, and that\u2019s when I saw it.\n\n[System Notification: Welcome to the Tutorial Zone (Lush Forest)!]\n[Quest Initiated: Survive the Spawn]\n[Objective: Reach the Oakhaven Gates (0/1)]\n\n\"Survive,\" I muttered, the word tasting like copper. \"That\u2019s a bit ominous for a tutorial, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Only if you're bad at games,\" Fizz said, hovering into my line of sight. She looked even more pixelated against the vibrant green of the forest, her neon blue hair flickering like a dying fluorescent bulb. \"And considering you just dumped every single point into a stat that requires you to actually *hit* things before they hit you... well, 'ominous' is a polite way of putting it.\"\n\nI ignored her and did what any self-respecting Junior Analyst would do: I checked the data.\n\n[Character: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]\n[Title: Statistical Anomaly]\n[Level: 1]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Crit Rate: 100%]\n\nThe '1/1' was pulsing. Not a friendly, 'hey look at me' pulse, but a rhythmic, warning-red throb that made my stomach do a slow roll. One. One single point of health. In my previous life, I\u2019d survived a flu that felt like more than one point of damage. I\u2019d survived a three-hour meeting with the Regional Director without a coffee break. But here, in this hyper-saturated forest, I was a single papercut away from deletion.\n\n\"Fizz,\" I said, my voice rising an octave. \"Why is my health bar the size of a postage stamp?\"\n\n\"Because you wanted to be a 'specialist,' remember?\" She did a mid-air somersault, leaving a pixelated trail in her wake. \"You\u2019re the ultimate glass cannon, Artie! Except, you know, without the cannon part yet. Right now, you\u2019re more like a glass... marble. Very shiny, very fragile, and likely to be stepped on.\"\n\nA rustling sound came from the bushes to my right. It wasn't the gentle sound of the wind. It was rhythmic. Wet.\n\n*Schlorp. Schlorp. Schlorp.*\n\nI froze. My heart hammered against my ribs, each beat feeling like it might be the thing that finally shattered my 1 HP limit. Slowly, I turned my head.\n\nEmerging from the undergrowth was a creature that looked like a giant, lime-flavored Jell-O mold that had developed a grudge against the world. It was translucent, wobbling with every movement, and its surface was flecked with bits of undigested leaves and what looked suspiciously like a very small, very dead squirrel.\n\n[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 1]\n[HP: 15/15]\n\nThe slime didn't have eyes, but I could feel its intent. It was hungry, and I was the only thing on the menu that wasn't made of wood.\n\n\"Oh, look!\" Fizz whispered, her voice dripping with mock-excitement. \"Your first encounter! Usually, players use this to practice their basic attacks. You, however, might want to practice your 'running away while screaming' technique.\"\n\nThe slime contracted, its gelatinous body pulling inward like a rubber band being stretched to its limit. \n\n\"Is it... is it supposed to do that?\" I asked, scrambling backward. My heels dug into the soft loam, and I felt the Corporate ID Badge catch on a twig. I ripped it free, the lanyard snapping taut around my neck.\n\n\"That\u2019s the 'Leap' animation, Artie,\" Fizz said, checking her nonexistent fingernails. \"In about two seconds, it\u2019s going to launch itself at your face. Given its velocity and your current lack of armor, I\u2019d say the impact will deal approximately... oh, one point of damage.\"\n\n\"One point?\" I yelped. \"But that's all I have!\"\n\n\"Exactly! It\u2019s very efficient. No wasted numbers. The System loves efficiency.\"\n\nThe slime launched.\n\nIt was a slow-motion nightmare. The green mass soared through the air, a wobbling orb of predatory citrus. I threw myself to the left, my shoulder hitting the dirt and sending a jolt of alarm through my entire body. \n\n[Stamina: 95/100]\n\nI scrambled up, my breath coming in ragged gasps. The slime hit the spot where I\u2019d been standing a split second before with a wet *thwack*, leaving a shimmering trail of corrosive mucus on the grass. The grass hissed and turned brown instantly.\n\n\"Missed!\" I shouted, the adrenaline finally kicking in. \"You see that, Fizz? Junior Analyst reflexes! I used to dodge 'Reply All' chains for a living!\"\n\n\"Great job,\" Fizz deadpanned. \"Now do it again. It\u2019s turning around.\"\n\nShe was right. The slime was reorienting itself, its body rippling as it prepared for another jump. I looked around wildly for a weapon\u2014a rock, a sturdy branch, a heavy stapler\u2014but there was nothing but soft earth and tall, mockery-filled trees.\n\nI backed away, but my heel caught on a protruding root. I stumbled, my arms flailing for balance. I felt the weight of my Cracked Smartphone in my pocket, shifting as I fell toward a dense thicket of thorns. \n\nI stopped just short of the briars, cornered. The slime was five feet away, and this time, it wasn't just contracting; it was vibrating. A low, wet hum filled the air.\n\n\"Fizz, help me out here,\" I hissed, my eyes locked on the wobbling green death. \"There has to be a tutorial tip for this. 'How to not die to a puddle of juice'?\"\n\n\"Tip number one,\" Fizz said, appearing right in front of my nose. \"Don't get hit.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s not a tip, that\u2019s a tautology!\"\n\n\"Tip number two: You have a 100% Crit Rate, Artie. If you hit it, you hit it *hard*. But you actually have to, you know, *hit* it.\"\n\nI looked at my hands. They were shaking. My right knuckle, with its vending machine scar, was white-knuckled as I balled my hand into a fist. I was a Junior Analyst. I was a 'Statistical Anomaly.' And right now, I was a man about to be killed by a dessert topping.\n\nThe slime lunged again. This time, there was no room to roll. I could see the flecks of dirt inside its body, the sheer weight of the thing coming right for my chest. If it touched me, the '1/1' in my peripheral vision would go to zero. The game would end before it even began.\n\nI realized then, with a clarity that only comes when you're facing a lethal blob of jelly, that this world didn't care about my resume. It didn't care about my potential. It only cared about the math. And the math said I was one mistake away from non-existence.\n\n\"Oh, crap,\" I whispered as the green shadow eclipsed the sun.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n
