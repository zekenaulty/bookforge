The fluorescent lights of the office breakroom hummed with a low-frequency dread that resonated perfectly with the dull ache in Artie\u2019s lower back\u2014a gift from eight hours of sitting in a chair designed by someone who clearly hated human anatomy. He was a Junior Data Analyst, which was corporate-speak for \"the guy who fixes the pivot tables when the seniors break them.\" His life was a series of cells and rows, a spreadsheet that never quite balanced, and right now, the only thing that could make the next two hours of data entry bearable was a bag of Extreme Nacho-Flavored Dust-Rings.\n\nHe fed the Crumpled Dollar Bill into the machine\u2019s hungry, glowing maw. The bill was a tragic thing, limp and creased from being forgotten in his pocket through three wash cycles. The machine took it halfway, hummed with mechanical judgment, and then spat it back out with a sound like a disappointed sigh.\n\n\"Come on, you bucket of bolts,\" Artie muttered. He adjusted his Corporate ID Badge, which was tangled in its lanyard and currently tickling his collarbone. He smoothed the dollar again, this time using the plastic edge of his badge to iron out the stubborn crease across George Washington\u2019s nose. \n\nHe was slender, perhaps a bit too pale from a lack of sunlight, and his mousy brown hair was currently standing up in a small tuft at the back of his head\u2014a physical manifestation of his rising blood pressure. He looked at the machine. The machine looked back, its glass front reflecting his perpetually tired hazel eyes.\n\nHe tried again. The dollar went in. The machine groaned. It churned. \n\n*Accepted.*\n\nArtie exhaled a breath he hadn't realized he was holding. He pressed the buttons: B-4. The coil began to rotate. The Extreme Nacho-Flavored Dust-Rings shifted. They leaned forward. They reached the precipice of the metal spiral. And then, with the malicious precision of a scripted event, the bag snagged. It dangled there, suspended by a single plastic corner, mocking the laws of gravity and Artie\u2019s very existence.\n\n\"You have got to be kidding me,\" Artie whispered. \n\nHe looked around the breakroom. It was empty, save for a half-empty pot of lukewarm coffee that smelled like burnt rubber. This was a test. The universe was checking to see if he had a breaking point. \n\nArtie didn't just have a breaking point; he had a specialized technique for it. Over the last three years, he had developed a very specific set of skills. They weren't the kind of skills that got you a raise, but they were the kind that got you snacks. \n\nHe stepped forward and placed his hands on the sides of the Snack-O-Matic 3000. He planted his feet, shifting his weight to his heels. This was the opening move of his aggressive vending machine shaking. It wasn't about brute strength\u2014Artie\u2019s Strength was, at best, a rounding error. It was about resonance. It was about finding the frequency of the machine and disrupting it.\n\nHe gave the machine a sharp, rhythmic shove. *Thump-thump.* The glass rattled. The bag of chips danced, but the snag held.\n\n\"Give. Me. My. Rings,\" Artie grunted, his voice rising with every word. \n\nHe increased the intensity. He wasn't just shaking a machine anymore; he was shaking the entire corporate structure that kept him chained to a desk. He was shaking the spreadsheets, the meetings that could have been emails, and the fact that he was twenty-eight and his biggest achievement of the week was finding a shortcut for a VLOOKUP formula.\n\nThe machine rocked on its base. Inside, the coil vibrated. The bag of chips slipped a millimeter. \n\nArtie lunged in for the finisher. He put his shoulder into the frame and gave it a violent, twisting heave. It was a move he\u2019d perfected over dozens of failed snack-drops, a masterpiece of kinetic frustration.\n\nSomething inside the machine clicked. Not the satisfying click of a falling bag, but a sharp, metallic *crack*. \n\nA spark jumped behind the glass. The hum of the fluorescent lights suddenly intensified, rising to a piercing whine. Artie felt a strange tingling in his fingertips, a static charge that made the hair on his arms stand up. He should have let go. Any sane person would have stepped back. But the Extreme Nacho-Flavored Dust-Rings were so close. They were right there.\n\n\"Just... one... more!\"\n\nAs he delivered the final, most aggressive shake of his career, the Snack-O-Matic 3000 decided it had had enough of Artie\u2019s resonance. A massive electrical surge, triggered by a frayed wire and Artie\u2019s own stubbornness, tore through the machine\u2019s internal circuitry. \n\nBlue light erupted from the coin slot. \n\nArtie didn't even have time to scream. The current slammed into his chest, throwing his heart out of rhythm and locking his muscles in a jagged, agonizing spasm. His vision didn't just go blurry; it shattered into a million white pixels. \n\nThe last thing he felt wasn't pain, but a profound sense of irony. He was dying for a bag of chips that cost a dollar he\u2019d had to iron with his ID badge. \n\nThe breakroom, the humming lights, and the smell of burnt coffee vanished. \n\nThe world cut to black.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_ARTIE\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"Office Breakroom\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie attempted to buy snacks from a vending machine.\",\n      \"The vending machine malfunctioned, trapping Artie's chips.\",\n      \"Artie used his aggressive vending machine shaking skill.\",\n      \"A massive electrical surge from the machine electrocuted Artie.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\",\n      \"THREAD_VANE_RIVALRY\",\n      \"THREAD_SYSTEM_GLITCH\",\n      \"THREAD_THE_ASCENSION\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\n          \"item_id\": \"ITEM_OFFICE_ID\",\n          \"container\": \"lanyard\",\n          \"status\": \"equipped\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"item_id\": \"ITEM_SMARTPHONE\",\n          \"container\": \"pocket_left\",\n          \"status\": \"stowed\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"item_id\": \"ITEM_WALLET\",\n          \"container\": \"pocket_right\",\n          \"status\": \"stowed\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\n          \"container\": \"pocket_left\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n          \"contents\": [\n            \"ITEM_SMARTPHONE\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"container\": \"pocket_right\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n          \"contents\": [\n            \"ITEM_WALLET\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"container\": \"lanyard\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n          \"contents\": [\n            \"ITEM_OFFICE_ID\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie's mundane life has ended in a freak accident.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"character_continuity_system_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"set\": {\n        \"stats\": {\n          \"hp\": {\n            \"current\": 0,\n            \"max\": 10\n          }\n        },\n        \"statuses\": [\n          \"Deceased (Mundane)\"\n        ]\n      },\n      \"reason\": \"Artie was electrocuted to death by a vending machine.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"item_registry_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"item_id\": \"ITEM_CRUMPLED_DOLLAR\",\n      \"set\": {\n        \"custodian\": \"world\",\n        \"state_tags\": [\n          \"stowed\",\n          \"vending_machine\"\n        ]\n      },\n      \"reason\": \"The dollar bill was accepted by the vending machine before Artie's death.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"transfer_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"item_id\": \"ITEM_CRUMPLED_DOLLAR\",\n      \"reason\": \"Artie fed the dollar into the vending machine.\",\n      \"source\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"destination\": \"world\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"inventory_alignment_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"remove\": [\n        {\n          \"item_id\": \"ITEM_CRUMPLED_DOLLAR\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"reason\": \"Dollar is no longer in Artie's possession.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie struggled with a vending machine in his office breakroom over a bag of chips.\",\n      \"After his dollar was accepted but the chips remained stuck, he attempted to shake the machine.\",\n      \"The machine short-circuited, electrocuting Artie and ending his life in the mundane world.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Artie used his 'Aggressive Vending Machine Shaking' skill on the Snack-O-Matic 3000.\",\n      \"The vending machine suffered a critical electrical failure.\",\n      \"Artie was electrocuted and died, triggering the transition to the System world.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"REMOVE: inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Crumpled Dollar Bill (status=carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"milestone: artie_electrocution = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: artie_death = DONE\",\n      \"inventory: world -> Crumpled Dollar Bill (status=stowed, container=vending_machine)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Corporate ID Badge (status=equipped, container=lanyard)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Smartphone (status=stowed, container=pocket_left)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Leather Wallet (status=stowed, container=pocket_right)\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Artie's mundane life as a Junior Data Analyst ended abruptly in a breakroom accident.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",

You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nUI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says \"always include\".\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true. If a prior invariant is stale or superseded, you MUST flag it for removal using \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" before restating the current truth.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v2\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}]\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the

        "content": "# WRITE\nWrite the scene described by the scene card.\n- YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN PROSE AND THE STATE_PATCH.\n- Start in motion. No recap.\n- Summaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\n- Use the continuity pack and state for continuity.\n- Use character_registry to keep names consistent in prose.\n- Timeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\n- State primacy: pre-scene invariants and summary facts are binding unless the Scene Card depicts a change. If this scene changes a durable fact, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value and remove the old entry.\n- Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n\n- must_stay_true is end-of-scene truth only (last occurrence wins); do not keep earlier values that are superseded by the scene.\n\n- must_stay_true removal (mandatory when a durable fact is superseded):\n  - Add \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" in summary_update.must_stay_true.\n  - Place REMOVE lines before the new final invariant.\n  - REMOVE lines also apply to key_facts_ring (purge stale facts from continuity).\n\n- Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\n- Inventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- Inventory posture reconciliation:\n  - If inventory/containers change (held/stowed/container), must_stay_true must be updated to the final posture.\n  - Add REMOVE lines for prior inventory/container invariants before the new final entries.\n  - Use canonical invariant formats:\n    - inventory: CHAR_X -> <item display_name> (status=held|carried|equipped|stowed, container=hand_left|hand_right|<container>)\n    - container: <container> (owner=CHAR_X, contents=[<item display_name>, ...])\n\n- For held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\n- Continuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.\n- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.\n- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.\n- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI gate: only include bracketed UI blocks when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If false, do not include UI blocks; rephrase into narrative prose.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or a short parenthetical annotation (e.g., (locked), (Warning: ...)).\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\n- titles are arrays of objects with stable name fields; do not emit titles as plain strings.\n- If item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for ownership/custody labels in authoritative outputs.\n- Use item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If a durable appearance change occurs in this scene, record it in character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- APPEARANCE_CHECK is required in COMPLIANCE for each cast_present_id (4-8 tokens from atoms/marks).\n\nDurable item naming discipline:\n- When you first describe a durable item, anchor it by using the canonical display_name within the same paragraph (or within the next 2 sentences).\n- After anchoring, you may use brief descriptors for style if unambiguous.\n- During any custody/handling change, include the canonical display_name in that sentence.\n- If a required event is not in the Scene Card, do not perform it.\n- Enforce scene-card durable constraints: honor `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, and `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\n- Respect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope` when proposing durable mutations; do not mutate physical custody in non-present/non-real scope unless explicitly marked override.\n\n- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):\n  - If timeline_scope != \"present\" OR ontological_scope != \"real\", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).\n  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.\n  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category=\"timeline_override\".\n\n- summary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\n- STATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\n\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\n\n- If state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\n\n- Return prose plus a state_patch JSON block.\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects.

Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_device_id, replacement_of.\n  - custodian must be a non-null string id/scope (character id or \"world\"). Never use null.\n    - INVALID: \"custodian\": null\n    - VALID: \"custodian\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\" or \"world\"\n  - owner_scope must be \"character\" or \"world\" and must match the custodian scope.\n  - plot_device_updates: set must include name, custody_scope, custody_ref, activation_state, linked_threads, constraints, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n\n- Transfer vs registry conflict rule (must follow):\n  - If you create a NEW item in item_registry_updates with final custodian already set (e.g., CHAR_ARTIE), DO NOT emit transfer_updates for that item.\n  - If you emit transfer_updates for a NEW item, the registry entry must start with custodian=\"world\" and then transfer to the character.\n  - expected_before must match the registry entry at the moment of transfer (after any registry update that applies before it).  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects;

I checked the floating red bar hovering above its translucent, jiggly head. \n\n[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 3] [HP: 45/45]\n\nForty-five health. At my current Strength of 12, with a base weapon damage of 4-6, I was looking at a nine-hit kill minimum, assuming the RNG gods didn't decide to spit on my shoes today. \n\n\"You know,\" I said, adjusting my grip on the rusted shortsword. \"In most worlds, puddles are for stepping in, not for getting dissolved by.\"\n\nThe slime responded by launching a glob of corrosive mucus. I rolled left, the grass staining my knees.\n\n[Stamina: 88/100]\n\n\"Missed me. Barely. That\u2019s a three-second cooldown on your spit, isn't it?\"\n\nI didn't wait for the confirmation. I lunged.
