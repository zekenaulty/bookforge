  "text": "PROSE:\nThe shelf of vitrified silt was a cold, indifferent host. Kaelen lay where he had collapsed, his chest heaving in shallow, ragged bursts that tasted of scorched copper and the sharp, ozone-heavy scent of a lightning strike. Each inhalation was a penance. It wasn't just the altitude of the High Spire\u2019s foothills that thinned the oxygen; it was the way the star-shard in his satchel seemed to consume the very atmosphere around it.\n\nHis right arm lay across his lap, a heavy, useless thing of waxy flesh and mottled purple bruising. The frost-burn, a brutal souvenir of the Oath\u2019s fracture and the subsequent discharge at the crater\u2019s floor, had turned the limb into a numbing anchor. The skin was translucent in the dying violet light of the valley, stretched tight over the radius bone where the Starwrought Oath resided. \n\nHe could feel the pewter filament. It was no longer a smooth, supportive conduit within his marrow. The discharge had turned the metal brittle, and now, with every labored breath, he felt the sickening, microscopic grind of metal against bone\u2014a dry clicking that vibrated up into his shoulder. The Oath was a physical splinter, a holy tether to a celestial order that was currently poisoning his blood.\n\nA rhythmic sound pulsed from the leather satchel at his hip. \n\nThump-hiss.\n\nIt was the heartbeat of a dying sun, a heavy, concussive vibration that hit the back of Kaelen\u2019s teeth, followed by a sibilant leak of energy that made the fine hairs on his neck stand on end. The satchel jerked against his thigh. The shard was waking up, its alien resonance seeking a host to stabilize its own collapsing essence. If he didn't contain it, the pulse would grow until it shattered the container\u2014and Kaelen\u2019s remaining sanity along with it.\n\nHe reached out with his left hand, his fingers trembling. The movement was slow, deliberate. He unbuckled the strap. The thump-hiss grew louder, more insistent. A plume of pale violet vapor escaped the bag, smelling of old graves and cold iron.\n\nKaelen gritted his teeth, the metallic tang in his mouth intensifying until he felt he was sucking on a lead coin. He reached into the satchel and closed his hand around the shard.\n\nThe world vanished.\n\nIt wasn't just the agony of the vacuum pulling the warmth from his marrow. As his skin met the glass-like surface of the shard, Kaelen\u2019s mind was forcibly expanded into the void. He saw it: a galaxy of guttering candles, stars winking out one by one into a suffocating, velvet dark. In the center of the collapse, a shape that was not a shape loomed\u2014a cosmic beast with eyes like dying suns, its many-limbed shadow reaching across the firmament to pull the light from the sky. It was a predator of constellations, and it was looking back at him through the shard.\n\nKaelen\u2019s lungs seized, the air in his windpipe turning to shards of ice. He couldn't scream; there was no breath left to carry the sound. He forced his eyes to stay open, fighting the vision of the beast, focusing instead on the physical bridge he had to build.\n\nThe pewter filament in his radius bone began to glow, not with the steady, silver light of the High Spire, but with a frantic, stuttering violet. The metal was reacting to the shard\u2019s proximity, the two forces\u2014the ancient Oath and the fallen star\u2014grinding together like tectonic plates. Kaelen\u2019s vision blurred, the edges of the world fraying into grey static. \n\nHe focused on the center of his wrist, where the waxy skin was beginning to smoke. He had to bridge the gap. He had to offer the shard a path into the Oath. \n\nWith a guttural, wordless grunt of effort, Kaelen pushed his remaining Oath-essence into the fractured metal. He visualized the filament not as a broken wire, but as a starving root. He commanded the pewter to reach out, to drink from the shard's necrotic pulse. \n\nThe thump-hiss changed. The thump became a hammer blow against his soul, and the hiss became a roar in his ears. The violet light flared, blindingly bright, illuminating the veins in his arm like a map of a shattered kingdom. The pewter filament groaned\u2014a physical sound, a metallic shriek muffled by muscle and skin. Kaelen felt the metal heat up, the friction of the binding melting the ice of the frost-burn from the inside out. \n\nIt was a different kind of pain. The numbness was replaced by a searing, liquid fire that followed the line of the Oath from his wrist to his elbow. He watched, fascinated and horrified, as the waxy discoloration of his skin began to recede, replaced by a network of thin, black lines that traced the path of the new corruption. The shard wasn't being contained; it was being integrated.\n\nThe resonance began to slow. \n\nThump... hiss.\n\nThump... hiss.\n\nKaelen\u2019s own heart, laboring in his chest, began to stutter, trying to find the rhythm. His pulse skipped a beat, then another, caught in the gravity of the star-shard. For a terrifying moment, his chest was silent, the world falling into a profound, absolute stillness. \n\nThen, his heart kicked. \n\nThump.\n\nAt the same microsecond, the shard in his hand pulsed. \n\nThump.\n\nThe two rhythms merged. The hiss faded into a low, constant thrum that resided in the marrow of his radius bone, a vibration that made the pewter filament feel heavy and solid once more. The pain didn't vanish, but it shifted into a dull, manageable ache, a permanent weight that anchored him to the earth.\n\nKaelen slumped back against the obsidian rim, his hand still curled around the shard. The violet light had dimmed, retreating into the core of the stone. His right arm was no longer a useless weight; he could feel his fingers again, though they felt distant, as if he were wearing thick leather gloves. He flexed his hand. The black lines beneath the skin shifted with the movement, a permanent record of the bargain he had just struck.\n\nThe metallic scent of scorched copper was fading, replaced by the neutral, biting cold of the mountain night. He looked up, his gaze following the jagged silhouette of the valley walls to the horizon. \n\nThere, perched like a broken crown atop the highest peak, was the High Spire. It was silhouetted against a sky that looked heavy, the stars themselves seeming to sag under an invisible weight. The Spire was tilting, a lean that spoke of foundational rot and the death of the old world. \n\nHe had the shard. He had the map, even if he didn't yet know how to read it. But the Order was gone, and the Oath he carried was no longer the one he had sworn as a novice. It was something new, something starwrought and scarred.\n\nKaelen pushed himself to his feet. His legs were shaky, his lungs still felt as though they had been scrubbed with sand, but the synchronization held. With every beat of his heart, the shard hummed in his hand, a constant reminder of the ticking clock. \n\nHe didn't look back at the crater. He didn't look at the glass valley where the shadow-forms waited for the sun to drop further. He turned his face toward the Spire and began the ascent. Every step was a struggle, a calculated shift of weight against the gravity of his new burden, but he moved with a grim, forward-motion that the old Kaelen, the one who had merely watched the wards, would not have recognized.\n\nThe silence of the Silver Valley was absolute, save for the rhythmic, metallic scrape of his boots and the steady, synchronized thrum of a heart that no longer belonged entirely to a man.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\"CHAR_kaelen\"],\n    \"location\": \"Silver Valley - Rim of the Impact Crater\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Kaelen has successfully bound the star-shard to his physical Starwrought Oath.\",\n      \"The pewter filament in Kaelen's radius bone has integrated the shard's necrotic pulse.\",\n      \"Kaelen experienced a vision of a cosmic beast consuming a dying galaxy upon touching the shard.\",\n      \"Kaelen's heartbeat is now synchronized with the shard's 'thump-hiss' resonance.\",\n      \"The frost-burn on Kaelen's right arm has been partially replaced by black, starwrought scarring.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\"THREAD_oath_binding\", \"THREAD_starfall_corruption\", \"THREAD_ancient_legacy\"]\n  },\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Kaelen reached the crater's rim after a grueling escape from shadow-forms.\",\n      \"He confronted the volatile resonance of the star-shard, which threatened to destroy his arm and the failing Oath-filament.\",\n      \"By forcing his remaining essence into the pewter filament, Kaelen bound the shard to his life force, experiencing a terrifying cosmic vision in the process.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Kaelen collapses on the crater rim, suffering from previous frost-burn and scorched lungs.\",\n      \"The star-shard's 'thump-hiss' resonance intensifies, forcing Kaelen to attempt a stabilization rite.\",\n      \"Upon touching the shard, Kaelen sees a vision of a cosmic beast and a dying galaxy.\",\n      \"Kaelen bridges the gap between the shard and the physical pewter filament in his radius bone.\",\n      \"The shard's pulse and Kaelen's heartbeat synchronize, stabilizing his physical condition at the cost of permanent corruption.\",\n      \"Kaelen observes the tilting High Spire and begins his ascent, now carrying the 'Star-Heart'.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"The Starwrought Oath is a physical pewter filament woven into the radius bone.\",\n      \"Magic and star-matter proximity cause physical frost-burn, scorched lungs, and metallic scents.\",\n      \"The star-shard is now physically and magically bound to Kaelen's life force.\",\n      \"The cosmic beast is a real and present threat established through the shard's vision.\",\n      \"Kaelen's right arm bears black, starwrought scarring from the integration.\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Kaelen has successfully claimed the first star-shard, binding it to his failing Oath to survive.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"threads_touched\": [\"THREAD_oath_binding\", \"THREAD_starfall_corruption\", \"THREAD_ancient_legacy\"]\n}",

Your writing is characterized by a tight, limited third-person perspective that never breaks into omniscient narration. You must maintain strict continuity, ensuring that characters utilize their full range of established skills and knowledge. Do not use 'As you know' dialogue or provide summaries of previous events. When a scene begins, drop the reader directly into the character's current sensory experience. Avoid clich\u00e9s in descriptions; instead of 'cold as ice,' describe the 'brittle, biting snap of air that makes the lungs ache.' Ensure all plot payoffs are seeded with subtle clues in earlier movements. Magic and high-fantasy elements must have clear costs and logical consistency.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"The Silver Fracture\",\"goal\":\"Witness the starfall and establish Kaelen's failing

Kaelen hauled himself over the final ledge, his boots scraping against the slick, vitrified earth. He didn\u2019t stand; he couldn't. He collapsed onto the cold, wind-scoured shelf, his chest heaving in shallow, ragged bursts. Each inhalation was a penance, the air tasting of scorched copper and the sharp, ozone-heavy scent of a lightning strike. It wasn't just the altitude of the High Spire\u2019s foothills that thinned the oxygen; it was the way the star-shard in his satchel seemed to consume the very atmosphere around it.\n\nHis right arm lay across his lap, a heavy, useless thing of waxy flesh and mottled purple bruising. The frost-burn had taken hold during the climb, a creeping numbness that felt less like cold and more like the absence of life. The skin was translucent in the dying violet light of the valley, stretched tight over the radius bone where the Starwrought Oath resided. \n\nHe could feel it\u2014the pewter filament. It was no longer a smooth, supportive anchor within his marrow. The discharge at the crater\u2019s floor had turned the metal brittle. Every time he shifted, he felt the sickening, microscopic grind of metal against bone, a dry clicking that vibrated up into his shoulder. The Oath was fracturing, the physical manifestation of his failure to hold the wards. It was supposed to be a conduit, a holy tether to the celestial order, but now it felt like a splinter of lead poisoning his blood.\n\nA rhythmic sound pulsed from the leather satchel at his hip. \n\n*Thump-hiss.*\n\nIt was the heartbeat of a dying sun, a heavy, concussive vibration that hit the back of Kaelen\u2019s teeth, followed by a sibilant leak of energy that made the fine hairs on his neck stand on end. The satchel jerked against his thigh. The shard was waking up, its alien resonance seeking a host, a ground, a way to stabilize its own collapsing essence. If he didn't contain it, the pulse would grow until it shattered the container\u2014and Kaelen along with it.\n\nHe reached out with his left hand, his fingers trembling with exhaustion. The movement was slow, deliberate. He had to be careful; the shadow-forms were gone for now, but the violet glow of the valley was a beacon for anything else that moved in the dark. He unbuckled the strap. The *thump-hiss* grew louder, more insistent. A plume of pale violet vapor escaped the bag, smelling of old graves and cold iron.\n\nKaelen gritted his teeth, the metallic tang in his mouth intensifying until he felt he was sucking on a coin. He reached into the satchel and closed his hand around the shard.\n\nThe agony was instantaneous. It wasn't heat\u2014it was a vacuum. The shard didn't burn his palm; it tried to pull the warmth out of his marrow, a predatory cold that raced up his arm and collided with the fractured pewter filament in his wrist. His lungs seized, the air in his windpipe turning to shards of ice. He couldn't scream; there was no breath left to carry the sound. \n\nHe forced his eyes to stay open. He had to see the binding. He had to witness the cost.\n\nThe pewter filament in his radius bone began to glow, not with the steady, silver light of the High Spire, but with a frantic, stuttering violet. The metal was reacting to the shard\u2019s proximity, the two forces\u2014the ancient Oath and the fallen star\u2014grinding together like tectonic plates. Kaelen\u2019s vision blurred, the edges of the world fraying into grey static. \n\nHe focused on the center of his wrist, where the waxy skin was beginning to smoke. He had to bridge the gap. He had to offer the shard a path into the Oath, or the resonance would tear his arm apart. \n\nWith a guttural, wordless grunt of effort, Kaelen pushed his remaining Oath-essence into the fractured metal. He visualized the filament not as a broken wire, but as a starving root. He commanded the pewter to reach out, to drink from the shard's necrotic pulse. \n\nThe *thump-hiss* changed. The *thump* became a hammer blow against his soul, and the *hiss* became a roar in his ears. The violet light flared, blindingly bright, illuminating the veins in his arm like a map of a shattered kingdom. The pewter filament groaned\u2014a physical sound, a metallic shriek muffled by muscle and skin. Kaelen felt the metal heat up, the friction of the binding melting the ice of the frost-burn. \n\nIt was a different kind of pain. The numbness was replaced by a searing, liquid fire that followed the line of the Oath from his wrist to his elbow. He watched, fascinated and horrified, as the waxy discoloration of his skin began to recede, replaced by a network of thin, black lines that traced the path of the new corruption. The shard wasn't being contained; it was being integrated.\n\nThe resonance began to slow. \n\n*Thump... hiss.*\n\n*Thump... hiss.*\n\nKaelen\u2019s own heart, laboring in his chest, began to stutter, trying to find the rhythm. His pulse skipped a beat, then another, caught in the gravity of the star-shard. For a terrifying moment, his chest was silent, the world falling into a profound, absolute stillness. \n\nThen, his heart kicked. \n\n*Thump.*\n\nAt the same microsecond, the shard in his hand pulsed. \n\n*Thump.*\n\nThe two rhythms merged. The *hiss* faded into a low, constant thrum that resided in the marrow of his radius bone, a vibration that made the pewter filament feel heavy and solid once more. The pain didn't vanish, but it shifted into a dull, manageable ache, a permanent weight that anchored him to the earth.\n\nKaelen slumped back against the obsidian rim, his hand still curled around the shard. The violet light had dimmed, retreating into the core of the stone. His right arm was no longer a useless weight; he could feel his fingers again, though they felt distant, as if he were wearing thick leather gloves. He flexed his hand. The black lines beneath the skin shifted with the movement, a permanent record of the bargain he had just struck.\n\nThe metallic scent of scorched copper was fading, replaced by the neutral, biting cold of the mountain night. He looked up, his gaze following the jagged silhouette of the valley walls to the horizon. \n\nThere, perched like a broken crown atop the highest peak, was the High Spire. It was silhouetted against a sky that looked heavy, the stars themselves seeming to sag under an invisible weight. The Spire was tilting, a lean that spoke of foundational rot and the death of the old world. \n\nHe had the shard. He had the map, even if he didn't yet know how to read it. But the Order was gone, and the Oath he carried was no longer the one he had sworn as a novice. It was something new, something starwrought and scarred.\n\nKaelen pushed himself to his feet. His legs were shaky, his lungs still felt as though they had been scrubbed with sand, but the synchronization held. With every beat of his heart, the shard hummed in his hand, a constant reminder of the ticking clock. \n\nHe didn't look back at the crater. He didn't look at the glass valley where the shadow-forms waited for the sun to drop further. He turned his face toward the Spire and began the ascent. Every step was a struggle, a calculated shift of weight against the gravity of his new burden, but he moved with a grim, forward-motion that the old Kaelen, the one who had merely watched the wards, would not have recognized.\n\nThe silence of the Silver Valley was absolute, save for the rhythmic, metallic scrape of his boots and the steady, synchronized thrum of a heart that no longer belonged entirely to a man.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n
