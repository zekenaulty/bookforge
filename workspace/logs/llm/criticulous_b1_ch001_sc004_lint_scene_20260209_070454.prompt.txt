SYSTEM:

# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
Item naming: use display_name for prose; use item_id only in JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Continuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.
Continuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.
Durable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.
Inventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.
If mechanics are shown in prose or UI, they must be present in continuity system state or added in continuity system updates in the same STATE_PATCH.
For durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
For durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).
Use canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.


USER:

# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Check and require that any UI mechanic values in prose are owned by continuity system state and match candidate values.
- Treat only authoritative surfaces as canonical-check targets; do not enforce canonical labels in narrative prose.
- For authoritative surfaces, prefer exact canonical item/device labels from registries.
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).
- Deterministically enforce scene-card durable constraints (`required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; optional `required_visible_on_page`).
- Report missing durable context ids with explicit retry hints instead of guessing canon.

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The Lesser Forest Slime didn’t have a face, but it definitely had an attitude. It jiggled with a predatory rhythm, its translucent green mass pulsing like a neon stress ball filled with spite. 

[Lesser Forest Slime - Lvl 1] [HP: 10/10]

I backed up until the rough, gnarled bark of the ancient oak tree bit into my shoulder blades. My heart was doing a frantic drum solo against my ribs, a reminder that my current HP was exactly one. If a stray breeze carried too much pollen, I was pretty sure the System would consider it a lethal status effect.

"Okay, Artie. Think. It’s just physics and bad programming," I muttered, my fingers white-knuckled around the metal loop of my Keyring. My Honda Civic keys dangled like the world’s saddest flail. "I have a hundred percent crit rate. I just need to touch it. One tap, and the math does the rest."

The slime lunged. It didn’t crawl; it launched itself like a glob of radioactive snot.

I swung the keys with a desperate, uncoordinated yelp.

[Miss!]

The slime flattened itself against the grass, the metal teeth of my house keys whistling through the empty air where its "head" had been a microsecond before. I stumbled, my balance—or lack thereof—sending me teetering toward the very thing that wanted to dissolve my shins.

"Right. Agility of a sedentary potato. Noted," I wheezed, scrambling to reset my stance.

The creature recoiled, its gelatinous body shivering as it prepared for a second pass. It looked like it was laughing at me. I didn't blame it. I was a grown man in a business-casual button-down trying to fight a puddle with a grocery store loyalty card.

It hopped again. I swung low this time, aiming for the base.

[Miss!]

The slime performed a graceful, mid-air pirouette that would have made a gymnast weep. It sailed over my hand, landing with a wet *thwack* just inches from my left shoe. I jumped back, nearly tripping over a protruding root.

[Warning: HP 1/1. Any contact will result in immediate character deletion.]

"I know! I'm working on it!" I shouted at the floating red text. 

I tried a tactical thrust. It was a move I’d seen in a dozen movies, a sharp jab intended to puncture. 

[Miss!]

The slime didn't even move this time. It just... shifted. A hole opened up in the center of its mass, and my hand passed straight through the gap. The metal keys clattered against each other, ringing out in the quiet woods like a dinner bell for my own funeral. I yanked my arm back before the hole could close around my wrist.

"Three misses," I panted. "The RNG gods aren't even spitting on me. They’re just ignoring my existence."

The slime was getting bolder. It began to circle me, its green surface darkening. It was charging up. I could see the internal pressure building, the slime becoming more opaque as it prepared a high-velocity strike.

I lunged forward, trying to catch it off-balance.

[Miss!]

My foot slipped on a patch of damp moss. Instead of a heroic strike, I performed a rhythmic flail that ended with me hugging the ancient oak tree for dear life. The slime didn't even have to dodge; I’d missed by a solid three feet.

"This is it," I whispered, watching the slime coil itself into a tight, vibrating spring. "I’m going to be the first person in history to be killed by a Level 1 tutorial mob while having a literal cheat-code build."

The slime launched. It was a green blur, a projectile of pure aggression.

I didn't think. I didn't aim. I just closed my eyes and swung my right hand in a wide, panicked arc, the Keyring trailing behind like a comet of silver and plastic.

[Miss!]

The keys hit the air. The slime sailed past my ear. I felt the rush of wind, the cold sensation of death missing me by a fraction of an inch. That was five. Five misses. I was a statistical impossibility of failure.

But as I swung, my momentum carried me around. I was spinning, a human top of pure incompetence. My hand, still clutching the keys, slammed into the trunk of the ancient oak tree. 

Except, it didn't just hit the tree. 

The edge of my thumb—just a tiny sliver of skin—brushed against the trailing edge of the slime as it tried to recover from its leap.

The world turned white.

[SYSTEM ALERT: CRITICAL HIT!]
[CALCULATING DAMAGE...]
[ERROR: CRIT RATE 100% DETECTED]
[ERROR: NESTED MULTIPLIER DETECTED]
[ERROR: MATH.EXE HAS ENCOUNTERED A PROBLEM]
[SUPER-MEGA-ULTRA-CRIT!]

A sound like a thunderclap inside a library shattered the silence of the Whispering Woods. A pillar of pure, incandescent light erupted from the point of contact. It wasn't just a hit; it was a localized apocalypse. 

I felt a shockwave ripple through my arm, but it didn't hurt. It felt like... static. Like my entire body was being recalculated in real-time. 

When the light faded, the slime was gone. It wasn't dead; it was deleted. There wasn't even a stain on the grass. 

But it wasn't just the slime. 

The ancient oak tree—the massive, multi-ton landmark I had been cornered against—was gone. In its place was a perfectly circular, cauterized crater that extended twenty feet into the forest floor. The upper branches of the neighboring trees were smoldering, their leaves turned to ash by the sheer thermal output of a single, accidental punch.

I stood there, my hand still extended, clutching a Keyring that was now glowing with a faint, dying ember of blue light.

[System Notification]
[Target: Lesser Forest Slime (Lvl 1) - OBLITERATED]
[Damage Dealt: 9,999,999 (Overkill)]
[Experience Gained: 150 (Tutorial Bonus Applied)]

[LEVEL UP!]
[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon: Level 1 -> Level 2]

[Stat Points Awarded: 5]
[Current HP: 1/1 (Fixed)]

I stared at the crater. Then I looked at my keys. The plastic fob for my local gym had melted into a shapeless blob, but the keys themselves were fine. 

"Well," I said, my voice cracking. "At least I don't have to worry about the tree anymore."

I checked my status window. The '1/1' next to my HP was still there, mocking me in bright, neon red. Level 2 didn't change the fact that a stiff breeze could end my journey, but it did mean the System was officially tracking my carnage.

"Fizz?" I called out, looking around the smoking ruin of the tutorial zone. "I think I broke the woods."

There was no answer, just the sound of falling ash and the distant, confused chirping of birds that had somehow survived the math-based explosion. 

I looked down at my hand. My thumb was fine. Not a scratch. The 100% Crit Rate hadn't just made me powerful; it had turned me into a walking glitch. And if a Level 1 slime caused this much damage, I was terrified to see what would happen when I actually tried to hit something on purpose.

[Title Progress: Anomaly - 1%]

"Great," I muttered, wiping soot off my shirt. "I'm not a hero. I'm a bug report."
