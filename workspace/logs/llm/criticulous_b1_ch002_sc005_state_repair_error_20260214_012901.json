  "prompt": {
    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nUI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says \"always include\".\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it unless explicitly removing a stale fact with REMOVE and restating the current truth.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v2\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}]\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the

You must output a corrected STATE_PATCH JSON only.\nNo prose, no commentary, no code fences.\n\nGoal:\n- Ensure state_patch fully and accurately captures the scene's events and outcomes.\n- Fill missing summary_update data and fix invalid formats from draft_patch.\n- Preserve pre-scene invariants unless this scene changes them; when it does, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n  - If this scene changes a durable fact (stats/HP/status/title/custody), you MUST update must_stay_true to reflect the final end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove or replace any prior must_stay_true entries that conflict with new durable values.\n  - Do NOT carry forward conflicting legacy invariants once the scene updates them.\n\n- must_stay_true removal (mandatory when a durable fact is superseded):\n  - Add \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" in summary_update.must_stay_true.\n  - Place REMOVE lines before the new final invariant.\n  - REMOVE lines also apply to key_facts_ring (purge stale facts from continuity).\n\n- Ensure mechanic/UI ownership in continuity system updates.\n\nRules:\n- Output a single JSON object that matches the state_patch schema.\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for world_updates.cast_present.\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for world_updates.open_threads.\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- summary_update arrays are required: last_scene (2-4 sentences), key_events (3-7 bullets), must_stay_true (3-7 bullets), chapter_so_far_add (bullets).\n- Continuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- UI gate: only include bracketed UI blocks when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If false, remove or rephrase UI blocks into narrative prose.\n\n- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.\n- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.\n- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.\n- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene..\n- titles are arrays of objects with stable name fields; do not emit titles as plain strings.\n- Canonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\n- If item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for authoritative labels and custody terms.\n- Use item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If prose depicts a durable appearance change, include character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- Do NOT set summary or art text in appearance_updates (derived after acceptance).\n\nNaming repairs:\n- If lint flags an item naming issue, fix it with minimal edits.\n- Do not remove humor; simply anchor the item (add display_name near first mention) and ensure custody-change sentences include the display_name.\n- Do not rename item_id or registry fields; only adjust prose wording.\n- Do not add numeric mechanics to invariants_add; store them in continuity system updates instead.\n- If an event appears in prose, it must appear in key_events.\n- must_stay_true must include milestone ledger entries and any inventory/injury/ownership invariants implied by prose.\n- Inventory posture reconciliation:\n  - If inventory/containers change (held/stowed/container), must_stay_true must be updated to the final posture.\n  - Add REMOVE lines for prior inventory/container invariants before the new final entries.\n  - Use canonical invariant formats:\n    - inventory: CHAR_X -> <item display_name> (status=held|carried|equipped|stowed, container=hand_left|hand_right|<container>)\n    - container: <container> (owner=CHAR_X, contents=[<item display_name>, ...])\n- character_updates entries must use arrays: persona_updates (array), invariants_add (array).\n- character_updates.inventory must be an array of objects, never item-id strings.\n- Inventory object shape: {\"item\": \"ITEM_or_name\", \"container\": \"hand_left|hand_right|<container>\", \"status\": \"held|carried|equipped|stowed\"}.\n  - Container object shape: {\"container\": \"<name>\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_id\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_id\", \"...\"]}.\n- Use character_continuity_system_updates / global_continuity_system_updates to reconcile mechanics.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects.

Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_device_id, replacement_of.\n  - custodian must be a non-null string id/scope (character id or \"world\"). Never use null.\n    - INVALID: \"custodian\": null\n    - VALID: \"custodian\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\" or \"world\"\n  - owner_scope must be \"character\" or \"world\" and must match the custodian scope.\n  - plot_device_updates: set must include name, custody_scope, custody_ref, activation_state, linked_threads, constraints, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n\n- Transfer vs registry conflict rule (must follow):\n  - If you create a NEW item in item_registry_updates with final custodian already set (e.g., CHAR_ARTIE), DO NOT emit transfer_updates for that item.\n  - If you emit transfer_updates for a NEW item, the registry entry must start with custodian=\"world\" and then transfer to the character.\n  - expected_before must match the registry entry at the moment of transfer (after any registry update that applies before it).  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects; never an object with an `updates` field.\n\n  - inventory_alignment_updates[*].set MUST be an object (not a list).\n    - INVALID: \"set\": []\n    - VALID:   \"set\": {\"inventory\": [...], \"containers\": [...]}\n- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.\n- If durable mutation is implied but ambiguous, keep canonical state unchanged and emit an explicit repair note in reason fields.\n- Honor scene-card durable constraints (`required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; optional `required_visible_on_page`).\n- Respect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`; avoid physical custody changes in non-present/non-real scope unless explicit override is present.\n\n- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):\n  - If timeline_scope != \"present\" OR ontological_scope != \"real\", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).\n  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.\n  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category=\"timeline_override\".\n\nInputs\n- prose: final scene text\n- state: pre-scene state\n- draft_patch: patch returned by write/repair (may be incomplete)\n- continuity_pack: pre-write continuity pack\n- character_states: current cast-only character state\n\nScene card:\n{\n  \"cast_present\": [\n    \"Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon\"\n  ],\n  \"cast_present_ids\": [\n    \"CHAR_ARTIE\"\n  ],\n  \"chapter\": 2,\n  \"conflict\": \"A Skeleton Archer's arrows vs. Artie's 1 HP fragility.\",\n  \"constraints\": [\n    \"target_words: 2000\",\n    \"no-recaps\"\n  ],\n  \"continuity_system_focus\": [\n    \"stats\",\n    \"skills\",\n    \"resources\"\n  ],\n  \"device_presence\": [],\n  \"end_condition\": \"Artie successfully dodges the archer and prepares to counter-attack or move deeper.\",\n  \"forbidden_visible\": [],\n  \"goal\": \"Test the Cloak's evasion against a projectile and validate Pattern Recognition.\",\n  \"introduces\": [],\n  \"introduces_ids\": [],\n  \"ontological_scope\": \"real\",\n  \"required_callbacks\": [\n    \"milestone: pattern_recognition_unlocked\"\n  ],\n  \"required_in_custody\": [\n    \"ITEM_ID_BADGE\",\n    \"ITEM_SMARTPHONE\",\n    \"ITEM_PARTICIPATION_TROPHY\",\n    \"ITEM_CLOAK_COWARDLY_LION\"\n  ],\n  \"required_scene_accessible\": [\n    \"ITEM_CLOAK_COWARDLY_LION\",\n    \"ITEM_PARTICIPATION_TROPHY\"\n  ],\n  \"required_visible_on_page\": [\n    \"ITEM_CLOAK_COWARDLY_LION\",\n    \"ITEM_PARTICIPATION_TROPHY\"\n  ],\n  \"scene\": 5,\n  \"scene_id\": \"SC_002_005\",\n  \"scene_target\": \"Artie survives his first ranged encounter and gains confidence.\",\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.1\",\n  \"thread_ids\": [],\n  \"timeline_scope\": \"present\",\n  \"transition_type\": \"standard\",\n  \"ui_allowed\": true,\n  \"ui_mechanics_expected\": [\n    \"HP\",\n    \"Evasion\",\n    \"System Notification\",\n    \"Aggro Meter\"\n  ]\n}\n\nContinuity pack:\n{\n  \"cast_present\": [\n    \"Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon\"\n  ],\n  \"constraints\": [\n    \"Artie is Level 2 with 1/1 HP, 100% Crit Rate, 50 Evasion, and 100% Aggro.\",\n    \"Artie possesses the Pattern Recognition (Rank G) skill.\",\n    \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Cloak of the Cowardly Lion (status=equipped, container=back)\",\n    \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Participation Trophy (status=held, container=hand_left, soul-bound=TRUE)\",\n    \"Artie is under the 'Marked for Death' and 'Monster Beacon' statuses (Active).\",\n    \"Artie is under the 'Coward's Shame' and 'Coward's Sprint' statuses.\",\n    \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Corporate ID Badge (status=equipped, container=neck)\",\n    \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Cracked Smartphone (status=stowed, container=pocket_right)\"\n  ],\n  \"location\": \"Low-Level Crypts\",\n  \"next_action\": \"Artie must use Pattern Recognition to dodge arrows from a Skeleton Archer while maintaining his 1 HP survival streak.\",\n  \"open_threads\": [\n    \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\",\n    \"THREAD_SYSTEM_GLITCH\",\n    \"THREAD_VANE_RIVALRY\"\n  ],\n  \"scene_end_anchor\": \"Artie entered the Low-Level Crypts, where his neon yellow cloak acted as a monster beacon, pushing his Aggro Meter to 100%.

it screamed. In the oppressive dampness of the Low-Level Crypts, the neon yellow fabric pulsed with the rhythmic intensity of a strobe light at a rave no one wanted to attend. It was a tactical disaster. It was a visual assault. It was currently the only thing keeping Artie from becoming a very thin smear on the floor.\n\nA dry *clack-whirr* echoed from the shadows ahead.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 100% (Critical Density)]\n[Warning: You are currently a 'Monster Beacon'. Stealth is mathematically impossible.]\n\n\"Yeah, thanks, I noticed,\" Artie whispered, his voice cracking. He shifted his grip on the Participation Trophy. The gold-plated plastic was cold in his left hand, its weight a constant reminder that he was legally and magically obligated to be here. \n\nFrom the darkness of a collapsed alcove, a Skeleton Archer stepped into the garish yellow light. It was a collection of yellowed ribs and spite, held together by graying sinew. It didn't have eyes, but the way it leveled its notched bow at his chest suggested it didn't need them.\n\n[Skeleton Archer - Lvl 4] [HP: 22/22]\n\n\"Twenty-two health,\" Artie muttered, his heart hammering against his ribs\u2014a very fragile cage for a very fragile 1 HP life. \"And he\u2019s got the high ground. Sort of. It\u2019s a slightly elevated pile of rubble.\"\n\nThe archer drew back the string. The sound was a precise, three-beat rhythm. *Creeee-ack. Snap.*\n\nThe arrow was a blur of dark wood. Artie's brain screamed *run*, but his body had other plans. As the projectile neared, the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion flared. His legs didn't just move; they buckled in a very specific, cowardly fashion. He felt a phantom tug at his spine, a jerk of automated terror that sent him into a frantic, uncoordinated roll.\n\n[Evasion Proc! (50% Chance)]\n[Effect: Coward's Shame - You avoided certain death, but you looked like a startled hamster doing it.]\n[HP: 1/1]\n\nThe arrow hissed through the space where his throat had been a microsecond ago, slamming into a stone pillar with a crack that made his teeth ache.\n\n\"Okay,\" Artie panted, scrambling to his feet. The neon glow of the cloak was reflecting off the stone, casting long, dancing shadows. \"Okay. I can work with this. It\u2019s just like the spreadsheet audits back at the firm. Data entry. Input, output, repeat.\"\n\nThe archer reached for another arrow. *Reach. Notch. Draw.*\n\n[Skill Active: Pattern Recognition (Rank G)]\n[Analysis: Enemy reload speed is 2.4 seconds. Arrow velocity is constant. The 'beat' is 120 BPM. Move on the upbeat.]\n\n\"One, and two, and\u2014\"\n\nArtie dived right. The second arrow skipped off the floor, sparks flying. He didn't wait for the cloak to trigger this time. He was already counting.\n\n\"Three, and four, and\u2014\"\n\nHe zig-zagged, his Corporate ID Badge bouncing against his chest. The archer was fast, but it was a script. A loop. And if there was one thing Arthur Penhaligon knew, it was how to find the error in a looping script. \n\nThe third arrow caught the edge of the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion, passing through the neon fabric without touching skin. He felt the wind of it. His Aggro Meter spiked, the red bar vibrating so hard it looked like it might shatter.\n\n[Evasion Proc! (50% Chance)]\n[Stamina: 64/100]\n\n\"Is that all you've got?\" Artie yelled, the adrenaline finally overriding the crushing weight of the 'Coward's Shame' debuff. \"I've had vending machines with better aim than you!\"\n\nHe wasn't just dodging anymore; he was timing it. He was sliding into the gaps between the frames of the world. Each arrow was a missed deadline, a corrupted cell in a column, and he was the delete key. \n\nThe archer paused, its jawbone dropping as it reached for a quiver that was suddenly empty. It stood there, a Level 4 threat rendered impotent by a Level 2 glitch in a yellow raincoat. \n\n\"My turn,\" Artie said, though he had no idea what 'my turn' actually looked like yet. He just knew he was still at 1 HP, and for the first time since he died, he wasn't just lucky.
