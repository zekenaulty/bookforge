PROSE:

The Snack-O-Matic 9000 was a cruel, unyielding mistress, and she was currently holding my lunch hostage.

I stood in the office breakroom, the fluorescent lights overhead flickering with a rhythmic, soul-sucking hum that matched the dull throb in my temples. My Polyester Suit—a bargain-bin special that possessed the breathability of a plastic trash bag—was already sticking to my lower back. It was 2:15 PM on a Tuesday. I had three spreadsheets due by five, a supervisor who used "synergy" as a threat, and a stomach that was currently performing a convincing impression of a dying whale.

I looked down at my right hand. The One Dollar Coin sat there, a dull gold disc that represented the absolute limit of my liquid assets until Friday’s direct deposit hit. This wasn't just a dollar; it was a bridge to the only thing that could get me through the afternoon: a bag of Zesty Ranch Zings.

"Don't do it, Artie," I whispered to myself. "She smells weakness."

I ignored my own advice. I leaned forward, the Plastic ID Badge clipped to my belt clinking against the machine’s glass. I slid the coin into the slot.

The machine swallowed it with a mechanical gulp. I pressed the buttons: B-4. The metal spiral began to rotate. It was a slow, agonizing crawl, the bag of Zings inching forward like a condemned man walking toward the gallows. The spiral completed its turn. The bag tipped. It leaned.

And then, it stopped.

The bag was dangling by a single, microscopic corner of crimped plastic, caught on the very tip of the metal coil. It swayed gently in the stagnant air of the breakroom, mocking me.

"You have got to be kidding me," I muttered, pressing my forehead against the cool glass. 

I checked my internal stats. If I had a UI, my 'Patience' bar would be flashing red and emitting a high-pitched whine. I looked around. The breakroom was empty, save for a half-empty pot of coffee that looked like it had been brewed during the Nixon administration. No witnesses.

I gripped the sides of the Snack-O-Matic. "Give. Me. My. Zings."

I gave the machine a firm shake. The glass rattled. The bag of chips didn't budge. It just swung there, a neon-orange middle finger to my existence. 

My life felt like a series of poorly rolled checks. My 'Spreadsheet Management' skill was at a respectable Rank 4, sure, but it didn't help when the physical world decided to glitch out on me. I was a Level 28 Human Male with a 'Passive-Aggressive Emailing' sub-class and a 'Title' that probably read [Unsuspecting Victim of Late-Stage Capitalism].

I reached into the dispenser flap at the bottom, my arm disappearing into the dark, crumb-filled maw of the machine. I reached up, trying to find the bottom of the B-4 tray. My fingers brushed against cold metal and something that felt suspiciously like a petrified gummy bear.

"Just... one... inch..."

That’s when I heard it. A low, predatory growl coming from the guts of the machine. Not the sound of a cooling fan, but the sound of an electrical transformer reaching its breaking point. 

A blue spark jumped from the coin return to my thumb.

[Critical Hit! -10 HP]

The world didn't just go dark; it inverted. The beige walls of the breakroom shattered into a million jagged pixels. My Polyester Suit felt like it was melting into my skin, and for a brief, agonizing second, I could see the skeletal structure of my own hand illuminated by a surge of pure, unadulterated voltage.

I didn't even have time to scream. My heart, which had been at a steady 75 BPM, decided to skip the rest of the song and go straight to the silence at the end of the track.

[HP: 0/10]
[Status: Deceased]

Then came the void.

It wasn't black, exactly. It was the color of a monitor that was turned on but displaying nothing—a deep, humming grey that stretched out into infinity. I didn't have a body anymore, or if I did, it was currently being handled by the local paramedics back in the breakroom. I was just a point of consciousness floating in the digital soup.

"Great," I thought. "I died for Zesty Ranch Zings. My obituary is going to be a punchline."

Suddenly, a box of light snapped into existence in front of my non-existent eyes. It wasn't a heavenly gate or a tunnel of light. It was a window. A UI window.

[System Notification]
[User 'Arthur Penhaligon' has successfully disconnected from Server: EARTH_01.]
[Reason: Fatal Hardware Error (Vending Machine Malfunction).]

"Fatal hardware error?" I tried to shout, but the words only appeared as a thought-echo in the grey. "It was a bag of chips! I want a refund!"

[Scanning soul for compatible attributes...]
[Warning: Statistical Anomaly Detected.]
[Your 'Luck' stat is so low it has triggered an Integer Underflow.]

The grey void began to vibrate. 

[Recalculating...]
[Due to your unique circumstances, you have been selected for the 'Beta-Glitch' Compensation Package.]

[Welcome to the System. Please prepare for Character Creation.]

I stared at the floating text. This was it. The 'Ding' I’d been waiting for my entire life, even if I’d had to die to hear it. Somewhere in the back of my mind, the ghost of my Passive-Aggressive Emailing skill whispered that I should probably ask to speak to a manager about the electrocution, but the rest of me was too busy watching the numbers start to roll.
