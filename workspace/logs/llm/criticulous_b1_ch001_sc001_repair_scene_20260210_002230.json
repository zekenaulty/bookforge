  "text": "COMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: SC_001_001\nAllowed events: Artie argues with vending machine, electrocution, death, entry into the System void, first System prompt.\nForbidden milestones: None (Initial scene).\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: One Dollar Coin (hand_right), Plastic ID Badge (pocket_left), Polyester Suit (equipped).\n\nPROSE:\nThe Snack-O-Matic 9000 was a cruel, unyielding mistress, and she was currently holding Arthur Penhaligon\u2019s lunch hostage.\n\nArtie stood in the office breakroom, the fluorescent lights overhead flickering with a rhythmic, soul-sucking hum that matched the dull throb in his temples. His Polyester Suit\u2014a bargain-bin special that possessed the breathability of a plastic trash bag\u2014was already sticking to his lower back. It was 2:15 PM on a Tuesday. He had three spreadsheets due by five, a supervisor who used \"synergy\" as a threat, and a stomach that was currently performing a convincing impression of a dying whale.\n\nHe looked down at his right hand. The One Dollar Coin sat there, a dull gold disc that represented the absolute limit of his liquid assets until Friday\u2019s direct deposit hit. This wasn't just a dollar; it was a bridge to the only thing that could get him through the afternoon: a bag of Zesty Ranch Zings.\n\n\"Don't do it, Artie,\" he whispered to himself. \"She smells weakness.\"\n\nHe ignored his own advice. He leaned forward, the Plastic ID Badge tucked safely in his left pocket pressing against his thigh as he reached for the coin slot. He slid the dollar in.\n\nThe machine swallowed it with a mechanical gulp. Artie pressed the buttons: B-4. The metal spiral began to rotate. It was a slow, agonizing crawl, the bag of Zings inching forward like a condemned man walking toward the gallows. The spiral completed its turn. The bag tipped. It leaned.\n\nAnd then, it stopped.\n\nThe bag was dangling by a single, microscopic corner of crimped plastic, caught on the very tip of the metal coil. It swayed gently in the stagnant air of the breakroom, mocking him.\n\n\"You have got to be kidding me,\" Artie muttered, pressing his forehead against the cool glass. \n\nHe checked his internal state of mind. If he had a UI, his 'Patience' bar would be flashing red and emitting a high-pitched whine. He looked around. The breakroom was empty, save for a half-empty pot of coffee that looked like it had been brewed during the Nixon administration. No witnesses.\n\nArtie gripped the sides of the Snack-O-Matic. \"Give. Me. My. Zings.\"\n\nHe gave the machine a firm shake. The glass rattled. The bag of chips didn't budge. It just swung there, a neon-orange middle finger to his existence. \n\nHis life felt like a series of poorly rolled checks. His Spreadsheet Management skill was at a respectable Rank 4, sure, but it didn't help when the physical world decided to glitch out on him. He was just a man with a Rank 2 Passive-Aggressive Emailing skill and a Title that probably read [Unsuspecting Victim of Late-Stage Capitalism].\n\nHe reached into the dispenser flap at the bottom, his arm disappearing into the dark, crumb-filled maw of the machine. He reached up, trying to find the bottom of the B-4 tray. His fingers brushed against cold metal and something that felt suspiciously like a petrified gummy bear.\n\n\"Just... one... inch...\"\n\nThat\u2019s when he heard it. A low, predatory growl coming from the guts of the machine. Not the sound of a cooling fan, but the sound of an electrical transformer reaching its breaking point. \n\nA blue spark jumped from the coin return to his thumb.\n\n[System Notification]\n[Critical Hit! -10 HP]\n\nThe world didn't just go dark; it inverted. The beige walls of the breakroom shattered into a million jagged pixels. His Polyester Suit felt like it was melting into his skin, and for a brief, agonizing second, Artie could see the skeletal structure of his own hand illuminated by a surge of pure, unadulterated voltage.\n\nHe didn't even have time to scream. His heart, which had been at a steady 75 BPM, decided to skip the rest of the song and go straight to the silence at the end of the track.\n\n[HP: 0/10]\n[Status: Deceased]\n\nThen came the void.\n\nIt wasn't black, exactly. It was the color of a monitor that was turned on but displaying nothing\u2014a deep, humming grey that stretched out into infinity. Artie didn't have a body anymore, or if he did, it was currently being handled by the local paramedics back in the breakroom. He was just a point of consciousness floating in the digital soup.\n\n\"Great,\" he thought. \"I died for Zesty Ranch Zings. My obituary is going to be a punchline.\"\n\nSuddenly, a box of light snapped into existence in front of his non-existent eyes. It wasn't a heavenly gate or a tunnel of light. It was a window. A UI window.\n\n[System Notification]\n[User 'Arthur Penhaligon' has successfully disconnected from Server: EARTH_01.]\n[Reason: Fatal Hardware Error (Vending Machine Malfunction).]\n\n\"Fatal hardware error?\" Artie tried to shout, but the words only appeared as a thought-echo in the grey. \"It was a bag of chips! I want a refund!\"\n\n[Scanning soul for compatible attributes...]\n[Luck Stat: 1]\n[Warning: Statistical Anomaly Detected.]\n[Applying System Stress Test...]\n[Luck stat has triggered an Integer Underflow!]\n\nThe grey void began to vibrate. \n\n[Recalculating...]\n[Due to your unique circumstances, you have been selected for the 'Beta-Glitch' Compensation Package.]\n\n[Welcome to the System. Please prepare for Character Creation.]\n\nArtie stared at the floating text. This was it. The 'Ding' he\u2019d been waiting for his entire life, even if he\u2019d had to die to hear it. Somewhere in the back of his mind, the ghost of his Passive-Aggressive Emailing skill whispered that he should probably ask to speak to a manager about the electrocution, but the rest of him was too busy watching the numbers start to roll.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_ARTIE\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"The Void (Post-Death)\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie was killed by a malfunctioning Snack-O-Matic 9000.\",\n      \"Artie has entered the System's character creation void.\",\n      \"The System detected a Luck stat anomaly during the soul scan.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Arthur Penhaligon attempted to retrieve a stuck bag of chips from a vending machine and was fatally electrocuted.\",\n      \"Upon death, Artie's consciousness was transported to a grey void where a System UI began his character creation process.\",\n      \"The System identified a 'Luck' stat underflow, qualifying Artie for a special compensation package.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Artie spends his last dollar on a bag of Zesty Ranch Zings.\",\n      \"The vending machine jams, leading Artie to reach into the dispenser.\",\n      \"A massive electrical surge delivers a critical hit, reducing Artie's HP to 0.\",\n      \"Artie's soul is scanned by the System in the void.\",\n      \"The System triggers an Integer Underflow on Artie's Luck stat.\",\n      \"Artie is welcomed to the System for character creation.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"milestone: vending_machine_death = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: system_void_entry = DONE\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Polyester Suit (equipped, container=body)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Plastic ID Badge (stowed, container=pocket_left)\",\n      \"injury: deceased (status effect)\",\n      \"location: The Void (ontological_scope=system_void)\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Artie died in a mundane office accident and was drafted into a LitRPG system.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"character_continuity_system_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"delta\": {\n        \"stats\": {\n          \"hp\": {\n            \"current\": -10\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"set\": {\n        \"statuses\": {\n          \"deceased\": {\n            \"active\": true,\n            \"source\": \"vending_machine_electrocution\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"resources\": {\n          \"luck\": {\n            \"current\": \"NaN\",\n            \"underflow_triggered\": true\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"reason\": \"Death and subsequent System soul-scan anomaly.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 1,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\n          \"item\": \"ITEM_CHEAP_SUIT\",\n          \"container\": \"body\",\n          \"status\": \"equipped\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"item\": \"ITEM_ID_BADGE\",\n          \"container\": \"pocket_left\",\n          \"status\": \"stowed\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\n          \"container\": \"pocket_left\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n          \"contents\": [\n            \"ITEM_ID_BADGE\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"container\": \"pocket_right\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n          \"contents\": []\n        }\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie is now a disembodied consciousness reacting to the absurdity of his own death.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"inventory_alignment_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"item_id\": \"ITEM_DOLLAR_COIN\",\n      \"new_container\": \"vending_machine\",\n      \"new_status\": \"lost\",\n      \"reason\": \"Spent in vending machine prior to death.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"transfer_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"item_id\": \"ITEM_DOLLAR_COIN\",\n      \"source\": \"hand_right\",\n      \"destination\": \"vending_machine\",\n      \"reason\": \"Attempted purchase of Zesty Ranch Zings.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nItem naming: use display_name for prose; use item_id only in JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\n\ufeffOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the

Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\nFor held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\nContinuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nCanonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\nIf item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for authoritative labels and custody terms.\nUse item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nsummary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\nSTATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\nmust_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\nIf state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\nEnforce scene-card durable constraints: `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\nRespect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`; avoid physical durable custody changes in non-present/non-real scope unless explicit override is present.\nReturn corrected prose plus a corrected state_patch JSON block.\n\nOutput format (required, no code fences, no commentary):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n- All *_updates arrays must contain objects; never emit bare strings as array entries.\n- character_updates.containers must be an array of objects with at least: container, owner, contents (array).\n- Durable-state mutation blocks are mandatory when applicable:\n- Required fields for durable registry entries (when creating NEW ids or filling missing required fields):\n  - item_registry_updates: set must include name, type, owner_scope, custodian, linked_threads, state_tags, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_device_id, replacement_of.\n  - plot_device_updates: set must include name, custody_scope, custody_ref, activation_state, linked_threads, constraints, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects; never an object with an `updates` field.\n- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.\n- If you mutate durable state, do not leave the same mutation only in prose.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n  - Each entry must include character_id, chapter, scene, inventory (full current list), containers (full current list), invariants_add (array), persona_updates (array).\n  - character_updates.inventory MUST be an array of objects, never string item ids.\n  - Inventory object shape: {\"item\": \"ITEM_or_name\", \"container\": \"hand_left|hand_right|<container>\", \"status\": \"held|carried|equipped|stowed\"}.\n  - Container object shape: {\"container\": \"<name>\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_id\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_id\", \"...\"]}.\n  - If you have a single persona update, still wrap it in an array of strings.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger and invariants using standard phrasing, e.g.:\n  - Avoid numeric mechanics in must_stay_true; store them in continuity system updates instead.\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> shard (carried, container=satchel)\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> longsword (carried, container=hand_right)\n  - container: satchel (owner=CHAR_example, contents=[shard,

breakroom, the fluorescent lights overhead flickering with a rhythmic, soul-sucking hum that matched the dull throb in my temples. My Polyester Suit\u2014a bargain-bin special that possessed the breathability of a plastic trash bag\u2014was already sticking to my lower back. It was 2:15 PM on a Tuesday. I had three spreadsheets due by five, a supervisor who used \"synergy\" as a threat, and a stomach that was currently performing a convincing impression of a dying whale.\n\nI looked down at my right hand. The One Dollar Coin sat there, a dull gold disc that represented the absolute limit of my liquid assets until Friday\u2019s direct deposit hit. This wasn't just a dollar; it was a bridge to the only thing that could get me through the afternoon: a bag of Zesty Ranch Zings.\n\n\"Don't do it, Artie,\" I whispered to myself. \"She smells weakness.\"\n\nI ignored my own advice. I leaned forward, the Plastic ID Badge clipped to my belt clinking against the machine\u2019s glass. I slid the coin into the slot.\n\nThe machine swallowed it with a mechanical gulp. I pressed the buttons: B-4. The metal spiral began to rotate. It was a slow, agonizing crawl, the bag of Zings inching forward like a condemned man walking toward the gallows. The spiral completed its turn. The bag tipped. It leaned.\n\nAnd then, it stopped.\n\nThe bag was dangling by a single, microscopic corner of crimped plastic, caught on the very tip of the metal coil. It swayed gently in the stagnant air of the breakroom, mocking me.\n\n\"You have got to be kidding me,\" I muttered, pressing my forehead against the cool glass. \n\nI checked my internal stats. If I had a UI, my 'Patience' bar would be flashing red and emitting a high-pitched whine. I looked around. The breakroom was empty, save for a half-empty pot of coffee that looked like it had been brewed during the Nixon administration. No witnesses.\n\nI gripped the sides of the Snack-O-Matic. \"Give. Me. My. Zings.\"\n\nI gave the machine a firm shake. The glass rattled. The bag of chips didn't budge. It just swung there, a neon-orange middle finger to my existence. \n\nMy life felt like a series of poorly rolled checks. My 'Spreadsheet Management' skill was at a respectable Rank 4, sure, but it didn't help when the physical world decided to glitch out on me. I was a Level 28 Human Male with a 'Passive-Aggressive Emailing' sub-class and a 'Title' that probably read [Unsuspecting Victim of Late-Stage Capitalism].\n\nI reached into the dispenser flap at the bottom, my arm disappearing into the dark, crumb-filled maw of the machine. I reached up, trying to find the bottom of the B-4 tray. My fingers brushed against cold metal and something that felt suspiciously like a petrified gummy bear.\n\n\"Just... one... inch...\"\n\nThat\u2019s when I heard it. A low, predatory growl coming from the guts of the machine. Not the sound of a cooling fan, but the sound of an electrical transformer reaching its breaking point. \n\nA blue spark jumped from the coin return to my thumb.\n\n[Critical Hit! -10 HP]\n\nThe world didn't just go dark; it inverted. The beige walls of the breakroom shattered into a million jagged pixels. My Polyester Suit felt like it was melting into my skin, and for a brief, agonizing second, I could see the skeletal structure of my own hand illuminated by a surge of pure, unadulterated voltage.\n\nI didn't even have time to scream. My heart, which had been at a steady 75 BPM, decided to skip the rest of the song and go straight to the silence at the end of the track.\n\n[HP: 0/10]\n[Status: Deceased]\n\nThen came the void.\n\nIt wasn't black, exactly. It was the color of a monitor that was turned on but displaying nothing\u2014a deep, humming grey that stretched out into infinity. I didn't have a body anymore, or if I did, it was currently being handled by the local paramedics back in the breakroom. I was just a point of consciousness floating in the digital soup.\n\n\"Great,\" I thought. \"I died for Zesty Ranch Zings. My obituary is going to be a punchline.\"\n\nSuddenly, a box of light snapped into existence in front of my non-existent eyes. It wasn't a heavenly gate or a tunnel of light. It was a window. A UI window.\n\n[System Notification]\n[User 'Arthur Penhaligon' has successfully disconnected from Server: EARTH_01.]\n[Reason: Fatal Hardware Error (Vending Machine Malfunction).]\n\n\"Fatal hardware error?\" I tried to shout, but the words only appeared as a thought-echo in the grey. \"It was a bag of chips! I want a refund!\"\n\n[Scanning soul for compatible attributes...]\n[Warning: Statistical Anomaly Detected.]\n[Your 'Luck' stat is so low it has triggered an Integer Underflow.]\n\nThe grey void began to vibrate. \n\n[Recalculating...]\n[Due to your unique circumstances, you have been selected for the 'Beta-Glitch' Compensation Package.]\n\n[Welcome to the System. Please prepare for Character Creation.]\n\nI stared at the floating text. This was it. The 'Ding' I\u2019d been waiting for my entire life, even if I\u2019d had to die to hear it. Somewhere in the back of my mind, the ghost of my Passive-Aggressive Emailing skill whispered that I should probably ask to speak to a manager about the electrocution, but the rest of me was too busy
