PROSE:
The archives had been a tomb of freezing shadow, the heavy iron doors fused shut by the very wards they were meant to house. Driven upward by the encroaching chill, Kaelen had no choice but to climb. The spiral staircase of the High Spire was a throat of cold stone, and he was being swallowed by it. Every lungful of air tasted of pulverized limestone and the sharp, metallic tang of ozone. His boots skidded on the calcified grit—the spent residue of the outer wards, shedding from the walls like dry scales. The Great Seal's groan still vibrated in his teeth, a low-frequency tectonic shiver that suggested the mountain itself was tired of holding the sky.

He reached the upper gallery, a circular balcony that hung over the precipice of the Silver Valley. The wind here didn't just blow; it bit. It was a brittle, snapping thing that made his eyes water and his throat ache with the phantom heat of a forge. He leaned against a pillar of star-glass, his hand trembling. Beneath the leather of his left wrist, the Starwrought Oath—that pewter-colored thread woven directly into his marrow—pulsed with a frantic, uneven rhythm. It was no longer the steady hum of a sentinel’s duty; it was the staccato panic of a bird trapped in a cage, the tarnished metal of the bond vibrating against his radius bone.

He looked up, and the breath he had been struggling to catch died in his chest.

The stars were not supposed to be heavy. In the texts of the High Spire, they were described as the "Weightless Watchers," points of infinite distance and absolute purity. But tonight, the sky looked like a sagging canopy, weighted down by something immense and unseen. The constellations were distorted, the familiar lines of the Weaver and the Spear-Bearer stretched and warped as if viewed through a flawed lens. The blackness between the stars felt thick, almost viscous, as if the vacuum of space were pressing down on the atmosphere.

And then, the tear happened.

It wasn't a sound at first. It was a visual rupture, a jagged line of absolute blackness that opened between the Spear-Bearer’s shoulder and the horizon. From that void, a spark emerged. It began as a brilliant, blinding white—the pure, cold light of a celestial body. But as it descended, gravity seemed to catch it, and the purity curdled.

Kaelen gripped the railing, his knuckles turning the color of the calcified grit on the floor. The white light bled into a bruised, sickly violet. It wasn't the purple of a sunset or the soft hue of a lilac; it was the color of a deep, ancient bruise, a shade that felt like it was radiating heat and rot simultaneously. 

"Steady," Kaelen whispered, though whether to himself or the failing mountain, he didn't know. The Oath-thread in his marrow tightened, the pewter wire digging into the bone. The coldness of the magic began to seep out from the thread, turning his arm into a pillar of frost. He could feel the frost-burn starting in the back of his throat, the familiar, agonizing price of the Spire’s power. It was a dry, searing cold that made his lungs feel like they were being lined with glass.

The star was falling too fast. It didn't streak across the sky like a meteor; it fell like a stone dropped into a well. The violet trail it left behind didn't dissipate. It hung in the air, a glowing scar that began to pulse with a light that hurt to look at, a frequency that bypassed the eyes and thrummed directly in the brain.

The silence of the High Spire, usually so profound it felt like a physical weight, was suddenly replaced by a sound that defied categorization. It was a high-pitched, crystalline shriek, the sound of a thousand glass flutes being shattered at once. It wasn't coming from the air; it was coming from the stone beneath his feet. The Spire was screaming in sympathy with the dying star.

Kaelen watched, mesmerized and horrified, as the violet light expanded. The star was no longer a point of light; it was a jagged, irregular mass of burning glass. He could see the internal architecture of the thing—fractal geometries that shifted and collapsed as it tore through the atmosphere. It looked like a city made of lightning, falling toward the earth, dragging the weight of the void behind it.

He tried to summon the warding-light, to cast a shield that might protect the lower valley, but as he reached for the Oath, the thread in his marrow went limp. The energy drained out of it as if the star above were a vacuum, drinking the Spire’s essence. The cold in his arm vanished, replaced by a sudden, searing heat that made him cry out and pull back his sleeve. The pewter thread was glowing with the same sickly violet as the falling star, the heat of it charring the skin from the inside out.

"Varkas!" he shouted, his voice lost in the rising wind. "Commander!"

There was no answer from the sealed archives below. Only the sound of the wind, which had turned into a rhythmic thrumming, like the heartbeat of a giant.

The star was seconds from impact. It had cleared the peaks of the Iron Range, casting long, distorted shadows across the Silver Valley. The forests below, usually a deep, lush green, were illuminated in a ghostly, ultraviolet glare. The river that snaked through the valley floor looked like a vein of liquid mercury, reflecting the corruption of the sky.

Kaelen squeezed his eyes shut for a heartbeat, but the light was so intense it burned through his eyelids, painting the inside of his skull in shades of violet and black. He forced himself to look. He was a Watchman of the High Spire; he was the last witness to the Oath. If the world was going to end, he would not die with his eyes closed.

The star hit the valley floor three miles from the base of the Spire.

The impact was silent for the first second. Kaelen saw the earth simply... cease to be earth. Where the star landed, the soil and rock didn't explode; they liquified, turning into a fountain of white-hot glass that sprayed upward in a perfect, terrifying crown. The violet light intensified until it was the only thing in existence, a pillar of radiation that seemed to connect the earth to the void above.

Then, the sound arrived.

It wasn't a bang. It was a roar that had the weight of a mountain. It hit the High Spire like a physical fist. Kaelen was thrown backward, his head slamming into the star-glass pillar. The glass, designed to withstand the pressure of the heavens, shattered. A thousand shards, each as sharp as a razor, rained down on him.

But he didn't feel the cuts. He felt the shockwave.

It traveled through the air, but more importantly, it traveled through the Oath. The pewter thread in his marrow didn't just vibrate; it buckled. He felt a snap—not of bone, but of something more fundamental. A metaphysical fracture that resonated from his wrist, up his arm, and directly into his chest. The bond that had defined his lineage for generations was splintering under the pressure of the star's arrival.

His lungs, already scorched by the cold magic of the Spire, felt as if they had been filled with molten lead. He gasped, but there was no oxygen to be had, only the taste of burning minerals and the smell of something ancient and long-dead.

The Spire tilted.

Kaelen gripped the edge of the floor as the balcony groaned and began to sag toward the abyss. Below him, the Silver Valley was no longer a valley. It was a crater of roiling, violet-tinged smoke, at the center of which pulsed a rhythmic, alien beat. Thump. Thump. Thump.

It was the heartbeat of the shard.

Kaelen pulled himself toward the inner doorway, his fingers bleeding where they caught on the broken glass. The violet light was fading now, replaced by a thick, heavy darkness that seemed to be crawling up the sides of the mountain. The shadows weren't just the absence of light; they were tangible, like oil slicks moving against the wind, hungry and purposeful.

He looked back one last time at the impact site. The crown of glass had solidified, forming a jagged, translucent forest of razor-sharp pillars. And in the center, something was moving. Not a person, not an animal, but a shape of shadow and starlight, emerging from the wreckage of the sky.

The Oath in his wrist gave one final, dying pulse of violet, then went dark. 

Kaelen didn't wait for the Spire to collapse. He turned and plunged into the darkness of the interior, his mind a chaotic blur of failure and fear. The wards were gone. The star had fallen. And the Oath—the thing that defined his very existence—was fractured.

As he ran, the only sound he could hear was the rhythmic, alien thrumming from the valley floor, calling to the iron in his blood.
