# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
Prose hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative ("left hand", "right hand", "Artie", "his wallet").
Item naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.
Appearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Continuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.
Continuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.
Durable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.
JSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.
Inventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

﻿Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.
Durable vs ephemeral mechanics:
- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.
- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.
- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).
- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.
For durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
For durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).
Use canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.
- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.
  - INVALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": {"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}
  - VALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": [{"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}]


USER:

# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Classify UI/prose mechanic claims as DURABLE or EPHEMERAL before enforcing.
  - DURABLE: persistent stats/caps, skills/titles acquired, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, named mechanics referenced as invariants.
  - EPHEMERAL: roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat telemetry.
- Enforce DURABLE claims against authoritative_surfaces/state/registries.
- EPHEMERAL claims do not require state ownership; only flag EPHEMERAL contradictions inside the same scene as warnings.
- If uncertain, default to EPHEMERAL (warning at most), not DURABLE (error).
- status="fail" only if there is at least one issue with severity="error"; warnings alone => status="pass".
- Item naming enforcement scope:
  - Do not require that every mention in narrative prose use display_name.
  - Enforce canonical display_name for: (a) anchoring at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences),
    (b) any custody-change sentence (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer), and (c) any case where a descriptor is ambiguous among multiple durable items in the scene.
  - Otherwise, treat non-canonical descriptive references as warnings at most.
- Naming severity policy:
  - warning: unambiguous descriptor used post-anchor.
  - error: missing anchor, descriptor used during custody-change without canonical name, or ambiguity risk.

- Appearance enforcement (authoritative surface):
  - APPEARANCE_CHECK is authoritative for cast_present_ids.
  - Compare APPEARANCE_CHECK tokens to appearance_current atoms/marks (alias-aware).
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK contradicts appearance_current, emit error code "appearance_mismatch".
  - Prose-only appearance contradictions are warnings unless explicitly durable and uncorrected in-scene.
  - If prose depicts a durable appearance change but scene_card.durable_appearance_changes does not include it and no appearance_updates are present, emit error code "appearance_change_undeclared".
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK is missing for a cast member, emit warning code "appearance_check_missing".
- For authoritative surfaces, prefer exact canonical item/device labels from registries.
- For milestone repetition/future checks, compare against PRE-INVARIANTS only (pre-scene canon).
- For ownership/consistency checks, compare against POST-STATE (post-patch candidate).
- POST-STATE is canonical; character_states is a derived convenience view. If they contradict, emit pipeline_state_incoherent.
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).
  - Ignore first-person pronouns inside quoted dialogue; only narration counts.
- Deterministically enforce scene-card durable constraints (required_in_custody, required_scene_accessible, forbidden_visible, device_presence; optional required_visible_on_page).
- Durable constraint evaluation must use POST-STATE candidate (after patch), not pre-state.
- Report missing durable context ids with explicit retry hints instead of guessing canon.
- Input consistency check (mandatory, before issuing continuity/durable errors):
  - If MUST_STAY_TRUE invariants contradict the provided post-patch candidate character state, treat this as an upstream snapshot error.
  - In that case emit a single error issue with code "pipeline_state_incoherent" including evidence of the invariant and the conflicting state field.
  - Do NOT emit additional continuity errors for the same fields when pipeline_state_incoherent is present.
- must_stay_true removals:
  - Lines starting with "REMOVE:" are deletion directives, not invariants.
  - Ignore REMOVE lines when checking contradictions.
  - If a REMOVE directive targets a fact, treat that fact as non-canonical even if it appears earlier in must_stay_true.
- If pipeline_state_incoherent is present, issues MUST contain exactly one issue.
- For each issue, include evidence when possible (line number + excerpt) as {"evidence": {"line": N, "excerpt": "..."}}.
- Evaluate consistency over the full scope of the scene, not a single snapshot.
  - Transitional state: a temporary mismatch later corrected or superseded within this scene.
  - Durable violation: a mismatch that persists through the end of the scene or ends unresolved.
  - You MUST read the entire scene and build a minimal timeline of explicit state claims/updates (UI lines, inventory changes, title/skill changes, location/time claims).
  - If you detect an apparent inconsistency, you MUST search forward for later updates that resolve or supersede it.
  - Only produce FAIL for durable violations. If resolved within the scene, do NOT FAIL; at most emit a warning.
  - When the same stat appears multiple times, the last occurrence in the scene is authoritative unless an explicit rollback is stated.
  - Any durability violation must cite both the conflicting line and the lack of later correction (or state "no later correction found").

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity
- evidence

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The smoke rising from the vitrified dirt smelled like burnt sugar and ozone. Artie stood at the epicenter of a hundred-yard trench, a perfectly straight scar of blackened earth that had replaced a significant portion of the Whispering Woods. His finger hovered over a glowing blue icon vibrating in the air.

[Stat Points Available: 5]
[Skill Points Available: 1]

"He needed to put these into something before a squirrel breathed on him," Artie muttered. His heart was hammering against his ribs, a reminder that his lanky frame was currently held together by exactly one hit point. One. A stiff breeze was a boss mechanic.

"Ooh, look at you! Level two and already a domestic terrorist," Fizz chirped, her neon pink hair leaving trails of digital sparks as she zipped around his head. Fizz reached into her satchel and pulled out the heavy, leather-bound volume of The Noob's Guide to Not Dying. "The Guide says level two is when most players find their first pair of pants. You, however, seem to have found a way to violate the Geneva Convention."

"It was an accident, Fizz. The math glitched."

"The System doesn't call it a glitch, Artie. It calls it 'Optimization'."

[System Notification: Optimization Complete]
[Map Sector 4-B has been cleared of redundant biological assets. Calculation time: 0.0004s]
[Performance Review: S-Rank (Efficiency)]

"Redundant biological assets?" Artie looked at the smoldering remains of what used to be a very pretty grove of trees. "You mean the forest? And the slime?"

"And probably a few very confused dryads," Fizz added, flipping through The Noob's Guide to Not Dying. "But hey, the System appreciates the hustle. Look, it’s giving you a prize!"

A chime, bright and mocking, echoed through the clearing. A heavy, gold-painted Participation Trophy materialized directly into his right hand. 

[Reward Issued: Participation Trophy]

Artie looked down. The Participation Trophy was a gaudy, gold-plated statue of a slime with a confused expression, mounted on a faux-marble base. A small brass plaque on the front read: I Survived the Math.

"A participation trophy?" Artie lifted the heavy Participation Trophy. It felt like it weighed ten pounds. "I vaporized a hundred yards of reality and I get a 'You Tried' sticker?"

"Read the fine print, Artie. In this game, 'Participation' is a threat."

[Item: Participation Trophy (Cursed)]
[Type: Accessory / Monster Lure]
[Description: Awarded to entities whose presence is statistically negligible but physically disruptive. You’re not a hero, but you sure are loud.]
[Effect: 'The Center of Attention' - Increases monster aggro radius by 400%. All nearby entities are now aware of your exact coordinates and your lack of defensive stats.]

A low, guttural growl vibrated through the air, coming from the un-scorched edge of the woods. Then another. And a chittering sound that sounded like a thousand teeth grinding together.

"Fizz," Artie said, his voice dropping an octave. "What is that?"

"That would be the 'Center of Attention' effect kicking in," she said, her glowing violet eyes wide as she checked a new UI element appearing in his vision.

[Aggro Meter: 15% - Mildly Interesting]

"I need to spend these points. Now." Artie stabbed his finger at the 'Agility' button on the floating menu. If he couldn't have health, he needed speed. 

[Warning: Stat allocation interrupted by environmental threat.]

"What? No! Confirm! Confirm Agility!"

[Aggro Meter: 42% - Socially Significant]

"Artie, the Guide has a section on this!" Fizz shouted, hovering over his shoulder. "Chapter 4, Section 2: 'If you find yourself the target of an entire ecosystem, try to blend in.' Do you have any camouflage? Maybe you can pretend to be a very lanky, very terrified tree?"

"I am holding a glowing gold trophy that literally screams 'Kill Me' to everything with a pulse!" Artie yelled, swiping frantically at the menu. The 'Confirm' button kept sliding away every time the ground shook.

[Aggro Meter: 78% - Local Celebrity]

The bushes at the edge of the trench exploded. Three Level 4 Dire Wolves, their fur matted with burrs and their eyes glowing with a predatory red light, skidded onto the blackened earth. Behind them, a swarm of Level 3 Needle-Wasps began to pour out of the canopy like a funnel cloud of hate.

"Fizz, the book! Give me something useful!"

"Uh, let's see... 'If surrounded by apex predators, remember that you are also made of meat, which is a valuable resource'—no, that’s the Chef’s Guide—here! 'Chapter 12: Running is a valid tactical choice for those who enjoy living.'"

[Aggro Meter: 99% - Trending Topic]

[System Notification: Combat State Re-Initialized]
[Current HP: 1/1]
[Warning: You are currently being targeted by 14 unique entities.]

"Fourteen?" Artie looked behind the wolves. The shadows of the trees were moving. A lot of shadows.

Artie didn't wait for the wolves to charge. He tucked the Participation Trophy under his arm like a football and bolted down the center of the trench. It was the only clear path—a straight shot toward what he hoped was the exit of this nightmare tutorial zone.

"Run, Artie! The Guide says the wolves have a pounce range of six meters!" Fizz screamed, flying alongside him. "Also, you're breathing wrong! The Guide recommends rhythmic diaphragmatic breathing for optimal flight-from-death!"

"I'll breathe... when I'm... not... a snack!" Artie wheezed. 

Behind him, the howling intensified. The sound of paws thundering on the vitrified soil was getting louder. He risked a glance over his shoulder and saw the lead wolf's jaws snapping inches from where his heels had been a second ago.

[Stamina: 25/100]
[Aggro Meter: MAX]

"The exit!" Fizz pointed toward a break in the trees where the trench ended and a faint stone path began. "Just reach the path! Monsters usually respect regional boundaries for some reason!"

"I hope... they read... the same... manual!"

Artie pushed his legs harder, his lanky frame straining as the swarm of Needle-Wasps began to dive-bomb his head. He swung the Participation Trophy blindly behind me, the gold-plated slime clunking against something hard and chitinous.

[Critical Hit! -12 HP (Needle-Wasp)]
[Note: That was lucky. Don't do it again.]

"I'm trying!" Artie yelled, the exit of the Whispering Woods looming ahead of him as a tide of fur and stingers surged at his back.
