PROSE:
The white void didn't have a floor, yet Artie’s feet felt like they were resting on high-grade linoleum. It was the most comfortable he’d been since the electrical surge from the Snack-Master 4000 had turned his nervous system into a highway for angry electrons.

"Name?"

The voice was high-pitched, vibrating with the synthetic hum of a corrupted audio file. Artie blinked, squinting against the sterile radiance. A tiny figure hovered a few feet away, wings fluttering so fast they were a blur of magenta pixels. She was barely the size of a soda can, with neon pink hair and eyes that glowed like ultraviolet LEDs.

"Artie," he croaked, his throat feeling like he’d swallowed a handful of dry glitter. "Arthur Penhaligon. Am I... is this the part with the tunnel and the light?"

"You’re in the part with the paperwork and the lack of a dental plan," the sprite snapped. She waved a sparkling guide wand, and a translucent blue window snapped into existence between them. "I’m Fizz. I’m your System Guide. Usually, I handle the 'Heroic Rebirth' package, but your data is... well, it’s a dumpster fire, Artie."

[System Notification: Unique Build Detected]
[Status: Deceased (Pending) -> Initializing Life Support...]

"A dumpster fire?" Artie stepped forward, his lanky frame feeling strangely weightless. "I died over a bag of Jalapeño Hoops. I think I’ve suffered enough."

"You died because you tried to melee a vending machine with a frayed power cord," Fizz corrected, pointing her sparkling guide wand at the screen. "The System flagged your 'Last Stand' as an act of extreme statistical improbability. Specifically, that kick you landed? It was a one-in-a-billion critical hit. The math broke, and now I’m stuck trying to fit your soul into a character sheet that’s currently screaming in binary."

[Character Creation: Arthur Penhaligon]
[Available Stat Points: 50]
[Warning: Data Corruption in 'Luck' and 'Critical Rate' nodes.]

"Just give me some health," Artie said, reaching out toward the floating UI. "I don't want to die again. Especially not to office equipment."

"Careful with that!" Fizz yelped, but it was too late.

Artie’s finger brushed the screen. In the weightless environment, his clumsy poke didn't just tap a button; it dragged a slider. The 'Critical Rate' bar surged toward the right, turning a deep, threatening crimson. The 'HP' bar, conversely, shriveled until it was nothing more than a microscopic sliver of red.

[Stat Allocation Error: Overflow Detected!]
[Critical Rate: 100% (LOCKED)]
[Health Points: 1 (LOCKED)]

"What did you do?" Fizz’s neon hair flared to a bright, angry orange. She frantically waved her sparkling guide wand, trying to reset the screen, but the UI just hissed and spat out a shower of golden sparks. "You just dumped every single point into a glitched stat! You have fifty points in Crit and one—literally one—hit point!"

"Change it back!" Artie panicked, stabbing at the 'Reset' button. It grayed out instantly.

"I can't! The System just finalized the build because it thinks you’re a 'Specialized Prototype'!" Fizz grabbed a thick, leather-bound volume from her satchel, The Noob's Guide to Not Dying, and began leafing through it so fast the pages smoked. "It says here... oh, this is bad. It says 'In the event of a 100% Crit-Rate lock, the user is classified as a Glass Cannon.' But you aren't a cannon, Artie. You're a glass thimble."

[Build Finalized: The 'Crit-iculous' Specialization]
[Title Earned: Statistical Anomaly]
[Status Applied: Glitched: Crit-Only]

"One HP?" Artie stared at the tiny bar. "That's not a build. That's a death sentence. A stiff breeze could kill me. A sneeze could kill me!"

"On the bright side," Fizz said, her voice dripping with enough sarcasm to corrode the UI, "you’ll never have to worry about a long, drawn-out battle. You’ll either win in one hit, or you’ll be a very lanky smear on the floor. Now hold still. The portal is opening, and I have a quota to meet."

"Wait, I'm not ready!"

[Initializing Spawn: Tutorial Zone - Whispering Woods]
[Health: 1/1]
[Crit Rate: 100%]

"Good luck, Anomaly," Fizz muttered, tucking her sparkling guide wand into her belt as the white void began to tear open, revealing a world of vibrant, terrifying green. "You're definitely going to need it. Or at least a very sturdy bubble-wrap suit."
