Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stared through the smudged glass of the breakroom vending machine, his breath fogging the surface. \n\n\"You\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\" Artie muttered. He checked the screen. *CREDIT: $0.00*.\n\nHe looked down at his right hand, which was currently occupied by a smartphone so dead it hadn't even shown a low-battery icon in three hours. It was a glass-and-silicon brick, a useless weight that matched the general vibe of his Tuesday afternoon. He shoved the phone into his pocket\u2014no, wait, his pocket was already overflowing with the various detritus of a man who had forgotten to do laundry for two weeks. He felt the familiar, scratchy texture of a significant amount of pocket lint.\n\n[Status Effect: Caffeine Withdrawal - Level 4]\n[Status Effect: Low Blood Sugar - Irritability +15%]\n\nArtie didn't actually see those floating text boxes yet, but he felt them in the marrow of his bones. He was a level zero office drone in a world that rewarded patience with spreadsheets and loyalty with lukewarm coffee.\n\n\"Come on, you piece of junk,\" Artie said, slapping the side of the machine. The Snack-O-Matic 3000 rattled, its internal coils humming with a low-frequency buzz that sounded suspiciously like a mechanical snicker. The bag of Zesty Ranch Zings didn't budge. It just swayed, teasing him with the promise of MSG and artificial buttermilk flavoring.\n\nHe checked his surroundings. The breakroom was empty, save for a half-empty carafe of \"Morning Blend\" that had likely been brewed during the Bush administration and a single, depressing motivational poster of a cat clinging to a branch. The cat looked like it had given up years ago. Artie knew the feeling.\n\n\"Right,\" Artie whispered, rolling up his sleeves. \"Tactical intervention.\"\n\nHe gripped the top corners of the machine. According to the office lore passed down by the senior account managers, a precise rhythmic tilt could dislodge even the most stubborn of snacks. It was a high-risk, high-reward maneuver. If he tilted too far, he\u2019d be crushed by three hundred pounds of refrigerated sugar. If he didn't tilt enough, he\u2019d just look like a man trying to slow-dance with a robot.\n\nHe heaved. The machine groaned.\n\n\"One... two...\"\n\nOn three, he gave it a sharp, authoritative shove. The Snack-O-Matic rocked back on its rear legs. For a glorious, shimmering second, gravity took hold. The Zesty Ranch Zings slipped. They began to fall.\n\nAnd then, the world decided to remind Artie that he had a Luck stat of approximately zero.\n\nThe machine didn't just settle back into place. As it slammed forward, the internal wiring\u2014frayed by years of neglect and a questionable repair job involving duct tape and a paperclip\u2014decided to give up the ghost. A surge of raw, unadulterated electricity, fed by a faulty circuit breaker and a sudden spike in the building\u2019s power grid, surged through the metal chassis.\n\nArtie\u2019s hands were still firmly planted on the frame.\n\n*CRACK-THOOM.*\n\nThe sound was less like an electrical pop and more like a localized thunderclap. Blue light, jagged and hungry, arced across Artie\u2019s vision. He felt a sensation like being hit by a freight train made of needles. His muscles locked. His heart, usually a reliable if somewhat sluggish organ, decided to take an indefinite sabbatical.\n\n*Oh,* Artie thought, the logic center of his brain functioning for one final, crystal-clear millisecond. *I\u2019m dying over a bag of chips. This is going to be a very embarrassing obituary.*\n\nThe smell of ozone and burnt polyester filled the air. Artie felt himself being flung backward, his feet leaving the linoleum floor. The world didn't fade to black; it shattered into a million glowing pixels. The fluorescent lights of the breakroom stretched into infinity, becoming long ribbons of white fire. \n\nHe hit the ground, but he didn't feel the impact. He didn't feel the cold floor or the lingering sting of the shock. He felt... nothing. A profound, weightless emptiness swallowed him whole. The hum of the vending machine vanished, replaced by a silence so absolute it was deafening.\n\nHe was floating in a void. No up, no down, no Zesty Ranch Zings. Just a vast, shimmering expanse of darkness that felt less like death and more like a loading screen.\n\nArtie tried to scream, but he had no lungs. He tried to look at his hands, but he was just a flickering spark of consciousness in the dark. \n\nThen, the silence broke.\n\nA chime, melodic and irritatingly cheerful, echoed through the emptiness. It was the sound of a successful boot-up sequence. \n\nIn the center of his non-existent vision, a box of glowing blue light materialized.\n\n[System Notification]\n[Critical Error Detected: Player 'Arthur Penhaligon' has experienced a fatal hardware failure (Heart.exe stopped responding).]\n\n\"Hardware failure?\" Artie\u2019s thought-voice echoed. \"I was electrocuted by a Snack-O-Matic!\"\n\n[Analyzing cause of death...]\n[Result: Death by Ranch-Induced Electrocution.

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nIf mechanics are shown in prose or UI, they must be present in continuity system state or added in continuity system updates in the same STATE_PATCH.\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to

No recap.\n- Summaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\n- Use the continuity pack and state for continuity.\n- Use character_registry to keep names consistent in prose.\n- Timeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\n- State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\n- Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n- Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\n- Inventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- For held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\n- Continuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates in this scene.\n- titles are arrays of objects with stable name fields; do not emit titles as plain strings.\n- Canonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\n- If item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for ownership/custody labels in authoritative outputs.\n- If a required event is not in the Scene Card, do not perform it.\n- Enforce scene-card durable constraints: honor `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, and `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\n- Respect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope` when proposing durable mutations; do not mutate physical custody in non-present/non-real scope unless explicitly marked override.\n- summary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\n- STATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\n- If state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\n- Return prose plus a state_patch JSON block.\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n- Durable-state mutation blocks are mandatory when applicable:\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.\n- If you mutate durable state, do not leave the same mutation only in prose.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n  - Each entry must include character_id, chapter, scene, inventory (full current list), containers (full current list), invariants_add (array), persona_updates (array).\n  - If you have a single persona update, still wrap it in an array of strings.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger and invariants using standard phrasing, e.g.:\n  - Avoid numeric mechanics in must_stay_true;

I checked the floating red bar hovering above its translucent, jiggly head. \n\n[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 3] [HP: 45/45]\n\nForty-five health. At my current Strength of 12, with a base weapon damage of 4-6, I was looking at a nine-hit kill minimum, assuming the RNG gods didn't decide to spit on my shoes today. \n\n\"You know,\" I said, adjusting my grip on the rusted shortsword. \"In most worlds, puddles are for stepping in, not for getting dissolved by.\"\n\nThe slime responded by launching a glob of corrosive mucus. I rolled left, the grass staining my knees.\n\n[Stamina: 88/100]\n\n\"Missed me. Barely. That\u2019s a three-second cooldown on your spit, isn't it?\"\n\nI didn't wait for the confirmation. I lunged. The blade sank into the gelatinous mass with a sound like a heavy boot pulling out of thick mud.\n\n[Critical Hit! -14 HP]\n\n\"There we go.

My lungs burned slightly, a reminder that my Agility was still garbage. \n\n[Passive Skill Gained: Basic Analysis (Rank F)]\n[Description: You can see basic stats and cooldowns of enemies within 5 meters. You\u2019ve stopped guessing and started counting. Good for you.]\n\n\"Finally,\" I breathed, dodging another glob. \"The ding is coming. I can practically taste the experience points. They taste like copper and bad decisions.\" \n\nI swung again, the numbers popping in the air like neon confetti. This wasn't just a fight; it was a grind.
