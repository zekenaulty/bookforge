PROSE:

The floor of the Inner Sanctum didn't just tilt; it shrieked, a tectonic groan of marble shearing away from the Spire’s central spine. Kaelen slammed his boots against the base of a heavy oak lectern, his right arm vibrating with a frequency that threatened to liquefy the marrow. The pewter filament woven into his radius bone ground against the inner surface of the cortex, a rhythmic, white-hot agony that mirrored the *thump-hiss* of the star-shard in his satchel.

Across the sloping chamber, Commander Varkas stood at an impossible angle. He wasn't bracing himself. He was anchored by the bruised violet light bleeding from the fracture in his chest, his boots fused to the stone by crystalline growths. The man who had taught Kaelen the first tenets of the Oath was gone, replaced by a hollowed-out vessel of star-glass and void-shadow. Varkas’s eyes were no longer human; they were twin pits of violet event horizons, swirling with the same sickly luminescence that had turned the valley floor to razor-glass.

"The maps, Kaelen," Varkas said. His voice was a discordant harmony, two tones overlapping—one familiar and gravelly, the other a high, crystalline chime. "Leave them. The stars do not need to be charted. They need to be felt."

Varkas raised a hand. The air in the sanctum turned brittle, the temperature plummeting until Kaelen’s breath came in ragged, frozen puffs that scorched his throat. A lash of violet energy whipped across the room, shattering the remaining display cases. Kaelen dived behind the central archive table, the scent of scorched copper and ozone filling his lungs. 

He reached into his satchel, his fingers brushing the star-shard. The moment of contact sent a jolt of ice-water through his nervous system. The shard didn't just pulse; it pulled. It wanted the corruption in Varkas. It wanted to consume the very thing that had hollowed out his commander.

"You're not him," Kaelen hissed, his teeth aching from the cold. "Varkas died when the first ward broke."

"Varkas was a jailer," the thing in the commander's skin replied. "I am the key."

The table between them disintegrated. Not into splinters, but into fine, violet dust that hung in the air, defiant of gravity. Kaelen lunged forward, his boots skidding on the frost-slicked marble. He drew his short-blade, but he didn't aim for the heart. He knew there was nothing left there but glass. He aimed for the throat, for the place where the pewter filament of Varkas’s own Oath-binding was visible beneath the translucent, purple-veined skin.

Varkas moved with a fluid, terrifying speed, his arm snapping out to catch Kaelen’s wrist. The contact was like grabbing a frozen iron bar. Frost-burn bloomed instantly across Kaelen’s forearm, the skin turning the color of a bruised plum. 

Kaelen roared, not in pain, but in a desperate attempt to force the shard’s resonance through his own arm. He opened the gates of his Oath, letting the unstable essence of the star-shard flood the pewter filament in his bone. The reaction was violent. A metallic scent, sharp and biting, filled the air as the filament heated to a dull glow. 

The resonance clash sent a shockwave through the room. The stained-glass windows above the archives exploded outward, the shards caught in the Spire's tilting gravity and pulled into the abyss below. Varkas recoiled, his violet eyes flickering. For a second, the commander’s true face surfaced—a mask of absolute, unadulterated terror.

"Kaelen... stop..."

"I can't," Kaelen choked out, his lungs feeling as if they were filled with liquid lead. "The Oath is broken, Commander. You broke it."

Kaelen twisted the blade, the edge catching on the crystalline growths on Varkas’s chest. He didn't pull back. He pushed. He drove the shard’s hunger directly into the commander’s core. The *thump-hiss* reached a deafening crescendo, a rhythmic thrumming that shook the very foundations of the Spire.

Varkas’s body began to fracture. Lines of brilliant, blinding violet light spiderwebbed across his skin. The star-glass in his chest hummed, then shattered. The explosion wasn't outward, but inward—a sudden, violent vacuum that pulled the air from Kaelen’s lungs and the light from the room. 

Varkas collapsed, his form dissolving into a heap of dull, gray ash and jagged violet shards. The pressure in the room vanished, replaced by the howling wind of the storm outside. 

Kaelen slumped against the archive rack, his right arm hanging limp and blackened by starwrought scarring. His breath hitched, each inhale a battle against the frost-burn in his chest. He couldn't stay. The floor gave another sickening lurch, the angle now so steep that the heavy archive racks began to slide toward the shattered windows.

He scrambled toward the central dais. There, inside a reinforced brass cylinder etched with the constellations of the Old Era, lay the Star-Maps. He grabbed the cylinder, the metal freezing to his palm, and shoved it into his satchel alongside the pulsing shard. 

The Spire groaned one last time—a final, terminal sound of structural failure. The ceiling began to rain dust and debris. Kaelen didn't look back at the remains of his commander. He turned toward the archway leading to the outer battlements, his boots finding purchase on the crumbling stone as he began a desperate, uphill sprint toward the only exit left.
