PROSE:

The stone archway of the Low-Level Crypts didn't so much welcome Artie as it did provide a convenient frame for his inevitable demise. He stood at the threshold, the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion pulsing with a neon yellow radiance so aggressive it made the ancient, moss-covered stones look like they were at a bad rave. 

"Is the glow strictly necessary?" Artie whispered, his voice echoing off the damp walls. He clutched the Participation Trophy in his left hand, the golden plastic wings of the "award" catching the cloak’s garish light. "I feel like a walking 'Kill Me' sign. Which, considering my health bar, is redundant."

[Aggro Meter: 99% (CRITICAL DENSITY)]

"It’s not just a sign, Artie. It’s a lighthouse for the unliving," Fizz said, her tiny blue form flickering as she hovered near his ear. She left a trail of pixelated dust in the air. "The Cloak of the Cowardly Lion provides a massive evasion boost, but the trade-off is that every monster within three zip codes knows exactly where you are and what you’re wearing. Also, you look ridiculous."

"Thanks for the fashion critique, Fizz. I’ll be sure to mention it in my obituary," Artie muttered. He took a step forward, his sneakers squeaking on the stone floor. 

The interior of the crypt was a masterpiece of budget-friendly dungeon design: flickering torches, the smell of wet calcium, and a floor plan that seemed to have been designed by someone who hated straight lines. As Artie rounded the first corner, the "lighthouse" effect of his cloak hit its first customers.

Three skeletons, their bones bleached a dull grey, rattled to life in a nearby alcove. They didn't have eyes, but they certainly had a focus. They turned in unison, their jawbones clicking.

[Aggro Meter: 100% (MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE)]
[Warning: You have entered the detection radius of: Crypt Skirmisher (Lvl 4) x3]

"Oh, look, fans," Artie said, his heart hammering against his ribs. He had 1 HP. If one of those rusted scimitars so much as grazed his Corporate ID Badge, he was going to be a very flat, very dead office drone.

The first skeleton lunged. It was a clumsy, overhead swing that should have been easy to avoid, but Artie’s feet felt like they were glued to the floor. Then, the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion twitched.

A sudden, violent jerk pulled Artie’s torso three inches to the right. The scimitar whistled past his ear, cutting through the space where his head had been a millisecond prior.

[Evasion Proc! (Cloak of the Cowardly Lion)]
[Status: Coward's Shame (Active) - Your dignity has decreased, but your life has not.]

"Whoa!" Artie stumbled, his body moving with a twitchy, involuntary grace. "The cloak... it just moved me. I didn't even think about it."

"That’s the 'Coward's Shame' in action," Fizz chirped, dodging a stray rib bone. "It bypasses your sluggish human reflexes and replaces them with pure, unadulterated terror-based automation. Don't think, Artie. Just... vibrate."

The second skeleton stepped forward, thrusting its blade. Artie’s knees buckled—not from fear, but because the cloak forced him into a deep, undignified squat. The blade passed over his head.

[Evasion Proc! (Cloak of the Cowardly Lion)]

"This is humiliating," Artie said, his face inches from the dusty floor. He saw the third skeleton preparing to strike. It was drawing back its arm in a slow, deliberate arc.

Wait.

Artie watched the skeleton’s feet. *Clack-clack. Pause. Clack-clack. Pause.*

The skeleton swung. Artie didn't wait for the cloak to jerk him this time. He stepped left on the *Pause*. The scimitar struck the wall with a shower of sparks.

"Fizz, did you see that?" Artie asked, his eyes narrowing as he watched the trio reset. 

"See what? Your life flashing before your eyes? I’ve seen it three times in the last minute," she replied.

"No. The timing. They’re... they’re on a beat."

The skeletons moved again. It was a synchronized dance of decay. *Step-step-swing. Step-step-swing.* It was exactly like the rhythm of the data entry software Artie had used for six years—a predictable, looping sequence of inputs.

"One, two, three, dodge," Artie whispered. He watched the first skeleton. *One, two, three...* He stepped back. The blade missed by a mile. He didn't even need the evasion proc.

"It’s a rhythm game," Artie realized, a manic grin spreading across his face. "This isn't combat. It’s *Dance Dance Revolution* with higher stakes and worse music."

[Skill Gained: Pattern Recognition (Rank G)]
[Description: You’ve realized that the world is just a series of predictable loops. Congratulations on being slightly more observant than a rock.]

"Okay, boys," Artie said, adjusting his grip on the Participation Trophy. "Let’s see if you can keep up with the tempo."

He stepped into the center of the three skeletons. *One, two, three, pivot.* He spun, the neon yellow cloak flaring out like a radioactive tutu. A scimitar passed under his arm. *One, two, three, slide.* He glided past the second skeleton, his sneakers chirping on the stone. 

[Evasion Proc!]
[Evasion Proc!]
[Evasion Proc!]

The damage numbers didn't appear because nothing was hitting him. Instead, the air was filled with the sound of rusted metal hitting stone and the frantic clicking of skeleton teeth.

"You’re actually doing it," Fizz said, sounding genuinely surprised. "You’re gaming the system by... counting?"

"In my old life, I processed four thousand spreadsheets a week, Fizz. I know a loop when I see one," Artie said. He ducked under a horizontal slash, his neon glow illuminating the frustrated movements of the undead. "These guys are running on a 120-BPM combat script. It’s almost insulting."

He began to hum a jaunty, synthesized tune under his breath, matching his steps to the skeletons' clacking bones. He was no longer a fugitive; he was the conductor of a very boney orchestra. 

"Next stop, the boss," Artie said, sliding between the last two skeletons and heading deeper into the crypt. "I hope he likes techno."
