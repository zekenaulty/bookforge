In front of Artie, the air rippled, and a heavy, metallic object materialized with a thud. It was a trophy\u2014a cheap-looking, gold-plated plastic cup mounted on a base of simulated marble. It glowed with a sickly, neon-purple light that seemed to pulse in time with Artie\u2019s heartbeat.\n\n[Item Acquired: Participation Trophy]\n[Quality: Trash (Cursed)]\n[Description: Congratulations!

The moment his fingers closed around it, the purple glow intensified, shooting a beam of light straight into the sky like a flare.\n\n\"Oh, that's not good,\" Fizz said, her voice dropping an octave. \"That\u2019s really, really not good.\"\n\n\"Why is it glowing, Fizz?

Hundreds\u2014no, thousands\u2014of Lesser Green Slimes were cresting the ridge. They weren't wobbling aimlessly anymore. They were moving with a terrifying, synchronized purpose, their translucent bodies glistening under the purple light of the Participation Trophy.\n\n\"Run?\" Artie asked, his voice cracking.\n\n\"Run,\" Fizz confirmed.\n\nArtie didn't wait for a second opinion. He bolted. He sprinted down the scorched trench, the Participation Trophy clutched tightly in his right hand. Every time the trophy struck his thigh, it emitted a high-pitched *ping* that seemed to act as a homing signal. \n\nBehind him, the Slime Fields had turned into a literal sea of green. The sound of their collective movement was a wet, squelching roar. \n\n[Warning: Stamina Depleting]\n[Stamina: 45/100]\n\n\"Put the trophy away!\" Artie wheezed, his mousy brown hair plastered to his forehead with sweat.\n\n\"You can't!\" Fizz shouted, flying alongside his head. \"It\u2019s soul-bound and 'Always-Equipped' until you reach a Safe Zone. It\u2019s part of the curse! You\u2019re the shiny new toy, Artie, and the toddlers are coming to play!\"\n\nHe looked back. The lead slimes were gaining. They were launching themselves through the air in long, parabolic arcs, their bodies stretching into lethal green teardrops. One landed inches from his heels, the impact cratering the soft earth. \n\nArtie swerved, nearly tripping over a protruding root. His 1 HP build meant that if even a single drop of that acidic slime touched his skin, the \"Glass Soul\" condition would shatter his existence. He was a Level 3 god of destruction who could be killed by a stray sneeze.\n\n\"The gate!\" Fizz screamed, pointing toward a distant stone archway flickering on the edge of the zone. \"Oakhaven!

    "system": "\ufeff# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nUI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says \"always include\".\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true. If a prior invariant is stale or superseded, you MUST flag it for removal using \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" before restating the current truth.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v2\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\":

        "content": "# REPAIR\n\nFix the scene based on lint issues.\nSummaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\nTimeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: pre-scene invariants and summary facts are binding unless the Scene Card depicts a change. If this scene changes a durable fact, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value and remove the old entry.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n\n- must_stay_true removal (mandatory when a durable fact is superseded):\n  - Add \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" in summary_update.must_stay_true.\n  - Place REMOVE lines before the new final invariant.\n  - REMOVE lines also apply to key_facts_ring (purge stale facts from continuity).\n\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- Inventory posture reconciliation:\n  - If inventory/containers change (held/stowed/container), must_stay_true must be updated to the final posture.\n  - Add REMOVE lines for prior inventory/container invariants before the new final entries.\n  - Use canonical invariant formats:\n    - inventory: CHAR_X -> <item display_name> (status=held|carried|equipped|stowed, container=hand_left|hand_right|<container>)\n    - container: <container> (owner=CHAR_X, contents=[<item display_name>, ...])\nFor held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\nContinuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.\n- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.\n- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.\n- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI gate: only include bracketed UI blocks when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If false, remove or rephrase UI blocks into narrative prose.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or a short parenthetical annotation (e.g., (locked), (Warning: ...)).\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nCanonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\nIf item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for authoritative labels and custody terms.\nUse item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If a durable appearance change occurs in this scene, record it in character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- APPEARANCE_CHECK is required in COMPLIANCE for each cast_present_id (4-8 tokens from atoms/marks).\n\nNaming repairs:\n- If lint flags an item naming issue, fix it with minimal edits.\n- Do not remove humor; simply anchor the item (add display_name near first mention) and ensure custody-change sentences include the display_name.\n- Do not rename item_id or registry fields; only adjust prose wording.\nsummary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\nSTATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\nmust_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\nIf state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\nEnforce scene-card durable constraints: `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\nRespect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`.\n\n- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):\n  - If timeline_scope != \"present\" OR ontological_scope != \"real\", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).\n  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.\n  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category=\"timeline_override\".\n\nReturn corrected prose plus a corrected state_patch JSON block.\n\nOutput format (required, no code fences, no commentary):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n\nAPPEARANCE_CHECK:\n- CHAR_ID: <4-8 tokens from atoms/marks>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects.

Never use null.\n    - INVALID: \"custodian\": null\n    - VALID: \"custodian\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\" or \"world\"\n  - owner_scope must be \"character\" or \"world\" and must match the custodian scope.\n  - plot_device_updates: set must include name, custody_scope, custody_ref, activation_state, linked_threads, constraints, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n\n- Transfer vs registry conflict rule (must follow):\n  - If you create a NEW item in item_registry_updates with final custodian already set (e.g., CHAR_ARTIE), DO NOT emit transfer_updates for that item.\n  - If you emit transfer_updates for a NEW item, the registry entry must start with custodian=\"world\" and then transfer to the character.\n  - expected_before must match the registry entry at the moment of transfer (after any registry update that applies before it).  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects; never an object with an `updates` field.\n\n  - inventory_alignment_updates[*].set MUST be an object (not a list).\n    - INVALID: \"set\": []\n    - VALID:   \"set\": {\"inventory\": [...], \"containers\": [...]}\n- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.\n- If you mutate durable state, do not leave the same mutation only in prose.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n- appearance_updates: when a durable appearance change happens, include appearance_updates on the relevant character_updates entry.\n\n  - appearance_updates MUST be an object, not an array.\n    - INVALID: \"appearance_updates\": [{\"set\": {...}, \"reason\": \"...\"}]\n    - VALID: \"appearance_updates\": {\"set\": {\"marks_add\": [{\"name\": \"Singed Hair\", \"location\": \"head\", \"durability\": \"durable\"}]}, \"reason\": \"...\"}\n\n  - appearance_updates.set may include atoms and marks only (canonical truth).\n    - Do NOT put marks_add at the top level; it belongs under set.\n    - Use set.marks_add / set.marks_remove for marks changes.\n    - Use set.atoms for atom changes.\n  - appearance_updates.reason is required (brief, factual).\n  - Do NOT set summary or art text in appearance_updates (derived after acceptance)\n  - Each entry must include character_id, chapter, scene, inventory (full current list), containers (full current list), invariants_add (array), persona_updates (array).\n  - character_updates.inventory MUST be an array of objects, never string item ids.\n  - Inventory object shape: {\"item\": \"ITEM_or_name\", \"container\": \"hand_left|hand_right|<container>\", \"status\": \"held|carried|equipped|stowed\"}.\n  - Container object shape: {\"container\": \"<name>\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_id\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_id\", \"...\"]}.\n  - If you have a single persona update, still wrap it in an array of strings.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger and invariants using standard phrasing, e.g.:\n  - Avoid numeric mechanics in must_stay_true; store them in continuity system updates instead.\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> shard (carried, container=satchel)\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> longsword (carried, container=hand_right)\n  - container: satchel (owner=CHAR_example, contents=[shard, maps])\n  - milestone: shard_bind = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - milestone: maps_acquired = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - injury: right forearm scar / left arm filament\n  - ownership: shard (carried) / shard (bound but physical)\n\nIssues:\n[\n  {\n    \"code\": \"prose_hygiene\",\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"excerpt\": \"He sprinted down the scorched trench, the Participation Trophy clutched tightly in his hand_right.\",\n      \"line\": 46\n    },\n    \"message\": \"Internal container code 'hand_right' used in narrative prose.

legally a weapon of mass destruction. He stood in the center of a scorched, blackened trench, his chest heaving. Every breath felt like dragging a wire brush through his lungs, but his HP bar remained a steady, terrifying 1/1.\n\n\"Well,\" Fizz chirped, fluttering down from a safe distance. She hovered just outside the lingering heat haze, her pixelated wings shimmering. \"That was certainly... a choice. Most people use a sword. You used a glitch in the fundamental laws of mathematics.\"\n\nArtie wiped soot from his forehead, leaving a dark smear across his pale skin. \"I didn't mean to delete the geography, Fizz. I just wanted the slime to stop looking at me like I was a snack.\"\n\n[Quest Complete: Tutorial Combat 101]\n[Reward: Overkill Bonus Calculated...]\n[Processing... Processing... System Error: Math.div(0) avoided by rounding up to 'Absurd'.]\n\nA chime like a broken xylophone echoed through the fields. In front of Artie, the air rippled, and a heavy, metallic object materialized with a thud. It was a trophy\u2014a cheap-looking, gold-plated plastic cup mounted on a base of simulated marble. It glowed with a sickly, neon-purple light that seemed to pulse in time with Artie\u2019s heartbeat.\n\n[Item Acquired: Participation Trophy]\n[Quality: Trash (Cursed)]\n[Description: Congratulations! You broke the tutorial. This item serves as a permanent beacon for every monster in the zone who feels personally insulted by your existence.]\n\nArtie reached down and gripped the cold, vibrating stem of the Participation Trophy with his right hand. The moment his fingers closed around it, the purple glow intensified, shooting a beam of light straight into the sky like a flare.\n\n\"Oh, that's not good,\" Fizz said, her voice dropping an octave. \"That\u2019s really, really not good.\"\n\n\"Why is it glowing, Fizz? Why is my reward a lighthouse for murder?\"\n\n[System Notification: Level Up!]\n[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon has reached Level 3!]\n[Stat Points Gained: 5 (Held for anomaly verification)]\n\nArtie didn't have time to celebrate the 'ding.' A low, rhythmic thrumming began to vibrate through the soles of his shoes. It wasn't the wind. It was the sound of ten thousand gelatinous bodies hitting the grass at once.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 100% (MAXIMUM)]\n[Zone Alert: Slime Migration Inbound. Current Target: Statistical Anomaly #001.]\n\n\"Artie,\" Fizz said, her tiny blue hands pointing toward the horizon. \"You remember how I said the slimes were passive unless provoked?\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"You just provoked the entire ecosystem.\"\n\nOn the crest of the surrounding hills, the green horizon began to bulge. Hundreds\u2014no, thousands\u2014of Lesser Green Slimes were cresting the ridge. They weren't wobbling aimlessly anymore. They were moving with a terrifying, synchronized purpose, their translucent bodies glistening under the purple light of the Participation Trophy.\n\n\"Run?\" Artie asked, his voice cracking.\n\n\"Run,\" Fizz confirmed.\n\nArtie didn't wait for a second opinion. He bolted. He sprinted down the scorched trench, the Participation Trophy clutched tightly in his hand_right. Every time the trophy struck his thigh, it emitted a high-pitched *ping* that seemed to act as a homing signal. \n\nBehind him, the Slime Fields had turned into a literal sea of green. The sound of their collective movement was a wet, squelching roar. \n\n[Warning: Stamina Depleting]\n[Stamina: 45/100]\n\n\"Put the trophy away!\" Artie wheezed, his mousy brown hair plastered to his forehead with sweat.\n\n\"You can't!\" Fizz shouted, flying alongside his head. \"It\u2019s soul-bound and 'Always-Equipped' until you reach a Safe Zone. It\u2019s part of the curse! You\u2019re the shiny new toy, Artie, and the toddlers are coming to play!\"\n\nHe looked back. The lead slimes were gaining. They were launching themselves through the air in long, parabolic arcs, their bodies stretching into lethal green teardrops. One landed inches from his heels, the impact cratering the soft earth. \n\nArtie swerved, nearly tripping over a protruding root. His 1 HP build meant that if even a single drop of that acidic slime touched his skin, the \"Glass Soul\" condition would shatter his existence. He was a Level 3 god of destruction who could be killed by a stray sneeze.\n\n\"The gate!\" Fizz screamed, pointing toward a distant stone archway flickering on the edge of the zone. \"Oakhaven! If you cross the threshold, the zone-aggro resets!\"\n\n\"How far?\" Artie gasped.\n\n[Distance to Oakhaven Gate: 400 Meters]\n[Slime Proximity: 12 Meters and Closing]\n\n\"I hate this game!\" Artie yelled, his lungs burning as he pushed his slender frame to its absolute limit. \"I want a refund! I want to talk to the manager!\"\n\n[System Response: Manager is currently busy laughing. Please hold your Participation Trophy higher so the slimes can see it better.]\n\nThe purple light flared again, blindingly bright, as the first wave of slimes prepared to leap.\n\nState:\n{\n
