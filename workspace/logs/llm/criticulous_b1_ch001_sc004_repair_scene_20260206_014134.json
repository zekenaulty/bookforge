It was a translucent, lime-green wobbling mass that looked like it had been harvested from the bottom of a cafeteria Jell-O tray. It didn't have teeth, it didn't have claws, and it moved with the urgent speed of a glacier on a coffee break. But to Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon, this wobbling puddle of citrus-flavored malice was the Grim Reaper in gelatinous form.\n\nArtie\u2019s back was pressed hard against the rough, furrowed bark of a massive oak tree. The tree was a titan of the Tutorial Zone, its branches sprawling like the veins of the earth against the digital blue of the sky. It felt solid. It felt permanent. It was the only thing keeping Artie from collapsing into a heap of existential dread.\n\n[Lesser Forest Slime - Lvl 1]\n[HP: 10/10]\n[Attack: 2]\n\nThe floating red text above the creature was a death sentence. Artie looked down at his own status bar, hovering in the periphery of his vision like a nagging headache.\n\n[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]\n[HP: 1/1]\n\n\"Two damage,\" Artie whispered, his voice cracking. \"It does two damage. I have one hit point. I am literally a soap bubble in a world made of needles.\"\n\nThe slime rippled. A wet, rhythmic *thwack-thwack-thwack* echoed through the clearing as it compressed its body, preparing to lunge. Artie gripped the hilt of his weapon. The Rusty Shortsword (Prop) felt exactly like what its name suggested: a piece of painted plastic and cheap foam that had been left in a damp basement for a decade. The 'Prop' tag wasn't just a descriptor; it was a warning that the System didn't consider this a real weapon.\n\n\"Okay, Artie. You were a data analyst. You deal in probabilities. You have a one-hundred percent critical hit rate. The math is on your side,\" he lied to himself. His palms were sweating, making the grip of the sword slick and unreliable. \"You just have to touch it. One touch, and the math does the rest.\"\n\nThe slime launched. It didn't so much leap as it did undergo a sudden, violent change in state from 'puddle' to 'projectile.' It sailed through the air, a wobbling green sphere of doom aimed directly at Artie\u2019s chest.\n\n\"Get back!\" Artie roared, swinging the rusted blade in a wide, desperate arc.\n\nThe sword whistled through the air. Artie felt the weight of the swing, saw the blade pass directly through the center of the slime\u2019s translucent mass. He braced for the impact, for the spray of green goo, for the sweet satisfaction of a kill.\n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe word appeared in bright, mocking yellow text right where the slime should have been. The creature sailed past Artie\u2019s shoulder, its sticky surface missing his tunic by a fraction of an inch. It hit the ground with a sound like a wet beanbag and immediately began to turn around.\n\n\"What? I hit that! I saw the blade go through it!\" Artie screamed at the sky. \"The collision detection in this place is garbage! I want to speak to a developer!\"\n\nThe System did not respond with a developer. It responded with the slime compressing itself again.\n\nArtie didn't wait for the next lunge. He stepped forward, determined to end this before his heart gave out from sheer terror. He raised the sword high above his head and brought it down in a vertical chop, a move he\u2019d seen a thousand times in RPGs. The slime was stationary, recovering from its landing. It was a sitting duck. A sitting lime.\n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe sword didn't hit the slime. It didn't even hit the ground where the slime was. Instead, the blade seemed to deflect off an invisible curved surface, sliding to the left and burying itself deep into a protruding root of the oak tree. The jar of the impact traveled up Artie\u2019s arm, making his elbow scream in protest.\n\n\"Two!\" Artie gasped, tugging at the sword. It was stuck. \"That\u2019s two! How can I miss a target that isn't even moving? I\u2019m standing right on top of it!\"\n\nThe slime didn't care about his frustrations. It lunged again, this time aiming for his knees. Artie panicked, yanking the sword free with a burst of adrenaline-fueled strength and jumping backward. He swung the blade blindly as he moved, a horizontal lash meant to keep the monster at bay.\n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe slime flattened itself into a pancake, the rusted metal passing harmlessly over its gelatinous 'head.' It looked up at him\u2014or at least, it oriented its mass toward him\u2014with what Artie could only interpret as smug satisfaction.\n\n\"Three,\" Artie whimpered. He was breathing hard now, the air in the Tutorial Zone tasting like ozone and pine needles. \"The System is rigging the rolls. It has to be. It gave me the crit rate, but it\u2019s nerfing my accuracy to compensate. It\u2019s a balance patch in real-time!\"\n\nHe was backed against the tree again. The slime was circling him now, its movements becoming more fluid, more confident. It knew he was a glass cannon. It knew that one mistake, one slip of the foot, and Arthur Penhaligon would be a memory.\n\nThe slime launched a fourth time. It was a high, looping jump, designed to come down on Artie from above. He saw it coming. He timed it. He lunged forward with a thrust, aiming the tip of the 'Prop' sword at the very center of the falling green mass.\n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe sword slid off the slime\u2019s side as if the creature were coated in industrial-grade Teflon. The momentum carried Artie forward, and he nearly face-planted into the grass. He scrambled back to the tree, his legs shaking.\n\n\"Four! That\u2019s four misses!\" he yelled, his voice rising to a hysterical pitch. \"I am a statistical impossibility! I am the one-percent of the one-percent! I am the king of the whiff!\"\n\nThe slime was preparing its final assault. It began to vibrate, its green hue deepening to a dark, bruised emerald. The ground beneath it seemed to hum with gathered energy. This wasn't just a lunge; it was a 'Heavy Attack.'\n\nArtie looked at the sword. It was a joke. He looked at the slime. It was a killer. He looked at the oak tree. It was a witness.\n\n\"One more,\" Artie whispered. \"Just give me one hit.\"\n\nThe slime exploded off the ground. It moved faster than before, a blur of green malice. Artie swung with everything he had left. He didn't aim for the center. He didn't aim for the edges. He just swung at the space where the monster was.\n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe sword hit a low-hanging branch of the oak tree, snapping it clean off. The branch fell, bouncing off Artie\u2019s shoulder and landing in the dirt. It didn't do damage, but it was the final, crushing weight on his spirit.\n\n\"Five,\" Artie said, his eyes wide. The slime was inches from his face, its translucent body expanding as it prepared to engulf him. \"I missed five times. This is it. I\u2019m going to be killed by a dessert.\"\n\nTime slowed down. It was a classic trope, the moment of clarity before the end. He could see the individual air bubbles trapped inside the slime. He could see the way the sunlight refracted through its body, casting a green glow on his own terrified face. He could see the 'Attack: 2' text hovering like a neon sign.\n\nAnd then, something in the back of Artie\u2019s mind\u2014the part that had spent years analyzing spreadsheets and finding the one outlier in a sea of data\u2014clicked.\n\nThe 100% Critical Hit Rate wasn't a stat. It was a law. And the System, for all its snark and its 'Prop' swords, was bound by its own laws. The misses weren't failures of skill; they were the System trying to delay the inevitable. But the math had reached its limit. The probability had collapsed into a single, unavoidable point.\n\nArtie didn't swing. He didn't even move his arm. He just let his wrist twitch. A tiny, insignificant flick of the rusted blade. A glitch in the animation of his own despair.\n\nThe tip of the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) touched the very edge of the slime.\n\nThe world didn't just end; it was rewritten.\n\n[SUPER-MEGA-ULTRA-CRIT!]\n\nThe sound was not a physical noise. It was the sound of a billion calculators screaming in unison. A pillar of pure, blinding golden light erupted from the point of contact, a column of celestial fire that reached from the scorched grass to the very top of the skybox.\n\nThe Level 1 Lesser Forest Slime didn't die. It didn't even have time to trigger a death animation. It was simply deleted. Its pixels were torn apart, its data scrubbed from the local memory, its very existence turned into a cloud of glowing green vapor that was instantly incinerated by the heat of the crit.\n\nBut the crit wasn't satisfied with one level-one mob.\n\nThe energy wave hit the oak tree. The hundred-year-old giant, the titan of the Tutorial Zone, vanished. There was no sound of splintering wood, no groan of falling timber. There was only a roar of displaced air as the tree was reduced to ash and light in a fraction of a second. The shockwave expanded, carving a perfect, circular crater into the earth, twenty feet wide and ten feet deep. The edges of the pit were glassed, glowing with a dull, angry red heat.\n\nArtie was thrown backward, but the System\u2019s physics\u2014or perhaps its sheer confusion\u2014kept him on his feet. He stood on the edge of the smoking ruin, his arm still raised, the 'Prop' sword glowing with a faint, dying ember of gold.\n\nSilence returned to the forest. It was a heavy, unnatural silence, broken only by the sound of a few stray leaves that had survived the blast fluttering down into the crater.\n\nThen, the notifications began to scroll.\n\n[System Notification]\n[Target: Lesser Forest Slime (Lvl 1) - DEFEATED]\n[Damage Dealt: 9,999,999 (Overkill)]\n[Experience Gained: 50 XP]\n\n[Level Up!]\n[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon: Level 1 -> Level 2]\n[Stat Points Gained: 5]\n[Note: Please try to leave some of the environment for the other players. The janitorial sub-routines are complaining about the sudden increase in 'Ash-Related' tickets.]\n\nArtie stood there, his mouth hanging open. He looked at the crater. He looked at the empty space where a massive tree had been seconds ago. He looked at the sword in his hand, which was still rusted, still cheap, and still labeled as a 'Prop.'\n\n\"I...\" Artie started, his voice a dry, hacking rasp. He swallowed hard. \"I think I might be a little bit broken.\"\n\nHe checked his status bar.\n\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Level: 2]\n\nHe was still one stiff breeze away from death. He was still a glass cannon. But he had just deleted a piece of the world's geometry because he\u2019d finally stopped missing.\n\n\"Level two,\" he breathed, a hysterical, high-pitched laugh bubbling up in his throat. \"I\u2019m level two. And all it took was the total destruction of a local ecosystem.\"\n\nHe sat down on the edge of the crater, his legs finally giving out. The dirt was still warm, the heat seeping through his trousers. He reached into his pocket, feeling the familiar, comforting weight of his dead smartphone and his wallet. They were relics of a world where slimes didn't exist and trees didn't turn into light.\n\n\"Okay,\" Artie said to the empty, smoking clearing. \"If that was a level one slime... I really, really need to find some armor that isn't made of 'Prop' material. Or maybe a shield. A very, very big shield.\"\n\nHe looked at the sword. In his hands, it no longer felt like a toy. It felt like a detonator.\n\n\"One hit,\" he muttered, his eyes reflecting the dying glow of the crater. \"One hit is all it takes. Now I just have to figure out how to not miss the next five times.\"\n\nThe sun continued to shine, the birds (the ones that hadn't been vaporized) began to chirp again, and Arthur Penhaligon, the Level 2 Glass Cannon, began to plan his next move in a world that was clearly not prepared for his arrival.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"location\": \"Tutorial Zone\",\n    \"cast_present_ids\": [\"CHAR_ARTIE\"],\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie defeated a Level 1 Lesser Forest Slime with a single 'Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit'.\",\n      \"The impact of the crit vaporized the slime and a massive oak tree, creating a large crater.\",\n      \"Artie reached Level 2 and gained 5 stat points.\",\n      \"The System issued a warning about environmental destruction.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\", \"THREAD_SYSTEM_GLITCH\"]\n  },\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie missed the slime five times before landing a 'Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit' that vaporized the enemy and the surrounding environment.\",\n      \"The destruction of the oak tree and the slime resulted in Artie leveling up to Level 2.\",\n      \"Artie realized the terrifying scale of his damage output and the fragility of his 1 HP build.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Artie missed five consecutive attacks against a Level 1 slime.\",\n      \"Artie landed a 'Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit' dealing 9,999,999 damage.\",\n      \"The oak tree Artie was backed against was completely destroyed by the crit's shockwave.\",\n      \"Artie defeated his first enemy and reached Level 2.\",\n      \"Artie received 5 unallocated stat points.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"milestone: artie_death = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: system_entry = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: chips_retrieved = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: stat_allocation = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: tutorial_arrival = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: first_kill = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: level_2_reached = DONE\",\n      \"location: Tutorial Zone\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Rusty Shortsword (Prop) (carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Smartphone (dead) (stowed, container=pockets)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Wallet (stowed, container=pockets)\",\n      \"status: CHAR_ARTIE -> 1/1 HP\",\n      \"status: CHAR_ARTIE -> 100% Critical Hit Rate\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Artie successfully defeated his first monster, a Level 1 slime, using a game-breaking critical hit.\",\n      \"The resulting explosion destroyed a significant portion of the tutorial environment.\",\n      \"Artie is now Level 2 but remains at 1 HP.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 4,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\"item\": \"Rusty Shortsword (Prop)\", \"status\": \"carried\", \"container\": \"hand_right\"},\n        {\"item\": \"Smartphone (dead)\", \"status\": \"stowed\", \"container\": \"pockets\"},\n        {\"item\": \"Wallet\", \"status\": \"stowed\", \"container\": \"pockets\"}\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\"container\": \"hand_right\", \"location\": \"arm_right\", \"contents\": [\"Rusty Shortsword (Prop)\"]},\n        {\"container\": \"pockets\", \"location\": \"legs\", \"contents\": [\"Smartphone (dead)\", \"Wallet\"]}\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie is now terrified of his own power and the potential for environmental collateral damage.\",\n        \"Artie views his 'Prop' sword as a high-yield explosive rather than a blade.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the RNG-Hellscape\",\"goal\":\"Introduce Artie and his

It looked like a giant, sentient glob of lime-flavored Jell-O that had been dropped on a dusty floor and decided to take its resentment out on the world. But as it rippled, its translucent green body quivering with a rhythmic, wet *thwack-thwack-thwack* against the grass, Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon knew better. \n\nIn this world, that lime-flavored Jell-O was a tactical nuke.\n\nArtie\u2019s back hit the rough, uncaring bark of a massive oak tree. The tree had probably stood for a hundred years, witnessing the rise and fall of empires, or at least the spawning of many, many low-level mobs. Now, it was just a backstop for Artie\u2019s impending demise. \n\n[Lesser Forest Slime - Lvl 1]\n[HP: 10/10]\n[Attack: 2]\n\nTwo damage. That was it. If the slime so much as sneezed on him, Artie\u2019s 1 HP would vanish, and he\u2019d be nothing more than a footnote in the System\u2019s error logs. \n\n\"Okay, Artie. Think. You\u2019re an analyst. You analyze things. That\u2019s what it says on the LinkedIn profile you\u2019ll never see again,\" he muttered, his voice cracking. He adjusted his grip on the Rusty Shortsword (Prop). The 'Prop' part of the name really didn't inspire confidence. It felt less like a weapon and more like a piece of stage scenery that had been left out in the rain since the late nineties. \n\nThe slime lunged.\n\nIt didn't move fast, but it moved with a terrifying, singular purpose. It launched itself like a wet beanbag, a wobbling mass of green malice aimed directly at Artie\u2019s midsection.\n\n\"Not today, dessert!\" Artie yelled, swinging the rusted hunk of metal with all the grace of a man trying to swat a fly with a lead pipe.\n\nThe sword whistled through the air. It was a clear, direct path. It should have sliced the slime in half. Instead, the blade seemed to hit an invisible wall an inch away from the green surface. \n\n[Miss!]\n\n\"What? I was right there!\" Artie screamed. The slime landed in the dirt, leaving a sticky trail of goo just inches from his boots. \"That was a hit! I saw it! The hitbox is rigged!\"\n\nThe slime didn't care about Artie\u2019s grievances regarding collision detection. It turned, its entire body compressing like a spring. \n\nArtie didn't wait. He stepped forward, trying to catch the monster while it was recovering. He brought the sword down in a vertical chop, a move he\u2019d seen in a dozen fantasy movies. This time, he was sure. He was focused. He was...\n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe sword buried itself three inches deep into a protruding oak root. The impact jarred Artie\u2019s teeth, sending a vibration up his arm that felt like it was trying to disassemble his elbow. \n\n\"Two!\" Artie gasped, pulling the sword free with a desperate yank. \"That\u2019s two misses on a target the size of a beach ball! I have a 100% Crit rate! How can I crit if I can't even touch the damn thing?\"\n\nThe slime launched again. This time, it aimed higher, going for Artie\u2019s face. He ducked, the green mass flying over his head and slapping against the oak tree behind him with a sound like a wet steak hitting a windowpane. It clung to the bark for a second before sliding down, leaving a steaming trail of corrosive slime.\n\nArtie spun around, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird. He swung a wild, horizontal lash. \n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe blade passed through the space the slime had occupied a millisecond prior. The creature had flattened itself into a pancake, the metal whistling harmlessly over its gelatinous \"head.\"\n\n\"Three,\" Artie whimpered. \"The System is mocking me. It has to be. It\u2019s giving me the power of a god and the accuracy of a stormtrooper with a hangover.\"\n\nHe was sweating now. The Tutorial Zone, which had seemed like a peaceful forest only minutes ago, now felt like a claustrophobic arena. The sunlight filtering through the leaves looked like prison bars. He could hear the wind whistling through the branches, sounding suspiciously like the System Administrator laughing at him.\n\nThe slime reformed, wobbling with what Artie could only describe as smugness. It didn't have eyes, but he felt judged. \n\n\"Alright, you overgrown gummy bear. Let's try this again.\"\n\nHe lunged forward, a desperate thrust. He put his shoulder into it, aiming for the very center of the green mass. \n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe sword slid off the slime\u2019s curved surface as if the creature were coated in industrial-grade Teflon. The momentum carried Artie forward, and he nearly face-planted into the corrosive trail on the tree. He managed to catch himself, his fingers brushing against the bark just inches from a patch of bubbling sap.\n\n\"Four!\" Artie roared, his voice echoing through the trees. \"I am a statistical anomaly! I am the master of the critical hit! I am... currently being outplayed by a puddle!\"\n\nThe slime was preparing its biggest lunge yet. It began to vibrate, its green hue deepening as it gathered its strength. The ground beneath it seemed to tremble\u2014or maybe that was just Artie\u2019s legs. \n\nHe had one chance. He took a deep breath, trying to remember everything he\u2019d ever read about combat. *Center your weight. Watch the tell. Don't blink.*\n\nThe slime exploded off the ground. \n\nArtie swung. It was a perfect arc. It was the swing of a hero. It was the swing of a man who was tired of being a level-zero loser in a world governed by math.\n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe sword hit a low-hanging branch, snapping it clean off. The branch fell, hitting Artie on the shoulder. It didn't do damage\u2014the System apparently didn't count 'embarrassment' as a status effect\u2014but it was the final insult.\n\n\"Five,\" Artie whispered, his eyes wide as the slime hovered in mid-air, inches from his chest. \"I missed five times. I\u2019m dead. I\u2019m actually going to die to a level one slime.\"\n\nTime seemed to slow down. He could see the individual bubbles of gas trapped inside the slime\u2019s body. He could see the way the light refracted through its translucent skin. He could see his own reflection in the green goo, looking small and terrified.\n\nAnd then, something clicked. \n\nIt wasn't a physical movement. It was a feeling in the back of his mind, a sudden alignment of variables. The 100% Critical Hit Rate wasn't just a stat; it was a promise. And the System was finally ready to deliver.\n\nArtie didn't think. He didn't aim. He just let the sword move. \n\nHis right hand, still gripping the Rusty Shortsword (Prop), jerked upward in a short, sharp flick. It wasn't even a full swing. It was a twitch. A glitch in the animation.\n\nThe tip of the rusted blade touched the very edge of the slime.\n\nThe world turned white.\n\n[SUPER-MEGA-ULTRA-CRIT!]\n\nThe sound wasn't a *thwack* or a *slice*. It was the sound of a mountain being shattered by a tuning fork. A pillar of pure, blinding golden light erupted from the point of contact. \n\nThe Level 1 Lesser Forest Slime didn't just die. It ceased to exist. Its molecular structure was dismantled so fast that it didn't even have time to register a death animation. It vaporized into a cloud of green steam that was immediately incinerated by the sheer heat of the crit.\n\nBut the crit wasn't done. \n\nThe energy wave hit the oak tree behind Artie. The hundred-year-old giant, with its massive trunk and sprawling roots, vanished. There was no falling timber, no cracking of wood. There was only a roar of displaced air as the tree was reduced to toothpicks and then to ash in a fraction of a second.\n\nThe shockwave knocked Artie backward, but the System\u2019s weird physics kept him upright. He watched, mouth agape, as the golden light carved a perfect, circular crater into the earth where the tree had stood. The ground was scorched black, the edges of the pit glowing with residual heat.\n\nSilence returned to the Tutorial Zone, broken only by the sound of a few stray leaves fluttering down into the smoking hole.\n\nThen, the notifications started.\n\n[System Notification]\n[Target: Lesser Forest Slime (Lvl 1) - DEFEATED]\n[Damage Dealt: 9,999,999 (Overkill)]\n[Experience Gained: 50 XP]\n\n[Level Up!]\n[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon: Level 1 -> Level 2]\n[Stat Points Gained: 5]\n[Note: Please try to leave some of the environment for the other players. The janitorial sub-routines are complaining.]\n\nArtie stood there, his arm still raised, the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) trembling in his hand. The 'Prop' was now glowing with a faint, dying ember of gold. \n\n\"I...\" Artie started, his voice a dry rasp. He looked at the smoking crater. He looked at the empty space where a massive tree had been seconds ago. He looked at his own hands. \"I think I might be a little bit broken.\"\n\nHe checked his status bar. \n\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Level: 2]\n\nHe was still one stiff breeze away from a Game Over, but he had just deleted a piece of the world's geometry because he\u2019d gotten lucky. No, not lucky. He\u2019d gotten *math*. \n\n\"Level two,\" he breathed, a hysterical laugh bubbling up in his throat. \"I\u2019m level two. And all it took was the total destruction of a local ecosystem.\"\n\nHe sat down on the edge of the crater, his legs finally giving out. The dirt was still warm. He reached into his pocket, feeling the familiar weight of his dead smartphone and his wallet. They felt like relics from a different reality, a place where slimes didn't exist and trees stayed where you put them.\n\n\"Okay,\" Artie said to the empty forest. \"If that was a level one slime... I really, really need to find some armor that isn't made of 'Prop' material.\"\n\nHe looked at the sword. It was still rusted. It was still a prop. But in his hands, it felt like a detonator. \n\n\"One hit,\" he muttered. \"One hit is all it takes. Now I just have to figure out how to not miss the next five times.\"\n\nThe sun continued to shine, the birds (the ones that hadn't been vaporized) began to chirp again, and Artie Penhaligon, the Level 2 Glass Cannon, began to plan his next move in a world that was clearly not prepared for his arrival.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n
