You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\n",

It looked like the inside of a broken monitor\u2014a flickering, neon-blue purgatory that smelled faintly of ozone and regret. Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon drifted in the center of it, still clutching the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) in his right hand. The plastic hilt felt absurdly real for something that had just helped conduct enough electricity to fry his nervous system into a blackened crisp.\n\n\"Welcome, User 4,029,381,\" a voice echoed, sounding like a text-to-speech program with a severe attitude problem. \"Cause of Death: Terminal Embarrassment by Snack-O-Matic 3000. Congratulations. You are the first person this century to be killed by a bag of 'Nacho Average Jalape\u00f1o' chips.\"\n\n\"It was a faulty wire,\" Artie snapped, his voice echoing in the emptiness. He tried to cross his arms, but floating in zero-G made the gesture look more like a clumsy interpretive dance. \"And for the record, the chips fell. I won that encounter.\"\n\n\"You died for a snack that is forty percent sawdust by volume,\" the voice replied. Suddenly, a spark of golden light erupted a few feet from his nose. It swirled, compressed, and popped into the shape of a small, translucent woman with shimmering wings and a clipboard that looked suspiciously like an iPad.\n\n\"Who are you? The ghost of customer service?\" Artie asked.\n\nThe creature sighed, a sound like static on a radio. \"I\u2019m Fizz. I\u2019m your legally mandated System Guide. My job is to make sure you don't immediately walk into a spike pit the second you spawn. Though, looking at your current equipment...\" She gestured with a tiny, glowing hand at the LARP sword. \"A 'Rusty Shortsword (Prop)'? Really? You're bringing a toy to a death-match?\"\n\n\"It has sentimental value,\" Artie lied. \"And a conductive core, apparently. Where am I? Is this the part where I get reincarnated as a slime or a vending machine?\"\n\n\"Don't give the System ideas,\" Fizz muttered, tapping her clipboard. A massive, translucent blue screen shimmered into existence between them. \"This is Character Creation. Usually, we do the whole 'sculpting your cheekbones' thing, but since you died with a 'Stupidity-Induced Electrical Discharge,' the System has flagged you for an accelerated start. You\u2019ve got 100 Stat Points. Spend them, or I\u2019m spending them for you on 'Agility' so I don't have to watch you move this slowly for the next three levels.\"\n\nArtie squinted at the screen. The text flickered, lines of code occasionally bleeding into the margins.\n\n[Character Name: Arthur Penhaligon]\n[Class: Unassigned]\n[Level: 1]\n[HP: 10/10]\n[MP: 10/10]\n\n[Attributes]\n[Strength: 5]\n[Vitality: 5]\n[Agility: 5]\n[Intelligence: 5]\n[Luck: 5]\n\n[Available Points: 100]\n\n\"Okay,\" Artie said, his cynical instincts kicking into high gear. He\u2019d played enough RPGs to know that 'Glass Cannon' builds were for people who enjoyed seeing a 'Game Over' screen every five minutes. \"If I\u2019m going into a world where slimes can actually kill me, I want to be a tank. Put eighty points into Vitality and twenty into Strength. I want to be a walking brick wall.\"\n\n\"Boring,\" Fizz said, yawning. \"But fine. It\u2019s your funeral. Again.\"\n\nArtie reached out, his finger hovering over the plus sign next to 'Vitality.' He pressed it.\n\nThe screen didn't respond. He pressed it again. A spark jumped from the 'Vitality' bar to his fingertip\u2014a sharp, stinging reminder of the Snack-O-Matic. \n\n\"Uh, Fizz? The screen is doing that thing again.\"\n\n\"What thing?\" Fizz looked up from her clipboard. \"Oh, the glitching? Yeah, the System\u2019s been a bit twitchy since the last patch. Just give it a firm\u2014\"\n\nBefore she could finish, the screen went wild. The lines of text began to scroll at terminal velocity. The 'Vitality' bar started to drain, the numbers dropping into the negatives before looping back around. A phantom image of a 'Nacho Average Jalape\\u00f1o' bag flashed across the UI, accompanied by a loud, crunchy sound effect.\n\n\"What is happening?!\" Artie yelled, trying to grab the edges of the screen.\n\n\"The electrical surge!\" Fizz shouted, her wings flapping frantically. \"Your soul is still carrying a residual charge from the vending machine! It\u2019s overloading the input buffer!\"\n\nArtie watched in horror as the 'Available Points' counter plummeted to zero in a fraction of a second. The numbers weren't going into Vitality. They were pouring into a sub-stat he hadn't even noticed at the bottom of the list.\n\n[Critical Probability: 100%]\n[Critical Multiplier: 500%]\n\n\"Wait, stop!\" Artie lunged for the 'Reset' button, but his hand passed right through the flickering light. \n\nThe System voice boomed, sounding remarkably smug. \"Stat Allocation Finalized. Recalculating survivability parameters... Error. Logic Loop Detected. Balancing 'Absolute Offense' with 'Absolute Fragility.'\"\n\n[System Notification]\n[Warning: Statistical Anomaly Detected.]\n[Attribute 'Vitality' has been reduced to minimum threshold to compensate for 'Critical Probability' overflow.]\n[Trait Acquired: Glass Cannon (Legendary/Cursed)]\n[Description: You hit like a god, but you have the structural integrity of a wet paper towel.]\n\nArtie\u2019s jaw dropped as he watched his HP bar shrink. It didn't just go down; it withered. It became a tiny, pathetic sliver of red that looked like it would vanish if he sneezed too hard.\n\n[HP: 1/1]\n\n\"One?\" Artie whispered, his voice cracking. \"I have one hit point? Fizz, I have one hit point! That\u2019s not a health bar, that\u2019s a binary state! I\u2019m either alive or a puddle!\"\n\nFizz flew closer, squinting at the screen. She whistled low. \"On the bright side, you have a one hundred percent critical hit rate. That\u2019s... actually impossible. The cap is usually forty percent for Level 1s. You\u2019ve basically broken the math of the universe before even stepping foot in it.\"\n\n\"I don't care about the math!\" Artie waved the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) around. \"A stiff breeze will kill me! A moderately aggressive squirrel could end my entire second life!\"\n\n\"Well, look at it this way,\" Fizz said, tucking her clipboard away as the void began to dissolve into white pixels at the edges. \"You won't have to worry about long-term medical bills. It\u2019s a 'Crit or Quit' build, Arthur. Very trendy. Very high-stakes.\"\n\n\"I hate high-stakes! I wanted to be a brick wall!\"\n\n\"Too late,\" Fizz said, her form beginning to fade. \"The transport sequence is already locked in. Pro tip: Don't get hit. At all. Ever.
