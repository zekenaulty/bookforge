PROSE:

The coil turned with the agonizing Slowness of a dial-up connection in a hurricane. Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon leaned his forehead against the cool, scratched glass of the Break-O-Matic 3000, his breath fogging the view of his only reason for living: a crinkled blue bag of Salt & Vinegar chips at coordinate C-4. 

[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon - Lvl 1 Office Drone]
[HP: 10/10]

"Come on, you mechanical extortionist," Artie muttered. He shifted his weight, feeling the restrictive pull of his Silk Tie. It was a cheap polyester blend that promised "executive sheen" but delivered "slow strangulation." 

In his right hand, he clutched his Leather Wallet, the imitation cowhide sweaty against his palm. His left hand was a closed fist around a few remaining pieces of Loose Change—the metallic shrapnel of a failed morning. He’d already fed the machine four quarters, two dimes, and a nickel that looked like it had been chewed by a disgruntled badger. 

The coil stopped. 

The bag of chips dangled, hooked by a single plastic corner, suspended over the drop chute like a climber clinging to a cliff face in a bad action movie. It didn't fall. It didn't move. It just mocked him.

"You’ve got to be kidding me," Artie said, his Sarcasm skill—currently his only level 10 attribute—itching for a workout. "I’ve spent three hours today entering quarterly data for a manager who thinks 'The Cloud' is where God keeps his emails. I have earned these chips. I have bled for these chips. Metaphorically. Mostly from papercuts."

He tapped the glass. Nothing. He gave the machine a firm nudge with his shoulder. The Break-O-Matic 3000 responded with a low, ominous hum that sounded less like a cooling fan and more like a dragon with a sinus infection.

[Skill Check: Sarcasm - Success!]
"Oh, great. Now you’re growling at me. What’s next? A paywall for the napkins?"

Artie looked down at the Loose Change in his left hand. One more quarter. If he could just jar the machine enough to break the stalemate at C-4, he might survive the afternoon without biting a coworker. He reached out to stabilize himself against the metal frame of the machine, his Leather Wallet still gripped tightly in his right hand.

The hum changed frequency. It went from a low rumble to a high-pitched whine that made the fillings in Artie’s teeth vibrate. 

Inside the machine, the fluorescent light flickered, then died. A smell of ozone and scorched caramel filled the breakroom. Artie should have pulled away. A sensible man, a man with more than 4 points in Data Entry and a survival instinct that wasn't currently clouded by vinegar-scented desire, would have stepped back.

Instead, Artie kicked the base of the machine.

"Give. Me. My. Chips."

The machine didn't give him chips. It gave him three hundred volts of unadulterated, poorly-grounded fury.

A spark the size of a golf ball leaped from the coin slot to Artie’s knuckles. The world didn't go black immediately; it went neon violet. He felt the surge travel up his arm, dancing through the Silk Tie like a lightning rod, and exiting through his heels. 

[Critical Hit! -12 HP]

[Warning: Health has reached 0. Initiating Emergency Egress.]

Artie didn't even have time to scream. His vision pixelated. The drab beige walls of the office breakroom began to tear at the seams, revealing a vast, shimmering grid of white light beneath the reality he’d known. The sensation was less like dying and more like being deleted by a frustrated IT intern.

"I... still... paid..." he managed to choke out, though he wasn't sure if he was speaking or just thinking in binary.

The floor vanished. The vending machine vanished. The lingering scent of Salt & Vinegar was replaced by the sterile, scentless vacuum of the infinite. 

Artie tumbled into the white. He was no longer standing; he was floating, suspended in a pressurized void that hummed with the collective energy of a billion server racks. His Leather Wallet and Loose Change were gone, dissolved into data packets. Even his Silk Tie had stripped away, leaving him in a default, grey-mesh jumpsuit that felt suspiciously like pajamas.

[System Notification: Welcome, User 402-99-ARTIE.]
[Status: Deceased (Local Reality)]
[Status: Pending (System Integration)]

"Where am I?" Artie asked. His voice didn't echo. It just sat there, flat and digital.

[You are in the Character Creation Void. Please wait while your life's 'Achievements' are calculated.]

Artie squinted. In front of him, a giant, floating semi-transparent screen flickered into existence. It was covered in progress bars, most of which were depressingly empty.

[Calculating 'Career Success'... 0.02%]
[Calculating 'Social Impact'... 0.01%]
[Calculating 'Total Luck'... Error: Value too low to display.]

"Hey!" Artie shouted at the void. "I was a Senior Data Entry Associate! I had a 401k! Sort of!"

[Calculation Complete.]
[Base Stats assigned based on previous life performance.]
[Warning: Statistical Anomaly detected in 'Fortitude' and 'Luck' sectors.]

Artie watched as the screen shifted, revealing a series of sliders and numbers that made his head spin. He didn't know what was happening, but he knew one thing for certain: the vending machine had definitely won that round.
