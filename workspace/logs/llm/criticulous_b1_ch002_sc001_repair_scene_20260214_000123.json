  "text": "COMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: SC_002_001\nAllowed events: Artie attempts to sell the Participation Trophy, merchant panics as Aggro Meter spikes, failed transfer due to soul-bound status, Artie gains permanent 'The Eternal Participant' status, shop is besieged by monsters.\nForbidden milestones: Any events from Chapter 2 Scene 2 or later (dungeon entry, gear acquisition).\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: Artie holding Participation Trophy in hand_left; ID Badge equipped on neck; Smartphone stowed in pocket_right.\n\nAPPEARANCE_CHECK:\n- CHAR_ARTIE: late-20s, slight build, hazel eyes, mousy brown unruly hair, rumpled dress shirt, vending machine scar.\n- CHAR_FIZZ: diminutive ethereal system wisp, neon blue hair, translucent blue skin, pixelated trail.\n\nPROSE:\nThe bell above the door chimed with a cheery, synthesized ring that felt entirely too optimistic for a man with a single hit point and a literal beacon for murder clutched in his hand. Artie stepped into \"Barnaby\u2019s Bargains & Blunders,\" his boots scuffing against floorboards that looked like they\u2019d been rendered with a low-resolution texture pack. \n\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Aggro Meter: 94% (Status: Cooling...)]\n\n\"Cooling, my ass,\" Artie muttered, shifting his grip on the Participation Trophy. The gold-plated plastic felt warm\u2014unpleasantly so\u2014and it emitted a low-frequency hum that made his teeth ache. It wasn't just an item; it was a rhythmic headache that told every monster in a three-mile radius exactly where to find a squishy, Level 2 snack.\n\nFizz hovered near his shoulder, her neon blue form flickering. Her pixelated trail left a faint shimmer in the dusty air of the shop. \"Look, Artie, the math is simple. Merchants in Oakhaven are programmed to accept almost any loot as long as it has a rarity tag. You dump the trophy, the 'Monster Beacon' status falls off, and we can go back to being regular, non-murdered anomalies.\"\n\n\"Regular is a stretch,\" Artie said, eyeing the merchant behind the counter. \n\nThe man, presumably Barnaby, was a stout NPC with a mustache so symmetrical it had to be a procedural asset. He was currently polishing a rusted buckler, but as Artie approached, the merchant\u2019s eyes drifted toward the Participation Trophy. Then they drifted toward Artie\u2019s face. Then they widened.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 95% (Warning: Social Tension Rising)]\n\n\"Welcome to\u2014\" Barnaby started, then stopped. He sniffed the air. \"By the Great D20, boy, what are you carrying? You smell like a world boss and a bad debt.\"\n\nArtie didn't waste time with pleasantries. He\u2019d spent ten years in data entry; he knew how to cut through the fluff. He slammed the Participation Trophy onto the wooden counter. The hum of the item grew louder, a vibrating *thrum-thrum-thrum* that caused a display of glass potions to rattle precariously.\n\n\"I want to sell this,\" Artie said. \"Give me five copper. Give me a stale cracker. Just take it out of my inventory.\"\n\nBarnaby leaned over the counter, squinting. A translucent window popped up between them, visible only to Artie.\n\n[Trade Interface: Initiated]\n[Item: Participation Trophy (Cursed)]\n[Value: 0 Gold, 0 Silver, 1 'Get Out of My Shop' Look]\n\n\"I can't take that,\" Barnaby whispered, his voice trembling. He reached out a hand, then yanked it back as if the trophy were made of white-hot maggot-fire. \"That\u2019s not just loot. That\u2019s... that\u2019s a liability. Look at the meter, lad!\"\n\nArtie glanced up. The red bar above his head was pulsing.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 97% (Alert: Local Entities Becoming Hostile)]\n\nOutside the shop window, Artie saw a stray dog stop in the street. It bared its teeth, its eyes turning a glowing, aggressive red. A passing guard paused, his hand drifting toward the hilt of his sword, his gaze fixed on the shop\u2019s front door with sudden, inexplicable loathing.\n\n\"It\u2019s just a trophy!\" Artie hissed. \"It says I participated! That\u2019s a good thing! Positive reinforcement!\"\n\n\"It\u2019s a beacon!\" Fizz chirped, though she looked worried. \"Artie, try the 'Force Sell' exploit. Use your Data Entry skill to bypass the confirmation prompt. If you can move the item data to his side of the ledger before the System realizes it\u2019s soul-bound\u2014\"\n\n\"Soul-bound?\" Artie\u2019s heart hammered against his ribs\u2014a dangerous activity for a man with 1 HP. \"You didn't mention soul-bound.\"\n\n\"I was eighty percent sure it wasn't!\" Fizz countered, her pixels buzzing. \"The other twenty percent was... well, the 'Cursed' tag is a bit of a wildcard.\"\n\nArtie ignored the mounting panic and focused on the counter. He reached out, grabbing the Participation Trophy with his left hand, his thumb brushing the vending machine scar on his right knuckle as he tried to shove the item toward Barnaby\u2019s chest. \n\n\"Take. The. Deal,\" Artie commanded.\n\n[Skill Check: Data Entry (Rank F) vs. Merchant Willpower]\n[Result: Critical Success! (100% Crit Rate Applied)]\n\nThe world stuttered. For a fraction of a second, the Participation Trophy turned into a string of raw hexadecimal code. Artie felt the weight of the Participation Trophy leave his hand. The 'Trade Confirmed' chime rang out, a beautiful, melodic sound that promised freedom from the hum.\n\nThen, the System screamed.\n\n[ERROR: Invalid Transaction]\n[Item 'Participation Trophy' is Soul-Bound to: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]\n[Reason: You didn't just participate; you're the only one left.]\n\nThe Participation Trophy didn't just reappear in Artie's hand; it manifested with a thunderclap of static. The force of the failed transfer sent a shockwave through the shop. Barnaby was blown backward, hitting a shelf of 'Minor Health Potions' that shattered, drenching him in red liquid that looked suspiciously like strawberry syrup.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 98% (MAXIMUM PROXIMITY ALERT)]\n\n\"Out!\" Barnaby screamed, scrambling to his feet, his mustache twitching in terror. \"Get that thing out of here! You\u2019re bringing the whole zone down on us! I can hear the slimes hitting the walls!\"\n\nArtie looked at the door. The scratching sound of claws against wood was unmistakable. Through the glass, he saw the shadows of at least three Level 5 'Rabid Town Dogs' and one very confused, very angry guard.\n\n\"I can't drop it!\" Artie yelled, shaking his left hand. The Participation Trophy was stuck to his palm like it had been welded there by a god with a sick sense of humor. \"It\u2019s part of me now!\"\n\n\"It\u2019s a permanent status effect,\" Fizz said, her voice small. \"The 'Monster Beacon' isn't coming off, Artie. You aren't just a player anymore. You\u2019re the objective.\"\n\n[System Notification: New Status Permanent - 'The Eternal Participant']\n[Description: You cannot discard the Participation Trophy. You cannot sell it. You are the lighthouse in the storm of RNG. Monsters will always find you. Good luck (You'll need it).]\n\nArtie looked at the trophy, then at his 1/1 HP bar, then at the door as it began to splinter under the weight of the aggro-crazed mobs outside.\n\n\"Great,\" Artie whispered, his hazel eyes reflecting the flickering blue light of his guide. \"I\u2019m not a hero. I\u2019m a loot drop that walks like a man.\"\n\nHe gripped the trophy tight, the hum now vibrating through his entire arm. He had 1 HP, a 100% crit rate, and a world that suddenly, collectively, wanted him dead.\n\n\"Fizz?\"\n\n\"Yes, Artie?\"\n\n\"Remind me to crit the next person who offers me a trophy.\"\n\nArtie turned toward the back door, the only exit that wasn't currently being besieged by the local wildlife. He didn't have a plan, but he had a very high movement speed fueled by pure, unadulterated terror.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"CHAR_FIZZ\"],\n    \"location\": \"Oakhaven - Merchant Shop\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie attempted to sell the Participation Trophy to Barnaby, but the transaction failed due to a soul-bound error.\",\n      \"The failed transfer caused a system shockwave, destroying Barnaby's stock and spiking Artie's Aggro Meter to 98%.\",\n      \"Artie gained the permanent status 'The Eternal Participant', making the Participation Trophy impossible to discard.\",\n      \"The merchant shop is currently under siege by aggro-crazed local entities.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\", \"THREAD_SYSTEM_GLITCH\", \"THREAD_VANE_RIVALRY\"]\n  },\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\"item\": \"ITEM_ID_BADGE\", \"container\": \"neck\", \"status\": \"equipped\"},\n        {\"item\": \"ITEM_SMARTPHONE\", \"container\": \"pocket_right\", \"status\": \"stowed\"},\n        {\"item\": \"ITEM_PARTICIPATION_TROPHY\", \"container\": \"hand_left\", \"status\": \"held\"}\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\"container\": \"neck\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_ID_BADGE\"]},\n        {\"container\": \"pocket_right\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_SMARTPHONE\"]},\n        {\"container\": \"hand_left\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_PARTICIPATION_TROPHY\"]}\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\"Artie is now resigned to his role as a walking lighthouse for monsters, his anxiety shifting into a grim, survivalist focus.\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"character_continuity_system_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"set\": {\n        \"resources\": {\n          \"aggro_meter\": 98\n        },\n        \"statuses\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"Monster Beacon\",\n            \"source\": \"ITEM_PARTICIPATION_TROPHY\",\n            \"effect\": \"Massively increases aggro radius;

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nUI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says \"always include\".\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it unless explicitly removing a stale fact with REMOVE and restating the current truth.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v2\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\":

        "content": "# REPAIR\n\nFix the scene based on lint issues.\nSummaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\nTimeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: pre-scene invariants and summary facts are binding unless the Scene Card depicts a change. If this scene changes a durable fact, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value and remove the old entry.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n\n- must_stay_true removal (mandatory when a durable fact is superseded):\n  - Add \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" in summary_update.must_stay_true.\n  - Place REMOVE lines before the new final invariant.\n  - REMOVE lines also apply to key_facts_ring (purge stale facts from continuity).\n\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- Inventory posture reconciliation:\n  - If inventory/containers change (held/stowed/container), must_stay_true must be updated to the final posture.\n  - Add REMOVE lines for prior inventory/container invariants before the new final entries.\n  - Use canonical invariant formats:\n    - inventory: CHAR_X -> <item display_name> (status=held|carried|equipped|stowed, container=hand_left|hand_right|<container>)\n    - container: <container> (owner=CHAR_X, contents=[<item display_name>, ...])\nFor held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\nContinuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.\n- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.\n- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.\n- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI gate: only include bracketed UI blocks when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If false, remove or rephrase UI blocks into narrative prose.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or a short parenthetical annotation (e.g., (locked), (Warning: ...)).\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nCanonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\nIf item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for authoritative labels and custody terms.\nUse item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If a durable appearance change occurs in this scene, record it in character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- APPEARANCE_CHECK is required in COMPLIANCE for each cast_present_id (4-8 tokens from atoms/marks).\n\nNaming repairs:\n- If lint flags an item naming issue, fix it with minimal edits.\n- Do not remove humor; simply anchor the item (add display_name near first mention) and ensure custody-change sentences include the display_name.\n- Do not rename item_id or registry fields; only adjust prose wording.\nsummary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\nSTATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\nmust_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\nIf state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\nEnforce scene-card durable constraints: `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\nRespect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`.\n\n- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):\n  - If timeline_scope != \"present\" OR ontological_scope != \"real\", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).\n  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.\n  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category=\"timeline_override\".\n\nReturn corrected prose plus a corrected state_patch JSON block.\n\nOutput format (required, no code fences, no commentary):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n\nAPPEARANCE_CHECK:\n- CHAR_ID: <4-8 tokens from atoms/marks>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}]\n\n- All *_updates arrays must contain objects; never emit bare strings as array entries.\n- JSON shape guardrails (strict, do not deviate):\n  - character_updates MUST be an array of objects.\n    - INVALID: \"character_updates\": {\"character_id\": \"CHAR_X\"}\n    - VALID: \"character_updates\": [{\"character_id\": \"CHAR_X\"}]\n  - character_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects with character_id.\n    - INVALID: \"character_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {...}}\n    - VALID: \"character_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"character_id\": \"CHAR_X\", \"set\": {...}}]\n  - summary_update fields must be arrays of strings.\n    - INVALID: \"summary_update\": {\"last_scene\": \"text\"}\n    - VALID: \"summary_update\": {\"last_scene\": [\"text\"], \"key_events\": [\"...\"], \"must_stay_true\": [\"...\"], \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\"...\"]}\n\n  - appearance_updates MUST be an object under character_updates.\n    - INVALID: \"appearance_updates\": [{\"set\": {...}}] OR \"appearance_updates\": {\"marks_add\": [...]}\n    - VALID: \"appearance_updates\": {\"set\": {\"marks_add\": [{\"name\": \"Singed Hair\", \"location\": \"head\", \"durability\": \"durable\"}]}, \"reason\": \"...\"}\n\n- character_updates.containers must be an array of objects with at least: container, owner, contents (array).\n- Durable-state mutation blocks are mandatory when applicable:\n- Required fields for durable registry entries (when creating NEW ids or filling missing required fields):\n  - item_registry_updates MUST be an array of objects.

Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_device_id, replacement_of.\n  - custodian must be a non-null string id/scope (character id or \"world\"). Never use null.\n    - INVALID: \"custodian\": null\n    - VALID: \"custodian\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\" or \"world\"\n  - owner_scope must be \"character\" or \"world\" and must match the custodian scope.\n  - plot_device_updates: set must include name, custody_scope, custody_ref, activation_state, linked_threads, constraints, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n\n- Transfer vs registry conflict rule (must follow):\n  - If you create a NEW item in item_registry_updates with final custodian already set (e.g., CHAR_ARTIE), DO NOT emit transfer_updates for that item.\n  - If you emit transfer_updates for a NEW item, the registry entry must start with custodian=\"world\" and then transfer to the character.\n  - expected_before must match the registry entry at the moment of transfer (after any registry update that applies before it).  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects; never an object with an `updates` field.\n\n  - inventory_alignment_updates[*].set MUST be an object (not a list).\n    - INVALID: \"set\": []\n    - VALID:   \"set\": {\"inventory\": [...], \"containers\": [...]}\n- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.\n- If you mutate durable state, do not leave the same mutation only in prose.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n- appearance_updates: when a durable appearance change happens, include appearance_updates on the relevant character_updates entry.\n\n  - appearance_updates MUST be an object, not an array.\n    - INVALID: \"appearance_updates\": [{\"set\": {...}, \"reason\": \"...\"}]\n    - VALID: \"appearance_updates\": {\"set\": {\"marks_add\": [{\"name\": \"Singed Hair\", \"location\": \"head\", \"durability\": \"durable\"}]}, \"reason\": \"...\"}\n\n  - appearance_updates.set may include atoms and marks only (canonical truth).\n    - Do NOT put marks_add at the top level; it belongs under set.\n    - Use set.marks_add / set.marks_remove for marks changes.\n    - Use set.atoms for atom changes.\n  - appearance_updates.reason is required (brief, factual).\n  - Do NOT set summary or art text in appearance_updates (derived after acceptance)\n  - Each entry must include character_id, chapter, scene, inventory (full current list), containers (full current list), invariants_add (array), persona_updates (array).\n  - character_updates.inventory MUST be an array of objects, never string item ids.\n  - Inventory object shape: {\"item\":

\"contents\": [\"ITEM_id\", \"...\"]}.\n  - If you have a single persona update, still wrap it in an array of strings.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger and invariants using standard phrasing, e.g.:\n  - Avoid numeric mechanics in must_stay_true; store them in continuity system updates instead.\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> shard (carried, container=satchel)\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> longsword (carried, container=hand_right)\n  - container: satchel (owner=CHAR_example, contents=[shard, maps])\n  - milestone: shard_bind = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - milestone: maps_acquired =

Merchants in Oakhaven are programmed to accept almost any loot as long as it has a rarity tag. You dump the trophy, the 'Monster Beacon' status falls off, and we can go back to being regular, non-murdered anomalies.\"\n\n\"Regular is a stretch,\" Artie said, eyeing the merchant behind the counter. \n\nThe man, presumably Barnaby, was a stout NPC with a mustache so symmetrical it had to be a procedural asset. He was currently polishing a rusted buckler, but as Artie approached, the merchant\u2019s eyes drifted toward the Participation Trophy. Then they drifted toward Artie\u2019s face. Then they widened.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 95% (Warning: Social Tension Rising)]\n\n\"Welcome to\u2014\" Barnaby started, then stopped. He sniffed the air. \"By the Great D20, boy, what are you carrying? You smell like a world boss and a bad debt.\"\n\nArtie didn't waste time with pleasantries. He\u2019d spent ten years in data entry; he knew how to cut through the fluff. He slammed the Participation Trophy onto the wooden counter. The hum of the item grew louder, a vibrating *thrum-thrum-thrum* that caused a display of glass potions to rattle precariously.\n\n\"I want to sell this,\" Artie said. \"Give me five copper. Give me a stale cracker. Just take it out of my inventory.\"\n\nBarnaby leaned over the counter, squinting. A translucent window popped up between them, visible only to Artie.\n\n[Trade Interface: Initiated]\n[Item: Participation Trophy (Cursed)]\n[Value: 0 Gold, 0 Silver, 1 'Get Out of My Shop' Look]\n\n\"I can't take that,\" Barnaby whispered, his voice trembling. He reached out a hand, then yanked it back as if the trophy were made of white-hot maggot-fire. \"That\u2019s not just loot. That\u2019s... that\u2019s a liability. Look at the meter, lad!\"\n\nArtie glanced up. The red bar above his head was pulsing.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 97% (Alert: Local Entities Becoming Hostile)]\n\nOutside the shop window, Artie saw a stray dog stop in the street. It bared its teeth, its eyes turning a glowing, aggressive red. A passing guard paused, his hand drifting toward the hilt of his sword, his gaze fixed on the shop\u2019s front door with sudden, inexplicable loathing.\n\n\"It\u2019s just a trophy!\" Artie hissed. \"It says I participated! That\u2019s a good thing! Positive reinforcement!\"\n\n\"It\u2019s a beacon!\" Fizz chirped, though she looked worried. \"Artie, try the 'Force Sell' exploit. Use your Data Entry skill to bypass the confirmation prompt. If you can move the item data to his side of the ledger before the System realizes it\u2019s soul-bound\u2014\"\n\n\"Soul-bound?\" Artie\u2019s heart hammered against his ribs\u2014a dangerous activity for a man with 1 HP. \"You didn't mention soul-bound.\"\n\n\"I was eighty percent sure it wasn't!\" Fizz countered, her pixels buzzing. \"The other twenty percent was... well, the 'Cursed' tag is a bit of a wildcard.\"\n\nArtie ignored the mounting panic and focused on the counter. He reached out, grabbing the Participation Trophy with his left hand, his thumb brushing the vending machine scar on his right knuckle as he tried to shove the item toward Barnaby\u2019s chest. \n\n\"Take. The. Deal,\" Artie commanded.\n\n[Skill Check: Data Entry (Rank F) vs. Merchant Willpower]\n[Result: Critical Success! (100% Crit Rate Applied)]\n\nThe world stuttered. For a fraction of a second, the Participation Trophy turned into a string of raw hexadecimal code. Artie felt the weight of the item leave his hand. The 'Trade Confirmed' chime rang out, a beautiful, melodic sound that promised freedom from the hum.\n\nThen, the System screamed.\n\n[ERROR: Invalid Transaction]\n[Item 'Participation Trophy' is Soul-Bound to: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]\n[Reason: You didn't just participate; you're the only one left.]\n\nThe trophy didn't just reappear in Artie's hand; it manifested with a thunderclap of static. The force of the failed transfer sent a shockwave through the shop. Barnaby was blown backward, hitting a shelf of 'Minor Health Potions' that shattered, drenching him in red liquid that looked suspiciously like strawberry syrup.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 98% (MAXIMUM PROXIMITY ALERT)]\n\n\"Out!\" Barnaby screamed, scrambling to his feet, his mustache twitching in terror. \"Get that thing out of here! You\u2019re bringing the whole zone down on us! I can hear the slimes hitting the walls!\"\n\nArtie looked at the door. The scratching sound of claws against wood was unmistakable. Through the glass, he saw the shadows of at least three Level 5 'Rabid Town Dogs' and one very confused, very angry guard.\n\n\"I can't drop it!\" Artie yelled, shaking his left hand. The Participation Trophy was stuck to his palm like it had been welded there by a god with a sick sense of humor. \"It\u2019s part of me now!\"\n\n\"It\u2019s a permanent status effect,\" Fizz said, her voice small. \"The 'Monster Beacon' isn't coming off, Artie. You aren't just a player anymore. You\u2019re the objective.\"\n\n[System Notification: New Status Permanent - 'The Eternal Participant']\n[Description: You cannot discard the Participation Trophy. You cannot sell it. You are the lighthouse in the storm of RNG. Monsters will always find you. Good luck (You'll need it).]\n\nArtie looked at the trophy, then at his 1/1 HP bar, then at the door as it began to splinter under the weight of the aggro-crazed mobs outside.\n\n\"Great,\" Artie whispered, his hazel eyes reflecting the flickering blue light of his guide. \"I\u2019m not a hero. I\u2019m a loot drop that walks like a man.\"\n\nHe gripped the trophy tight, the hum now vibrating through his entire arm. He had 1 HP, a 100% crit rate, and a world that suddenly, collectively, wanted him dead.\n\n\"Fizz?\"\n\n\"Yes, Artie?\"\n\n\"Remind me to crit the next person who offers me a trophy.\"\n\nArtie turned toward the back door, the only exit that wasn't currently being besieged by the local wildlife. He didn't have a plan, but he had a very high movement speed fueled by pure, unadulterated terror.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"characters\": {\n    \"count\": 5,\n    \"status\": \"READY\",\n    \"updated_at\": \"2026-02-13T07:51:22Z\"\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 2,\n    \"scene\": 1\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"global_continuity_system_state\": {\n    \"active_mechanics\": [\n      \"HP\",\n      \"Crit Rate\",\n      \"Point Buy\",\n      \"System Notification\",\n      \"Damage Number\",\n      \"Level Up\",\n      \"Aggro Meter\"\n    ],\n    \"reality_stability\": 44,\n    \"world_type\": \"settlement_interior\"\n  },\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_002/scene_001.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"DRAFTING\",\n  \"summary\": {\n    \"chapter_so_far\": [],\n    \"key_facts_ring\": [\n      \"milestone: run_for_your_life_completed = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: oakhaven_entered = DONE\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Corporate ID Badge (status=equipped, container=neck)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Cracked Smartphone (status=stowed, container=pocket_right)\",\n      \"Artie possesses the 'Gate-Crasher' title (Inactive).\",\n      \"Artie is under the 'Marked for Death' and 'Monster Beacon' statuses (Active).\",\n      \"Artie entered the Mayor's office and was scanned, confirming his Paradoxical Anomaly status.\",\n      \"The Mayor explained the economic value of Crits in Oakhaven's society.\",\n      \"The Mayor offered the 'Cloak of the Bureaucrat' as a way to mask Artie's Anomaly signature.\",\n      \"Artie's Aggro Meter rose to 92% as the Participation Trophy continued to hum.\",\n      \"Artie reluctantly agreed to hear the terms of the Mayor's deal to ensure his survival.\",\n      \"milestone: mayor_met = DONE\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_MAYOR -> Seal of Oakhaven (status=equipped, container=neck)\",\n      \"Artie exited the Mayor's office and was immediately confronted by Vane in the Town Square.\",\n      \"Vane's stats were revealed: Level 45 with the 'Top 100 Slayer' title.\",\n      \"Artie successfully dodged Vane's horizontal strike by tripping over a cobblestone.\",\n      \"Artie triggered a Critical Hit with Percussive Maintenance to collapse a stack of crates, blocking the alleyway.\",\n      \"Artie escaped to a residential backstreet, where his Aggro Meter began to decrease from its peak of 96%.\",\n      \"Vane was left behind in the alley, frustrated and intrigued by Artie's survival.\",\n      \"location: Oakhaven -
