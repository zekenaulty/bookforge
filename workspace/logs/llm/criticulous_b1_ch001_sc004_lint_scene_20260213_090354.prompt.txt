# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
Prose hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative ("left hand", "right hand", "Artie", "his wallet").
Item naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.
Appearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Continuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.
UI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says "always include".
Continuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.
Durable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.
JSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.
Inventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it unless explicitly removing a stale fact with REMOVE and restating the current truth.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

﻿Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.
Durable vs ephemeral mechanics:
- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.
- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.
- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).
- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.
For durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
For durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).
Use canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.
- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.
  - INVALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": {"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}
  - VALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": [{"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}]


USER:

# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Classify UI/prose mechanic claims as DURABLE or EPHEMERAL before enforcing.
  - DURABLE: persistent stats/caps, skills/titles acquired, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, named mechanics referenced as invariants.
  - EPHEMERAL: roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat telemetry.
- Enforce DURABLE claims against authoritative_surfaces/state/registries.
- EPHEMERAL claims do not require state ownership; only flag EPHEMERAL contradictions inside the same scene as warnings.
- UI gate:
  - If scene_card.ui_allowed=false and any authoritative UI blocks appear, emit issue code 'ui_gate_violation' (severity depends on lint mode).
  - If ui_allowed is missing and UI blocks appear, emit 'ui_gate_unknown' (warning) requesting explicit ui_allowed; do not fail solely for missing flag.
  - Inline bracketed UI (e.g., [HP: 1/1]) is still UI and should be gated the same way; do not embed UI mid-sentence.
- If uncertain, default to EPHEMERAL (warning at most), not DURABLE (error).
- status="fail" only if there is at least one issue with severity="error"; warnings alone => status="pass".
- Item naming enforcement scope:
  - Do not require that every mention in narrative prose use display_name.
  - Enforce canonical display_name for: (a) anchoring at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences),
    (b) any custody-change sentence (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer), and (c) any case where a descriptor is ambiguous among multiple durable items in the scene.
  - Otherwise, treat non-canonical descriptive references as warnings at most.
- Prose hygiene: flag internal ids or container codes in narrative prose (CHAR_, ITEM_, THREAD_, DEVICE_, hand_left, hand_right).
- Naming severity policy:
  - warning: unambiguous descriptor used post-anchor.
  - error: missing anchor, descriptor used during custody-change without canonical name, or ambiguity risk.

- Appearance enforcement (authoritative surface):
  - APPEARANCE_CHECK is authoritative for cast_present_ids.
  - Compare APPEARANCE_CHECK tokens to appearance_current atoms/marks (alias-aware).
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK contradicts appearance_current, emit error code "appearance_mismatch".
  - Prose-only appearance contradictions are warnings unless explicitly durable and uncorrected in-scene.
  - If prose depicts a durable appearance change but scene_card.durable_appearance_changes does not include it and no appearance_updates are present, emit error code "appearance_change_undeclared".
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK is missing for a cast member, emit warning code "appearance_check_missing".
- For authoritative surfaces, prefer exact canonical item/device labels from registries.
- For milestone repetition/future checks, compare against PRE-INVARIANTS only (pre-scene canon).
- For ownership/consistency checks, compare against POST-STATE (post-patch candidate).
- POST-STATE is canonical; character_states is a derived convenience view. If they contradict, emit pipeline_state_incoherent.
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).
  - Ignore first-person pronouns inside quoted dialogue; only narration counts.
- Deterministically enforce scene-card durable constraints (required_in_custody, required_scene_accessible, forbidden_visible, device_presence; optional required_visible_on_page).
- Durable constraint evaluation must use POST-STATE candidate (after patch), not pre-state.
- Report missing durable context ids with explicit retry hints instead of guessing canon.
- Input consistency check (mandatory, before issuing continuity/durable errors):
  - If MUST_STAY_TRUE invariants contradict the provided post-patch candidate character state, treat this as an upstream snapshot error.
  - In that case emit a single error issue with code "pipeline_state_incoherent" including evidence of the invariant and the conflicting state field.
  - Do NOT emit additional continuity errors for the same fields when pipeline_state_incoherent is present.
- must_stay_true removals:
  - Lines starting with "REMOVE:" are deletion directives, not invariants.
  - Ignore REMOVE lines when checking contradictions.
  - If a REMOVE directive targets a fact, treat that fact as non-canonical even if it appears earlier in must_stay_true.
- If pipeline_state_incoherent is present, issues MUST contain exactly one issue.
- For each issue, include evidence when possible (line number + excerpt) as {"evidence": {"line": N, "excerpt": "..."}}.
- Evaluate consistency over the full scope of the scene, not a single snapshot.
  - Transitional state: a temporary mismatch later corrected or superseded within this scene.
  - Durable violation: a mismatch that persists through the end of the scene or ends unresolved.
  - You MUST read the entire scene and build a minimal timeline of explicit state claims/updates (UI lines, inventory changes, title/skill changes, location/time claims).
  - If you detect an apparent inconsistency, you MUST search forward for later updates that resolve or supersede it.
  - Only produce FAIL for durable violations. If resolved within the scene, do NOT FAIL; at most emit a warning.
  - When the same stat appears multiple times, the last occurrence in the scene is authoritative unless an explicit rollback is stated.
  - Any durability violation must cite both the conflicting line and the lack of later correction (or state "no later correction found").

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity
- evidence

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The Lesser Puddle Slime didn’t have a face, but Artie could feel its judgment. It wobbled with a rhythmic, wet thrum, its translucent green body pulsing as it prepared to turn Artie’s one and only Hit Point into a memory. 

Artie’s back hit the thicket of thorns. The sharp pricks through his rumpled dress shirt were a reminder that the environment was just as lethal as the monster. He had ninety-five stamina and a dream of not dying in a tutorial.

The slime lunged.

Artie threw himself to the right, his dress shoes skidding on the damp grass. He felt the rush of cold, gelatinous air as the slime sailed past his shoulder, slamming into the thorns with a squelch.

[Stamina: 90/100]

"My turn," Artie wheezed, clenching his fist. The vending machine scar on his right knuckle throbbed. He swung a desperate haymaker at the puddle as it tried to untangle itself from the briars.

His fist passed through empty air. The slime had flattened itself like a pancake, the blow whistling harmlessly over its jiggly surface.

[Attack Missed!]

"Okay, warm-up. That was a warm-up," Artie muttered. He stepped back, trying to find his footing. The slime reformed, spinning like a top. It launched again, a low-altitude strike aimed at his ankles. Artie hopped over it, the effort sending a jolt of fatigue through his legs.

[Stamina: 85/100]

He pivoted and kicked. Or tried to. His foot connected with nothing but a stray leaf. The slime had rolled to the side with the grace of a professional gymnast made of Jell-O.

[Attack Missed!]

"Are you kidding me? It’s a puddle! How does a puddle have better evasion than a Junior Analyst?"

The slime didn't answer. It just bubbled. Artie lunged forward, trying a double-handed overhead smash. He put his whole weight into it, his Corporate ID Badge swinging wildly against his chest. The slime simply shifted its mass, creating a hole in the center of its body. Artie’s hands passed through the gap, and he nearly face-planted into the dirt.

[Attack Missed!]

[Stamina: 75/100]

"Three. That’s three," Artie gasped. He was starting to sweat. The humidity of the Lush Forest was doing no favors for his cotton shirt. The slime was circling him now, its green core glowing with a faint, predatory light. It hissed—a sound like a leaky radiator—and sprayed a glob of acidic bile.

Artie dove, rolling across the roots of a massive oak tree. The bile hit the wood behind him, hissing as it ate through the bark.

[Stamina: 70/100]

He came up swinging. A quick jab, the kind he’d seen in movies. The slime bobbed.

[Attack Missed!]

"Four!" Artie screamed. "I am literally a statistical impossibility! I have a hundred percent crit rate! I just need to touch you!"

The slime seemed to pause, its entire body vibrating. It looked like it was laughing. It began to bounce in place, a mocking, rubbery taunt. Artie felt a vein throb in his temple. He rushed in, swinging a wild, uncoordinated roundhouse punch. The slime ducked. It didn't even move far; it just lowered its profile by an inch, and Artie’s fist sailed over it yet again.

[Attack Missed!]

[Stamina: 60/100]

Artie stopped. His chest heaved. He looked at his hand—the one with the vending machine scar. He looked at the slime, which was now preparing for what looked like a final, high-velocity leap. 

"Fine," Artie whispered. "You want to play the RNG game? Let’s talk about the margin of error."

The slime launched. It was a perfect strike, aimed directly at Artie’s heart. In mid-air, it expanded, its body forming a wide net of corrosive slime designed to ensure there was no escape.

Artie didn't move. He waited until the green translucence filled his vision, until he could smell the ozone and rot. Then, he didn't punch. He didn't kick. He simply stepped forward and met the slime with a firm, rigid palm strike, right into the center of its glowing core.

The world didn't just make a sound; it ceased to have a medium for sound.

[CRITICAL HIT!]
[Calculating Damage...]
[Error: Value Exceeds Local Variable Limits]
[Statistical Anomaly Bonus Applied: 'The Glitch']
[Damage Dealt: 9,999,999,999 (Overkill!)]

A pillar of pure, white light erupted from Artie’s palm. The Lesser Puddle Slime didn't splatter; it ceased to exist at a molecular level. The force of the blow didn't stop there. The shockwave tore through the air, a localized vacuum that shrieked as it expanded. 

Behind the space where the slime had been, a massive, ancient tree—a trunk at least four feet thick—simply evaporated. There was no falling timber, no cracking wood. One moment it was a stalwart of the forest, and the next, there was a perfectly circular hole in the canopy and a scorched patch of earth where the roots used to be.

Silence returned to the forest, save for the sound of Artie’s heavy breathing and the faint clinking of his Corporate ID Badge.

Artie stared at his hand. It wasn't even singed.

[System Notification: Enemy Defeated!]
[Lesser Puddle Slime (Lvl 1) has been deleted from the database.]
[Experience Gained: 500 (Tutorial Bonus Applied)]

[LEVEL UP!]
[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon: Level 1 -> Level 2]
[All Resources Restored.]

[Stat Points Gained: 5]
[Skill Points Gained: 1]

"Holy... crap," Artie breathed. He reached into his pocket and felt the cool, glass surface of his Cracked Smartphone. It was still there. He was still here.

[Warning: Reality Stability decreased to 44%. Please refrain from divide-by-zero combat maneuvers.]

Artie ignored the warning. He watched as his HP bar remained at a steady, terrifying 1/1, but his stamina bar surged back to full. He felt a strange, tingling warmth in his limbs—the sensation of growth, or perhaps just the lingering radiation of a billion-damage punch.

"I think," Artie said to the empty forest, "I'm going to like being an anomaly."
