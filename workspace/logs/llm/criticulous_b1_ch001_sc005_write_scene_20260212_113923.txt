PROSE:

The smoke rising from the vitrified dirt smelled like burnt sugar and ozone. I stood at the epicenter of a hundred-yard trench, a perfectly straight scar of blackened earth that had replaced a significant portion of the Whispering Woods. My finger hovered over a glowing blue icon vibrating in the air.

[Level Up! You are now Level 2]
[Stat Points Available: 5]
[Skill Points Available: 1]

"I need to put these into something before a squirrel breathes on me," I muttered. My heart was hammering against my ribs, a reminder that my lanky frame was currently held together by exactly one hit point. One. A stiff breeze was a boss mechanic.

"Ooh, look at you! Level two and already a domestic terrorist," Fizz chirped, her neon pink hair leaving trails of digital sparks as she zipped around my head. She reached into her satchel and pulled out a heavy, leather-bound volume. "The Guide says level two is when most players find their first pair of pants. You, however, seem to have found a way to violate the Geneva Convention."

"It was an accident, Fizz. The math glitched."

"The System doesn't call it a glitch, Artie. It calls it 'Optimization'."

[System Notification: Optimization Complete]
[Map Sector 4-B has been cleared of redundant biological assets. Calculation time: 0.0004s]
[Performance Review: S-Rank (Efficiency)]

"Redundant biological assets?" I looked at the smoldering remains of what used to be a very pretty grove of trees. "You mean the forest? And the slime?"

"And probably a few very confused dryads," Fizz added, flipping through The Noob's Guide to Not Dying. "But hey, the System appreciates the hustle. Look, it’s giving you a prize!"

A chime, bright and mocking, echoed through the clearing. A heavy, gold-painted object materialized directly into my right hand. 

[Reward Issued: Participation Trophy]

I looked down. The Participation Trophy was a gaudy, gold-plated statue of a slime with a confused expression, mounted on a faux-marble base. A small brass plaque on the front read: *I Survived the Math.*

"A participation trophy?" I lifted the heavy thing. It felt like it weighed ten pounds. "I vaporized a hundred yards of reality and I get a 'You Tried' sticker?"

"Read the fine print, Artie. In this game, 'Participation' is a threat."

[Item: Participation Trophy (Cursed)]
[Type: Accessory / Monster Lure]
[Description: Awarded to entities whose presence is statistically negligible but physically disruptive. You’re not a hero, but you sure are loud.]
[Effect: 'The Center of Attention' - Increases monster aggro radius by 400%. All nearby entities are now aware of your exact coordinates and your lack of defensive stats.]

A low, guttural growl vibrated through the air, coming from the un-scorched edge of the woods. Then another. And a chittering sound that sounded like a thousand teeth grinding together.

"Fizz," I said, my voice dropping an octave. "What is that?"

"That would be the 'Center of Attention' effect kicking in," she said, her glowing violet eyes wide as she checked a new UI element appearing in my vision.

[Aggro Meter: 15% - Mildly Interesting]

"I need to spend these points. Now." I stabbed my finger at the 'Agility' button on the floating menu. If I couldn't have health, I needed speed. 

[Warning: Stat allocation interrupted by environmental threat.]

"What? No! Confirm! Confirm Agility!"

[Aggro Meter: 42% - Socially Significant]

"Artie, the Guide has a section on this!" Fizz shouted, hovering over my shoulder. "Chapter 4, Section 2: 'If you find yourself the target of an entire ecosystem, try to blend in.' Do you have any camouflage? Maybe you can pretend to be a very lanky, very terrified tree?"

"I am holding a glowing gold trophy that literally screams 'Kill Me' to everything with a pulse!" I yelled, swiping frantically at the menu. The 'Confirm' button kept sliding away every time the ground shook.

[Aggro Meter: 78% - Local Celebrity]

The bushes at the edge of the trench exploded. Three Level 4 Dire Wolves, their fur matted with burrs and their eyes glowing with a predatory red light, skidded onto the blackened earth. Behind them, a swarm of Level 3 Needle-Wasps began to pour out of the canopy like a funnel cloud of hate.

"Fizz, the book! Give me something useful!"

"Uh, let's see... 'If surrounded by apex predators, remember that you are also made of meat, which is a valuable resource'—no, that’s the Chef’s Guide—here! 'Chapter 12: Running is a valid tactical choice for those who enjoy living.'"

[Aggro Meter: 99% - Trending Topic]

[System Notification: Combat State Re-Initialized]
[Current HP: 1/1]
[Warning: You are currently being targeted by 14 unique entities.]

"Fourteen?" I looked behind the wolves. The shadows of the trees were moving. A lot of shadows.

I didn't wait for the wolves to charge. I tucked the Participation Trophy under my arm like a football and bolted down the center of the trench. It was the only clear path—a straight shot toward what I hoped was the exit of this nightmare tutorial zone.

"Run, Artie! The Guide says the wolves have a pounce range of six meters!" Fizz screamed, flying alongside me. "Also, you're breathing wrong! The Guide recommends rhythmic diaphragmatic breathing for optimal flight-from-death!"

"I'll breathe... when I'm... not... a snack!" I wheezed. 

Behind me, the howling intensified. The sound of paws thundering on the vitrified soil was getting louder. I risked a glance over my shoulder and saw the lead wolf's jaws snapping inches from where my heels had been a second ago.

[Stamina: 45/100]
[Aggro Meter: MAX]

"The exit!" Fizz pointed toward a break in the trees where the trench ended and a faint stone path began. "Just reach the path! Monsters usually respect regional boundaries for some reason!"

"I hope... they read... the same... manual!"

I pushed my legs harder, my lanky frame straining as the swarm of Needle-Wasps began to dive-bomb my head. I swung the Participation Trophy blindly behind me, the gold-plated slime clunking against something hard and chitinous.

[Critical Hit! -12 HP (Needle-Wasp)]
[Note: That was lucky. Don't do it again.]

"I'm trying!" I yelled, the exit of the Whispering Woods looming ahead of me as a tide of fur and stingers surged at my back.
