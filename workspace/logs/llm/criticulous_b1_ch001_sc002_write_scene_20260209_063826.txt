PROSE:

The blue light of the Character Creation Suite didn't just glow; it hummed with the judgmental frequency of a middle-manager watching you take a long lunch. Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stood—or rather, floated in a vaguely upright posture—before a translucent wall of floating windows that looked like the offspring of a spreadsheet and a fever dream.

"Can we speed this up? I have a three-o'clock with a guy who died trying to parkour off a moving train, and honestly, his stats are already looking more promising than yours," a voice piped up from somewhere near Artie’s left ear.

Artie turned his head—which felt like moving a bowling ball through molasses—to see a small, flickering sprite. She looked like a pixie made of corrupted pixels and pure sass, wearing a miniature uniform that suggested she was either a flight attendant for the afterlife or a very high-ranking customer service representative.

"You're the System?" Artie asked, his voice echoing in the neon void.

"I'm Fizz. Your Guide. Think of me as the tutorial pop-up you usually click 'Skip' on, except I can actually feel it when you're being an idiot," she said, crossing her tiny arms. "Now, look at the screen. You’ve got a 'Compensation Package' because the Vending Machine Incident was flagged as 'Statistically Improbable Malfunction.' You’ve got one hundred Attribute Points. Spend them before I start charging you for the air you aren't currently breathing."

Artie looked back at the UI. It was a mess of sliders and checkboxes.

[Character Name: Arthur Penhaligon]
[Race: Human (Basic/Boring)]
[Class: UNASSIGNED]
[HP: 0/100 (Status: Deceased)]
[Attribute Points: 100]

[STATS]
- [Strength: 10]
- [Agility: 10]
- [Intelligence: 10]
- [Constitution: 10]
- [Luck: 1]
- [Critical Hit Rate: 0.01%]

"Okay, okay," Artie muttered. "Constitution seems important. I’d like to not die again. Dying was... unpleasant. Very tingly. Zero stars."

He reached out a translucent hand toward the 'Constitution' slider. His fingers felt numb, a lingering side effect of the several thousand volts that had recently reorganized his nervous system. As he tried to grab the slider to pump his HP back into the triple digits, the UI flickered. 

"Wait, why is it jumping?" Artie asked, his hand spasming.

"The Void has a bit of latency," Fizz said, inspecting her fingernails. "Or maybe it’s just your soul’s lingering trauma from the 'Cool Ranch' short circuit. Either way, move faster. I’m losing my 'Patient Guide' buff and it’s about to be replaced by 'Sarcastic Bystander.'"

Artie tried to steady his hand. He meant to slide Constitution to fifty. He really did. But as he lunged for the bar, the entire UI shifted to the right. His finger caught the edge of the 'Critical Hit Rate' slider instead.

"Whoa!"

The slider didn't just move; it slammed to the far right with a sound like a jackpot hitting on a slot machine.

[Critical Hit Rate: 100%]
[Remaining Attribute Points: 0]

"Uh," Artie said, staring at the screen. "Is that... supposed to happen?"

Fizz flew closer, her pixelated wings buzzing. She squinted at the screen. "Did you just... you did. You put every single point into Crit. You didn't even touch Agility. Or Strength. Or, you know, the stat that keeps your heart beating."

"I can fix it," Artie said, his voice rising in panic. He reached for the 'Reset' button, but his finger slipped again, brushing against the 'Confirm Build' prompt that had appeared in the center of his vision.

[System Notification: Build Confirmed!]
[Recalculating physical integrity based on selected attributes...]
[Warning: Constitution remains at base level (10) with severe 'Deceased' penalty applied.]
[Warning: HP has been capped to minimum viable threshold.]

"No, no, no! Undo! Ctrl-Z! Where is the Ctrl-Z?" Artie shouted, poking at the air.

"There is no Ctrl-Z in the afterlife, Penhaligon," Fizz sighed, her voice dripping with a mix of pity and dark amusement. "You just locked in a build with the durability of a wet paper towel and the offensive potential of a supernova. You’re essentially a glass cannon, except the glass is already cracked."

[System Notification: Title Acquired!]
[Title: Crit or Quit]
[Description: You have achieved the impossible—a 100% Critical Hit rate at Level 1. You will either vaporize your enemies or be sneezed into oblivion. There is no middle ground.]
[Effect: All successful hits are guaranteed Critical Hits. HP is permanently locked at 1. Any damage taken is fatal.]

Artie stared at the new window. 

[HP: 1/1]
[Crit Rate: 100%]

"One?" Artie whispered. "I have one hit point? I’ve had paper cuts more threatening than my entire life force."

"On the bright side," Fizz said, patting him on the shoulder—which felt like a static shock—"you’ll never have to worry about long-term healthcare. If anything touches you, you're just... gone. It’s very efficient, really."

"Efficiency isn't the word I’d use," Artie groaned. He looked down at his hands. They were starting to solidify, turning from ghostly blue to a pale, fleshy tone. The void around him began to fragment, the neon lines of the Character Creation Suite dissolving into the rough textures of a forest floor.

"Wait, I'm not ready! I need to re-spec! Give me a survey! I'll give you a bad review!"

"Review all you want," Fizz said, her form becoming more distinct as the world stabilized. She pulled a small, leather-bound book from a satchel at her hip—the Standard Guide's Manual. "But you’re live, Artie. Welcome to the world of 'Crit-iculous.' Try not to trip on a pebble. It would be a very embarrassing way to end the series in the first chapter."

[System Notification: Deployment Commencing...]
[Location: Tutorial Zone - Whispering Woods]
[Good luck, Anomaly. You're going to need it.]

Artie felt the sudden, jarring sensation of gravity. His feet hit solid dirt. He wobbled, his heart hammering against his ribs—a single, fragile beat that represented his entire existence. 

"One HP," he muttered, looking at the floating red '1' in the corner of his vision. "I'm a walking game-over screen."

"And a walking miracle," Fizz added, hovering just above his head. "Now, look alive. Or as alive as one point of health allows. We’ve got company."

Artie didn't even have time to ask what she meant before a low growl echoed from the bushes. His 100% Crit Rate glowed in his peripheral vision, a golden promise of power that felt more like a death sentence.
