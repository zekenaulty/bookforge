SYSTEM:

# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Mechanics contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and labels (stats/skills) must be sourced from state or explicitly updated in the state_patch. Do not invent numbers or canonical tokens.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.

Scene:
The transition from the sterile white void of character creation to the Whispering Woods didn't feel like a magical teleportation. It felt like being shoved through a keyhole by a very large, very impatient foot. Artie hit the ground with a thud that vibrated through his teeth, the smell of damp pine and digitized ozone filling his lungs.

He didn't move for a second. He just lay there, face-down in moss that felt suspiciously like recycled polyester.

"Welcome to the world of *Crit-iculous*," Fizz’s voice drifted down, dripping with a level of sarcasm that could probably erode granite. "Try not to die in the first thirty seconds. It makes the paperwork a nightmare, and I’ve already reached my quota for 'idiots who fell off the spawn platform' this fiscal quarter."

Artie groaned, pushing himself up. As he did, a translucent red bar flickered into existence in the upper-left corner of his vision. It was so thin it looked like a stray hair caught on his cornea. 

[HP: 1 / 1]
[MP: 1 / 1]

"One," Artie whispered, his voice cracking. "It’s really just one."

"It’s a very sturdy one," Fizz said, hovering a few feet away. She was tapping away at her Data Slate, the blue light of the screen reflecting off her wings. "Technically, it's a whole number. It’s significantly better than zero. Although, in this zone, the difference between one and zero is usually about three kilograms of force or a particularly aggressive sneeze."

Artie stood up, dusting off his Linen Tunic. He felt light. Too light. His Strength was at the absolute minimum the System allowed without him collapsing into a puddle of sentient meat. He reached down and gripped the hilt of the Broken Tutorial Sword strapped to his hip, drawing it with a metallic *shink* that sounded far more heroic than the weapon looked. It was a jagged piece of rusted iron that looked like it had been used to pry open crates for a decade before being handed to him.

"Right," Artie said, trying to find his center. "One hundred percent crit rate. That’s the plan. I just need to hit them before they hit me."

"A bold strategy, Cotton," Fizz muttered, not looking up from her slate. "Let’s see how it plays out against the local wildlife."

The Whispering Woods lived up to its name, but not in the way the travel brochures probably described. The wind didn't rustle the leaves; it hissed through them in a way that sounded like thousands of overlapping voices reciting patch notes. *...fixed a bug where squirrels could phase through reality... increased drop rate for low-quality acorns... optimized shadow rendering for predatory bushes...*

The trees themselves were massive, gnarled things with bark that looked like charred circuit boards. The light filtering through the canopy was a sickly, neon-tinged green, casting long, jittery shadows that seemed to move a fraction of a second after the branches did. It was a beautiful place, if you liked your nature with a side of existential dread and a high probability of mechanical failure.

Artie took a step forward, his boots crunching on a fallen branch.

[System Notification: Stealth Check Failed!]
[Reason: You have the grace of a caffeinated toddler in a room full of bubble wrap.]

"Oh, that’s helpful," Artie snapped. "Thanks, System."

"Don't blame the System for your lack of Agility," Fizz said, floating alongside him. "You’re the one who decided that 'moving quietly' was a luxury you couldn't afford. You’re basically a walking dinner bell for anything with ears. Or vibrations. Or a general sense of hunger."

A low, wet sound echoed from behind a cluster of glowing ferns. It was a rhythmic, pulsing noise, like a giant heart beating inside a bucket of mayonnaise. Artie froze, his hand tightening on the hilt of his broken sword.

"Is that...?"

"That," Fizz said, finally stowing her Data Slate and crossing her arms, "is your first lesson in humility. Or your last lesson in existence. It’s a toss-up, really."

The ferns parted, and a Level 1 Slime wobbled into the clearing. 

It wasn't the cute, bouncy mascot from a classic JRPG. It was a translucent, lime-green mass of semi-solid sludge, about the size of a beach ball and twice as heavy. Inside its gelatinous body, Artie could see the half-dissolved remains of a tutorial handbook and what looked like a very surprised-looking crow. Two black, bead-like eyes drifted lazily within the goo, eventually settling on Artie.

[Tutorial Slime - Lvl 1]
[HP: 10/10]
[Status: Aggressive]

The slime didn't roar. It just... vibrated. The sound was a low-frequency hum that made Artie’s 1 HP feel even more precarious. 

"Okay," Artie said, his heart hammering against his ribs. "It’s Level 1. I can do this. I have a sword. I have the crits."

"You also have the durability of a wet paper towel in a hurricane," Fizz reminded him. "Just a friendly reminder: that slime’s 'Passive Ooze' aura deals 0.1 damage per second to anything within a one-meter radius. Since the System rounds up for damage calculations..."

Artie’s eyes widened. "Wait, what?"

"Math is a cruel mistress, Artie," Fizz said with a grin. "If it touches you, you’re dead. If you stand too close for too long, you’re dead. If it spits on you, you’re dead. Honestly, if it just looks at you with enough intensity, I might have to start looking for a new assignment."

The slime lunged. 

It wasn't a fast movement, but it was relentless. It gathered its mass and threw itself forward in a wet, heavy flop. Artie scrambled backward, his heel catching on a root. He flailed, his arms windmilling as he barely kept his balance. The slime landed exactly where he had been standing a second ago, the ground sizzling slightly where the ooze touched the moss.

"Missed!" Artie shouted, his voice an octave higher than usual.

"By about three inches," Fizz noted. "Your heart rate is currently 140 BPM. If it hits 160, I think your 1 HP might just give up out of sheer stress."

Artie didn't respond. He was too busy watching the slime. It was already re-orienting itself, the green sludge rippling as it prepared for another lunge. Artie held the broken sword out in front of him, his hands shaking. He needed to time this. One hit. That was all it would take. With his 100% Crit Rate, even a 1 Strength punch with a broken sword should be enough to vaporize a Level 1 mob.

But he had to get close.

And getting close meant entering the 'Passive Ooze' zone.

"Fizz, how far is a meter?" Artie asked, his eyes locked on the slime’s bead-like eyes.

"About three of your very shaky steps," she replied. "Or one very confident lunge. Which, given your current state, I wouldn't recommend."

The slime wobbled again, its entire body pulsing with a sickly light. It was faster this time. It didn't just flop; it launched itself, a glob of green slime detaching from its main body like a projectile. 

Artie ducked, the glob whistling over his head and slamming into a tree behind him. The bark hissed and began to melt, the 'Whispering' of the tree turning into a distorted, high-pitched scream of *ERROR: CORRUPT TEXTURE DATA*.

"It has a ranged attack?" Artie yelled, scrambling to his feet.

"It’s a slime, Artie. They’re 90% projectile," Fizz said. She was now hovering upside down, looking bored. "Honestly, the fact that you’re still alive is a statistical anomaly in itself. The System is probably already trying to figure out which sub-routine it needs to run to fix you."

Artie backed away, but he was running out of clearing. Behind him, the gnarled roots of a 'Patch-Note Oak' rose up like a wall, their jagged edges looking just as lethal as the slime. He was being hemmed in. To his left, a thicket of thorns that hummed with static electricity; to his right, a steep drop into a ravine filled with purple fog.

The slime moved again, cutting off his only clear path back toward the spawn point. It was moving with a strange, predatory intelligence, its gelatinous body stretching out to cover more ground.

Artie looked at his peripheral vision again. 

[HP: 1 / 1]

The red bar seemed to be mocking him. It was a reminder that he was a glitch in the matrix, a mistake that the world was currently trying to erase. One point of damage. That was all it would take. A single drop of acid, a stray thorn, a fall of more than two feet.

"I can't dodge forever," Artie muttered, his back hitting the cold, metallic bark of the tree. 

"Correct," Fizz said, floating closer. Her snarky expression softened just a fraction, though her voice remained sharp. "You’re a glass cannon, Artie. But right now, you’re just the glass. If you want to be the cannon, you have to actually fire."

The slime gathered itself for a final lunge. It distended, its green body growing thin and taut like a rubber band being pulled to its breaking point. The two black eyes stared at Artie, reflecting his own terrified face.

Artie gripped the Broken Tutorial Sword. His knuckles were white. The air in the Whispering Woods felt heavy, the whispers of the trees reaching a fever pitch as they anticipated the 'Deletion' event. 

[Warning: Enemy is charging a Heavy Attack!]
[Probability of Survival: 0.0001%]

"Shut up," Artie hissed at the notification. 

The slime launched. It was a wall of green death, a solid mass of corrosive sludge flying through the air with the weight of a bowling ball. Artie had nowhere to go. He was cornered, his back against the tree, the jagged roots pinning him in place. 

He raised the sword, but his arms felt like lead. The 1 Strength stat was a heavy burden to carry when your life depended on a single, perfect swing. 

"Come on," Artie breathed, the world slowing down as the slime closed the distance. "Just one hit. Just one damn hit."

The slime was inches away, the smell of its rot filling his nostrils, the heat of its acid beginning to prickle against his skin. Artie swung, not with strength, but with the desperation of a man who had already died once and really didn't want to make a habit of it.

The broken blade cut through the air, trailing a faint, golden light—the signature of a guaranteed Critical Hit.

But the slime was already mid-air, its mass shifting, its trajectory aimed directly at Artie’s chest.

"Artie!" Fizz shouted, her snark finally replaced by genuine alarm.

The sword connected with the outer membrane of the slime, but the momentum of the creature didn't stop. It was a collision course, and Artie was the only one with everything to lose.
