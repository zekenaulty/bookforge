  "text": "PROSE:\nThe descent from the foothills was a slow-motion catastrophe of sliding obsidian and grinding bone. Kaelen didn't walk into the Silver Valley so much as he negotiated a desperate truce with the wreckage of it. Every time his boots struck the slope, the earth yielded not with the soft give of mountain soil, but with the brittle, high-pitched scream of shattering glass. The star had not simply hit the ground; it had rewritten the valley\u2019s chemistry. Where there had once been a carpet of alpine grass and the silver-leafed aspens that gave the place its name, there was now a jagged, translucent sea. The impact had flash-melted the silica in the soil, freezing the shockwave into a crown of solidified glass that rippled outward in concentric circles of bruised violet and sickly amber.\n\nKaelen\u2019s left arm throbbed with a cold, rhythmic heat that had nothing to do with the freezing mountain air. The Starwrought Oath was not a metaphor or a spiritual bond; it was a physical length of star-forged pewter, a celestial filament woven directly into the marrow of his radius bone. Now, that physical anchor was a jagged ruin. Inside the bone, the filament had snapped into a dozen dark splinters that ground against his nerves with every movement. It felt as if a hair-thin wire of frozen lead was being twisted by a pair of rusted pliers. Every shift of his weight, every frantic grab at a glass-slick ledge for balance, sent a fresh surge of frost-burn through his shoulder.\n\nHe paused, his breath hitching in lungs that felt as though they had been scrubbed with lye. The air here was wrong. It tasted of ozone and old, wet copper, thick enough to coat the tongue. He looked up at the High Spire, a dark needle silhouetted against the star-choked sky, tilting at an impossible angle. It looked fragile, a child\u2019s toy discarded on a shelf of broken mirrors. There was no going back. The wards were gone, and the silence from the Spire was the silence of a tomb.\n\nHe turned his gaze back to the center of the crater. The light there was different\u2014not the reflected shimmer of the stars above, but a deep, internal throb. It beat like a heart, a low-frequency vibration that he felt in his teeth more than he heard in his ears. Thump-hiss. Thump-hiss.\n\nKaelen stepped onto the floor of the valley proper. The glass here was razor-edged, the shards standing up like the teeth of a buried beast. He moved with a hunter\u2019s caution, placing his feet in the hollows between the ridges. Even so, the hem of his heavy wool cloak caught on a protrusion, the fabric parting with a clean, surgical snip. He didn't stop to check the damage. The cold in his arm was deepening, turning from an ache into a numbing void that threatened to lock his fingers into a permanent claw.\n\n\"Hold together,\" he hissed, his voice a dry rasp. He wasn't sure if he was talking to himself or the fractured metal in his bone.\n\nAs he neared the impact point, the transparency of the glass changed. It became opaque, clouded with swirls of dark matter that looked like ink dropped into clear water. The rhythmic beat grew louder, a physical pressure that seemed to push against his chest, trying to sync his own heart to its alien tempo. The ground began to slope upward again, forming a central mound where the star had finally come to rest. Here, the glass hadn't just shattered; it had been sculpted by the heat into grotesque, flowering shapes. Petals of translucent violet stone curved upward, ten feet tall, forming a jagged chalice around the impact site.\n\nKaelen climbed. He used his right hand to haul himself up, his boots slipping on the vitreous surface. Twice, he slid back, the glass slicing through the tough leather of his gloves. He ignored the warm wetness of blood; in this cold, it would tack his skin to the stone soon enough. He reached the rim of the central chalice and looked down.\n\nThe crater floor was a smooth, polished bowl of deep violet light. At its center lay the shard. It wasn't large\u2014perhaps the size of a man\u2019s head\u2014but it possessed a density that seemed to warp the very space around it. It wasn't solid, not exactly. It looked like a knot of solidified smoke, a crystalline lattice that shifted and roiled internally. A bruised, violet radiance spilled from its core, casting long, dancing shadows against the walls of the glass bowl.\n\nAnd it was beating.\n\nThe rhythm was undeniable now. With every pulse of light, the shard expanded and contracted by a fraction of a millimeter. The sound it made was the sound of a heavy door closing in a deep cellar\u2014a dull, resonant thud that vibrated through the glass beneath Kaelen\u2019s feet. He felt a sudden, violent spasm in his left wrist. The physical filament of the Oath reacted to the shard\u2019s proximity like a compass needle near a lightning strike. The pewter thread beneath his skin flared with a dull, dying light, visible through the pale flesh of his arm. The pain was blinding, a white-hot spike driven through the center of his palm.\n\nKaelen collapsed to his knees, clutching his arm. He gasped for air, but the atmosphere inside the bowl was thin and scorched. His vision swam. For a moment, he wasn't in the Silver Valley. He was back in the High Spire, standing before the Great Ward-Ring, watching the iron turn to liquid as the sky fell. He saw the face of Commander Varkas, eyes wide with a reflected violet fire, his mouth open in a silent scream as the void-frost took him.\n\nHe blinked, shaking his head. The hallucination receded, leaving only the cold and the thumping heart of the star. It\u2019s calling, he realized. Not to the world. To the Oath.\n\nThe Starwrought Oath wasn't just a vow; it was a physical tether. For centuries, his order had been the anchors, the points of contact between the celestial and the terrestrial. They held the stars in their places, and in return, they were granted the light to hold back the dark. But the tether was broken. The anchor was dragging.\n\nHe forced himself to stand. His legs felt like lead, and his left arm was entirely dead weight now, hanging uselessly at his side. He began the final descent into the bowl. The air grew warmer as he approached the shard, but it was an uncomfortable, humid heat\u2014the heat of a fever. The smell of copper intensified, mixed now with something sweet and cloying, like rotting lilies.\n\nHe stopped a few feet from the object. Up close, the shard was terrifyingly beautiful. The internal smoke was composed of millions of tiny, needle-like structures, constantly rearranging themselves. It was a machine of pure geometry, a piece of a world that didn't obey the laws of his own. Kaelen reached out with his right hand. His fingers trembled. He knew the cost of touching raw star-stuff without a stable Oath to buffer the transition. It would burn. It would hollow him out. It might turn his blood to glass.\n\nBut the Spire was falling, the Order was dead, and the shadow-forms were already prowling the edges of the valley. This shard was the only thing left that had the weight to pull him out of the ruins.\n\n\"By the Weaver\u2019s hand,\" he whispered, invoking a god he no longer believed in.\n\nHe lunged forward and closed his hand around the shard. The world vanished in a scream of violet light. The impact was not physical, but metaphysical. It felt as if his entire nervous system had been plugged into a sun. The fractured Oath in his arm didn't just throb; it shrieked. The pewter filament buckled, the splinters of his broken vow driven deep into his very soul. He couldn't breathe. He couldn't scream. He was a vessel being filled with a pressure that exceeded his volume.\n\nThe shard\u2019s heartbeat became his own. Thump-hiss. Thump-hiss.\n\nImages flickered through his mind at a speed that defied comprehension: stars collapsing into black pearls, silver webs stretching across the void, a great, multi-eyed beast watching from the dark between the constellations. He felt the loneliness of the shard\u2014a fragment of a dying consciousness, reaching out for anything to hold onto.\n\nKaelen\u2019s grip tightened. He refused to let go. He felt the skin of his palm blistering, the scent of his own scorched flesh rising in the air, but he forced his will into the shard. He used the jagged remains of his Oath as a hook, snagging the alien energy and pulling it into the vacuum of his own fractured magic. The violet light began to recede, drawing inward, back into the crystalline lattice. The heat faded, replaced by a deep, resonant hum that settled into his bones.\n\nKaelen fell back onto the glass, gasping, his chest heaving. He was drenched in sweat despite the freezing night. He looked down at his right hand. The shard was silent now, its surface dark and matte like charcoal, but he could still feel the pulse inside it\u2014a faint, rhythmic tremor. It was bound to him.\n\nHis left arm was a map of ruin. The skin over the radius bone was bruised a deep, necrotic purple, and the pewter filament was no longer a single line. It had branched out, a web of dark, metallic veins spreading toward his elbow and his thumb. The pain had settled into a dull, permanent throb, a constant reminder of the price he had paid.\n\nBut he had it. He had the heart of the star.\n\nIn the distance, beyond the rim of the crater, a long, low howl echoed through the valley. It wasn't the sound of a wolf. It was a sound of empty spaces and hungry shadows. Kaelen tucked the shard into the heavy leather satchel at his hip, his movements jerky and uncoordinated. He used his good hand to push himself up, his eyes scanning the jagged horizon of the glass crown. The shadow-forms were coming, drawn to the light he had just extinguished.\n\nHe looked once more at the High Spire, now a broken silhouette against a sky that felt heavier than it had an hour ago. He was no longer a watchman. He was a thief, a fugitive, and perhaps the last living fragment of a broken world. He turned toward the south, toward the only path that didn't lead back to the ruins, and began the long, agonizing trek out of the glass. The shard in his bag gave a single, heavy thud against his thigh, a heartbeat in the dark.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\"CHAR_kaelen\"],\n    \"location\": \"Silver Valley - Impact Crater\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Kaelen has reached the center of the starfall crater in the Silver Valley.\",\n      \"The Silver Valley has been transformed into a crown of razor-sharp solidified glass.\",\n      \"The Starwrought Oath is a physical pewter filament in Kaelen's marrow that has fractured into dark splinters.\",\n      \"Kaelen has secured the pulsing star-shard, which is now bound to his life force.\",\n      \"Shadow-forms are closing in on Kaelen's position at the impact site.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\"THREAD_starfall_corruption\", \"THREAD_oath_binding\"]\n  },\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Kaelen navigated the treacherous glass crown of the Silver Valley to reach the impact site.\",\n      \"He discovered a pulsing violet shard that reacted violently to the physical filament of his fractured Oath.\",\n      \"Kaelen claimed the shard, enduring a blinding metaphysical surge that bound the object to his marrow-bound magic.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Kaelen descended into the Silver Valley, now a sea of flash-melted glass.\",\n      \"The physical pewter filament of the Starwrought Oath ground into Kaelen's radius bone.\",\n      \"Kaelen reached the central crater and found the star-shard beating like a heart.\",\n      \"Proximity to the shard caused the fractured Oath to flare with necrotic purple light.\",\n      \"Kaelen touched the shard, experiencing visions of a dying galaxy and a cosmic beast.\",\n      \"Kaelen secured the shard in his satchel as shadow-forms began to hunt him.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"The Starwrought Oath is a physical pewter-colored filament woven into the marrow of the radius bone.\",\n      \"Magic and star-matter proximity cause physical frost-burn, scorched lungs, and metallic scents.\",\n      \"The starfall corruption is characterized by a rhythmic 'thump-hiss' and violet light.\",\n      \"The High Spire is in a state of catastrophic collapse and tilting.\",\n      \"The shard is now tied to Kaelen's life force and Oath-essence.\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Kaelen reached the impact site and secured the pulsing star-shard, further damaging his physical Oath in the process.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"threads_touched\": [\"THREAD_starfall_corruption\", \"THREAD_oath_binding\"]\n}",

Your writing is characterized by a tight, limited third-person perspective that never breaks into omniscient narration. You must maintain strict continuity, ensuring that characters utilize their full range of established skills and knowledge. Do not use 'As you know' dialogue or provide summaries of previous events. When a scene begins, drop the reader directly into the character's current sensory experience. Avoid clich\u00e9s in descriptions; instead of 'cold as ice,' describe the 'brittle, biting snap of air that makes the lungs ache.' Ensure all plot payoffs are seeded with subtle clues in earlier movements. Magic and high-fantasy elements must have clear costs and logical consistency.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"The Silver Fracture\",\"goal\":\"Witness the starfall and establish Kaelen's failing

Kaelen didn't walk into the Silver Valley so much as he negotiated a truce with the wreckage of it. Every time his boots struck the slope, the earth yielded not with the soft give of mountain soil, but with the brittle, high-pitched scream of shattering glass. \n\nThe star had not simply hit the ground; it had rewritten the valley\u2019s chemistry. Where there had once been a carpet of alpine grass and the silver-leafed aspens that gave the place its name, there was now a jagged, translucent sea. The impact had flash-melted the silica in the soil, freezing the shockwave into a crown of solidified glass that rippled outward in concentric circles of bruised violet and sickly amber.\n\nKaelen\u2019s left arm throbbed with a cold, rhythmic heat that had nothing to do with the freezing mountain air. Inside the marrow of his radius bone, the Starwrought Oath\u2014once a steady, pewter-colored thread of celestial certainty\u2014was a jagged ruin. It felt as if a hair-thin wire of frozen lead had snapped and was now grinding its splintered ends into his nerves. Every shift of his weight, every frantic grab at a glass-slick ledge for balance, sent a fresh surge of frost-burn through his shoulder.\n\nHe paused, his breath hitching in lungs that felt as though they had been scrubbed with lye. The air here was wrong. It tasted of ozone and old, wet copper, thick enough to coat the tongue. He looked up at the High Spire, a dark needle silhouetted against the star-choked sky, tilting at an impossible angle. It looked fragile, a child\u2019s toy discarded on a shelf of broken mirrors. \n\nThere was no going back. The wards were gone, and the silence from the Spire was the silence of a tomb.\n\nHe turned his gaze back to the center of the crater. The light there was different\u2014not the reflected shimmer of the stars above, but a deep, internal throb. It beat like a heart, a low-frequency vibration that he felt in his teeth more than he heard in his ears. *Thump-hiss. Thump-hiss.*\n\nKaelen stepped onto the floor of the valley proper. The glass here was razor-edged, the shards standing up like the teeth of a buried beast. He moved with a hunter\u2019s caution, placing his feet in the hollows between the ridges. Even so, the hem of his heavy wool cloak caught on a protrusion, the fabric parting with a clean, surgical snip. He didn't stop to check the damage. The cold in his arm was deepening, turning from an ache into a numbing void that threatened to lock his fingers into a permanent claw.\n\n\"Hold together,\" he hissed, his voice a dry rasp. He wasn't sure if he was talking to himself or the fractured thread in his bone. \n\nAs he neared the impact point, the transparency of the glass changed. It became opaque, clouded with swirls of dark matter that looked like ink dropped into clear water. The rhythmic beat grew louder, a physical pressure that seemed to push against his chest, trying to sync his own heart to its alien tempo. \n\nThe ground began to slope upward again, forming a central mound where the star had finally come to rest. Here, the glass hadn't just shattered; it had been sculpted by the heat into grotesque, flowering shapes. Petals of translucent violet stone curved upward, ten feet tall, forming a jagged chalice around the impact site.\n\nKaelen climbed. He used his right hand to haul himself up, his boots slipping on the vitreous surface. Twice, he slid back, the glass slicing through the tough leather of his gloves. He ignored the warm wetness of blood; in this cold, it would tack his skin to the stone soon enough. \n\nHe reached the rim of the central chalice and looked down.\n\nThe crater floor was a smooth, polished bowl of deep violet light. At its center lay the shard.\n\nIt wasn't large\u2014perhaps the size of a man\u2019s head\u2014but it possessed a density that seemed to warp the very space around it. It wasn't solid, not exactly. It looked like a knot of solidified smoke, a crystalline lattice that shifted and roiled internally. A bruised, violet radiance spilled from its core, casting long, dancing shadows against the walls of the glass bowl.\n\nAnd it was beating.\n\nThe rhythm was undeniable now. With every pulse of light, the shard expanded and contracted by a fraction of a millimeter. The sound it made was the sound of a heavy door closing in a deep cellar\u2014a dull, resonant *thud* that vibrated through the glass beneath Kaelen\u2019s feet.\n\nHe felt a sudden, violent spasm in his left wrist. The fractured Oath reacted to the shard\u2019s proximity like a compass needle near a lightning strike. The pewter thread beneath his skin flared with a dull, dying light, visible through the pale flesh of his arm. The pain was blinding, a white-hot spike driven through the center of his palm. \n\nKaelen collapsed to his knees, clutching his arm. He gasped for air, but the atmosphere inside the bowl was thin and scorched. His vision swam. For a moment, he wasn't in the Silver Valley. He was back in the High Spire, standing before the Great Ward-Ring, watching the iron turn to liquid as the sky fell. He saw the face of Commander Varkas, eyes wide with a reflected violet fire, his mouth open in a silent scream as the void-frost took him.\n\nHe blinked, shaking his head. The hallucination receded, leaving only the cold and the thumping heart of the star.\n\n*It\u2019s calling,* he realized. *Not to the world. To the Oath.*\n\nThe Starwrought Oath wasn't just a vow; it was a tether. For centuries, his order had been the anchors, the points of contact between the celestial and the terrestrial. They held the stars in their places, and in return, they were granted the light to hold back the dark. But the tether was broken. The anchor was dragging.\n\nHe forced himself to stand. His legs felt like lead, and his left arm was entirely dead weight now, hanging uselessly at his side. He began the final descent into the bowl.\n\nThe air grew warmer as he approached the shard, but it was an uncomfortable, humid heat\u2014the heat of a fever. The smell of copper intensified, mixed now with something sweet and cloying, like rotting lilies. \n\nHe stopped a few feet from the object. Up close, the shard was terrifyingly beautiful. The internal smoke was composed of millions of tiny, needle-like structures, constantly rearranging themselves. It was a machine of pure geometry, a piece of a world that didn't obey the laws of his own.\n\nKaelen reached out with his right hand. His fingers trembled. He knew the cost of touching raw star-stuff without a stable Oath to buffer the transition. It would burn. It would hollow him out. It might turn his blood to glass.\n\nBut the Spire was falling, the Order was dead, and the shadow-forms were already prowling the edges of the valley. This shard was the only thing left that had the weight to pull him out of the ruins.\n\n\"By the Weaver\u2019s hand,\" he whispered, invoking a god he no longer believed in.\n\nHe lunged forward and closed his hand around the shard.\n\nThe world vanished in a scream of violet light.\n\nThe impact was not physical, but metaphysical. It felt as if his entire nervous system had been plugged into a sun. The fractured Oath in his arm didn't just throb; it shrieked. The pewter thread buckled, the splinters of his broken vow driven deep into his very soul. \n\nHe couldn't breathe. He couldn't scream. He was a vessel being filled with a pressure that exceeded his volume. \n\nThe shard\u2019s heartbeat became his own. *Thump-hiss. Thump-hiss.* \n\nImages flickered through his mind at a speed that defied comprehension: stars collapsing into black pearls, silver webs stretching across the void, a great, multi-eyed beast watching from the dark between the constellations. He felt the loneliness of the shard\u2014a fragment of a dying consciousness, reaching out for anything to hold onto.\n\nKaelen\u2019s grip tightened. He refused to let go. He felt the skin of his palm blistering, the scent of his own scorched flesh rising in the air, but he forced his will into the shard. He used the jagged remains of his Oath as a hook, snagging the alien energy and pulling it into the vacuum of his own fractured magic.\n\nThe violet light began to recede, drawing inward, back into the crystalline lattice. The heat faded, replaced by a deep, resonant hum that settled into his bones. \n\nKaelen fell back onto the glass, gasping, his chest heaving. He was drenched in sweat despite the freezing night. He looked down at his right hand.\n\nThe shard was silent now, its surface dark and matte like charcoal, but he could still feel the pulse inside it\u2014a faint, rhythmic tremor. It was bound to him.\n\nHis left arm was a map of ruin. The skin over the radius bone was bruised a deep, necrotic purple, and the pewter thread was no longer a single line. It had branched out, a web of dark, metallic veins spreading toward his elbow and his thumb. The pain had settled into a dull, permanent throb, a constant reminder of the price he had paid.\n\nBut he had it. He had the heart of the star.\n\nIn the distance, beyond the rim of the crater, a long, low howl echoed through the valley. It wasn't the sound of a wolf. It was a sound of empty spaces and hungry shadows.\n\nKaelen tucked the shard into the heavy leather satchel at his hip, his movements jerky and uncoordinated. He used his good hand to push himself up, his eyes scanning the jagged horizon of the glass crown. The shadow-forms were coming, drawn to the light he had just extinguished.\n\nHe looked once more at the High Spire, now a broken silhouette against a sky that felt heavier than it had an hour ago. He was no longer a watchman. He was a thief, a fugitive, and perhaps the last living fragment of a broken world.\n\nHe turned toward the south, toward the only path that didn't lead back to the ruins, and began the long, agonizing trek out of the glass. The shard in his bag gave a single, heavy thud against his thigh, a heartbeat in the dark.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 3\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_001/scene_003.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"DRAFTING\",\n  \"summary\": {\n    \"chapter_so_far\": [\n      \"Kaelen discovers the High Spire's wards are failing beyond repair and suspects an external celestial threat.\",\n      \"Kaelen witnessed the starfall and the subsequent fracturing of his Oath and the Spire.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_facts_ring\": [\n      \"Kaelen attempted to reinforce a failing iron ward-ring, resulting in a painful magical backlash.\",\n      \"The Star-glass of the West Gate was found to be 'feverish' and heavily fractured.\",\n      \"Kaelen's tuning fork was destroyed by the intense discordant energy of the Spire.\",\n      \"Kaelen realized the isolation of his post has become a deadly liability as the wards began to catastrophically fail.\",\n      \"Kaelen's magic is tied to a physical 'Starwrought Oath' that manifests as a thread in his wrist.\",\n      \"Magic use has a clear physical cost, including coldness, scorched lungs, and metallic scents.\",\n      \"The High Spire is isolated and the wards are failing at an accelerated, unnatural rate.\",\n      \"The stars are appearing 'heavy' and unstable in the sky.\",\n      \"Kaelen climbed to the upper gallery after finding the archives sealed by void-frost.\",\n      \"A star fell from the Spear-Bearer constellation, turning from white to a sickly violet.\",\n      \"The star impacted the Silver Valley, creating a crown of solidified glass and a rhythmic, alien heartbeat.\",\n      \"The shockwave caused the High Spire to tilt and shattered the star-glass pillars.\",\n      \"The Starwrought Oath in Kaelen's marrow buckled and fractured, losing its light.\",\n      \"Kaelen observed a shadow-shape emerging from the impact site before fleeing.\",\n      \"The Starwrought Oath is a physical pewter-colored thread woven into the marrow of the radius bone.\",\n      \"Magic use causes physical frost-burn and scorched lungs.\",\n      \"The starfall corruption is characterized by a bruised violet light and a rhythmic thrumming.\",\n      \"The High Spire is in a state of catastrophic collapse.\"\n    ],\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Kaelen witnessed the descent of a corrupted, violet star from the High Spire's upper gallery.\",\n      \"The impact liquified the valley floor and sent a metaphysical shockwave that fractured Kaelen's marrow-bound Oath.\",\n      \"The scene ended with Kaelen fleeing into the collapsing Spire as shadow-forms began to emerge from the crater.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"Kaelen's magic is tied to a physical 'Starwrought Oath' that manifests as a thread in his wrist.\",\n      \"Magic use has a clear physical cost, including coldness, scorched lungs, and metallic scents.\",\n      \"The High Spire is isolated and the wards are failing at an accelerated, unnatural rate.\",\n      \"The stars are appearing 'heavy' and unstable in the sky.\",\n      \"The Starwrought Oath is a physical pewter-colored thread woven into the marrow of the radius bone.\",\n      \"Magic use causes physical frost-burn and scorched lungs.\",\n      \"The starfall corruption is characterized by a bruised violet light and a rhythmic thrumming.\",\n      \"The High Spire is in a state of catastrophic collapse.\"\n    ],\n    \"story_so_far\": []\n  },\n  \"world\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_kaelen\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"High Spire - Upper Gallery and Interior\",\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_oath_binding\",\n      \"THREAD_starfall_corruption\"\n    ],\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"A corrupted star has impacted the Silver Valley, turning the earth into a crown of glass.\",\n      \"The Starwrought Oath in Kaelen's marrow has physically fractured and turned dark.\",\n      \"The High Spire is structurally failing and tilting after the impact shockwave.\",\n      \"Shadow-forms are emerging from the impact site in the valley.\",\n      \"Commander Varkas remains missing; the archives are sealed by void-frost.\"\n    ],\n    \"time\": {}\n  }\n}\n"
