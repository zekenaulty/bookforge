PROSE:
The shelf of vitrified silt was a cold, indifferent host. Kaelen lay where he had collapsed, his chest heaving in shallow, ragged bursts that tasted of scorched copper and the sharp, ozone-heavy scent of a lightning strike. Each inhalation was a penance. It wasn't just the altitude of the High Spire’s foothills that thinned the oxygen; it was the way the star-shard in his satchel seemed to consume the very atmosphere around it.

His right arm lay across his lap, a heavy, useless thing of waxy flesh and mottled purple bruising. The frost-burn, a brutal souvenir of the Oath’s fracture and the subsequent discharge at the crater’s floor, had turned the limb into a numbing anchor. The skin was translucent in the dying violet light of the valley, stretched tight over the radius bone where the Starwrought Oath resided. 

He could feel the pewter filament. It was no longer a smooth, supportive conduit within his marrow. The discharge had turned the metal brittle, and now, with every labored breath, he felt the sickening, microscopic grind of metal against bone—a dry clicking that vibrated up into his shoulder. The Oath was a physical splinter, a holy tether to a celestial order that was currently poisoning his blood.

A rhythmic sound pulsed from the leather satchel at his hip. 

Thump-hiss.

It was the heartbeat of a dying sun, a heavy, concussive vibration that hit the back of Kaelen’s teeth, followed by a sibilant leak of energy that made the fine hairs on his neck stand on end. The satchel jerked against his thigh. The shard was waking up, its alien resonance seeking a host to stabilize its own collapsing essence. If he didn't contain it, the pulse would grow until it shattered the container—and Kaelen’s remaining sanity along with it.

He reached out with his left hand, his fingers trembling. The movement was slow, deliberate. He unbuckled the strap. The thump-hiss grew louder, more insistent. A plume of pale violet vapor escaped the bag, smelling of old graves and cold iron.

Kaelen gritted his teeth, the metallic tang in his mouth intensifying until he felt he was sucking on a lead coin. He reached into the satchel and closed his hand around the shard.

The world vanished.

It wasn't just the agony of the vacuum pulling the warmth from his marrow. As his skin met the glass-like surface of the shard, Kaelen’s mind was forcibly expanded into the void. He saw it: a galaxy of guttering candles, stars winking out one by one into a suffocating, velvet dark. In the center of the collapse, a shape that was not a shape loomed—a cosmic beast with eyes like dying suns, its many-limbed shadow reaching across the firmament to pull the light from the sky. It was a predator of constellations, and it was looking back at him through the shard.

Kaelen’s lungs seized, the air in his windpipe turning to shards of ice. He couldn't scream; there was no breath left to carry the sound. He forced his eyes to stay open, fighting the vision of the beast, focusing instead on the physical bridge he had to build.

The pewter filament in his radius bone began to glow, not with the steady, silver light of the High Spire, but with a frantic, stuttering violet. The metal was reacting to the shard’s proximity, the two forces—the ancient Oath and the fallen star—grinding together like tectonic plates. Kaelen’s vision blurred, the edges of the world fraying into grey static. 

He focused on the center of his wrist, where the waxy skin was beginning to smoke. He had to bridge the gap. He had to offer the shard a path into the Oath. 

With a guttural, wordless grunt of effort, Kaelen pushed his remaining Oath-essence into the fractured metal. He visualized the filament not as a broken wire, but as a starving root. He commanded the pewter to reach out, to drink from the shard's necrotic pulse. 

The thump-hiss changed. The thump became a hammer blow against his soul, and the hiss became a roar in his ears. The violet light flared, blindingly bright, illuminating the veins in his arm like a map of a shattered kingdom. The pewter filament groaned—a physical sound, a metallic shriek muffled by muscle and skin. Kaelen felt the metal heat up, the friction of the binding melting the ice of the frost-burn from the inside out. 

It was a different kind of pain. The numbness was replaced by a searing, liquid fire that followed the line of the Oath from his wrist to his elbow. He watched, fascinated and horrified, as the waxy discoloration of his skin began to recede, replaced by a network of thin, black lines that traced the path of the new corruption. The shard wasn't being contained; it was being integrated.

The resonance began to slow. 

Thump... hiss.

Thump... hiss.

Kaelen’s own heart, laboring in his chest, began to stutter, trying to find the rhythm. His pulse skipped a beat, then another, caught in the gravity of the star-shard. For a terrifying moment, his chest was silent, the world falling into a profound, absolute stillness. 

Then, his heart kicked. 

Thump.

At the same microsecond, the shard in his hand pulsed. 

Thump.

The two rhythms merged. The hiss faded into a low, constant thrum that resided in the marrow of his radius bone, a vibration that made the pewter filament feel heavy and solid once more. The pain didn't vanish, but it shifted into a dull, manageable ache, a permanent weight that anchored him to the earth.

Kaelen slumped back against the obsidian rim, his hand still curled around the shard. The violet light had dimmed, retreating into the core of the stone. His right arm was no longer a useless weight; he could feel his fingers again, though they felt distant, as if he were wearing thick leather gloves. He flexed his hand. The black lines beneath the skin shifted with the movement, a permanent record of the bargain he had just struck.

The metallic scent of scorched copper was fading, replaced by the neutral, biting cold of the mountain night. He looked up, his gaze following the jagged silhouette of the valley walls to the horizon. 

There, perched like a broken crown atop the highest peak, was the High Spire. It was silhouetted against a sky that looked heavy, the stars themselves seeming to sag under an invisible weight. The Spire was tilting, a lean that spoke of foundational rot and the death of the old world. 

He had the shard. He had the map, even if he didn't yet know how to read it. But the Order was gone, and the Oath he carried was no longer the one he had sworn as a novice. It was something new, something starwrought and scarred.

Kaelen pushed himself to his feet. His legs were shaky, his lungs still felt as though they had been scrubbed with sand, but the synchronization held. With every beat of his heart, the shard hummed in his hand, a constant reminder of the ticking clock. 

He didn't look back at the crater. He didn't look at the glass valley where the shadow-forms waited for the sun to drop further. He turned his face toward the Spire and began the ascent. Every step was a struggle, a calculated shift of weight against the gravity of his new burden, but he moved with a grim, forward-motion that the old Kaelen, the one who had merely watched the wards, would not have recognized.

The silence of the Silver Valley was absolute, save for the rhythmic, metallic scrape of his boots and the steady, synchronized thrum of a heart that no longer belonged entirely to a man.
