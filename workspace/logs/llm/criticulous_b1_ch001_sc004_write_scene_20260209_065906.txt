PROSE:

The Lesser Forest Slime didn’t have a face, but it definitely had an attitude. It jiggled with a predatory rhythm, its translucent green mass pulsing like a neon stress ball filled with spite. 

[Lesser Forest Slime - Lvl 1] [HP: 10/10]

I backed up until the rough, gnarled bark of the ancient oak tree bit into my shoulder blades. My heart was doing a frantic drum solo against my ribs, a reminder that my current HP was exactly one. If a stray breeze carried too much pollen, I was pretty sure the System would consider it a lethal status effect.

"Okay, Artie. Think. It’s just physics and bad programming," I muttered, my fingers white-knuckled around the metal loop of my Keyring. My Honda Civic keys dangled like the world’s saddest flail. "I have a hundred percent crit rate. I just need to touch it. One tap, and the math does the rest."

The slime lunged. It didn’t crawl; it launched itself like a glob of radioactive snot.

I swung the keys with a desperate, uncoordinated yelp.

[Miss!]

The slime flattened itself against the grass, the metal teeth of my house keys whistling through the empty air where its "head" had been a microsecond before. I stumbled, my balance—or lack thereof—sending me teetering toward the very thing that wanted to dissolve my shins.

"Right. Agility of a sedentary potato. Noted," I wheezed, scrambling to reset my stance.

The creature recoiled, its gelatinous body shivering as it prepared for a second pass. It looked like it was laughing at me. I didn't blame it. I was a grown man in a business-casual button-down trying to fight a puddle with a grocery store loyalty card.

It hopped again. I swung low this time, aiming for the base.

[Miss!]

The slime performed a graceful, mid-air pirouette that would have made a gymnast weep. It sailed over my hand, landing with a wet *thwack* just inches from my left shoe. I jumped back, nearly tripping over a protruding root.

[Warning: HP 1/1. Any contact will result in immediate character deletion.]

"I know! I'm working on it!" I shouted at the floating red text. 

I tried a tactical thrust. It was a move I’d seen in a dozen movies, a sharp jab intended to puncture. 

[Miss!]

The slime didn't even move this time. It just... shifted. A hole opened up in the center of its mass, and my hand passed straight through the gap. The metal keys clattered against each other, ringing out in the quiet woods like a dinner bell for my own funeral. I yanked my arm back before the hole could close around my wrist.

"Three misses," I panted. "The RNG gods aren't even spitting on me. They’re just ignoring my existence."

The slime was getting bolder. It began to circle me, its green surface darkening. It was charging up. I could see the internal pressure building, the slime becoming more opaque as it prepared a high-velocity strike.

I lunged forward, trying to catch it off-balance.

[Miss!]

My foot slipped on a patch of damp moss. Instead of a heroic strike, I performed a rhythmic flail that ended with me hugging the ancient oak tree for dear life. The slime didn't even have to dodge; I’d missed by a solid three feet.

"This is it," I whispered, watching the slime coil itself into a tight, vibrating spring. "I’m going to be the first person in history to be killed by a Level 1 tutorial mob while having a literal cheat-code build."

The slime launched. It was a green blur, a projectile of pure aggression.

I didn't think. I didn't aim. I just closed my eyes and swung my right hand in a wide, panicked arc, the Keyring trailing behind like a comet of silver and plastic.

[Miss!]

The keys hit the air. The slime sailed past my ear. I felt the rush of wind, the cold sensation of death missing me by a fraction of an inch. That was five. Five misses. I was a statistical impossibility of failure.

But as I swung, my momentum carried me around. I was spinning, a human top of pure incompetence. My hand, still clutching the keys, slammed into the trunk of the ancient oak tree. 

Except, it didn't just hit the tree. 

The edge of my thumb—just a tiny sliver of skin—brushed against the trailing edge of the slime as it tried to recover from its leap.

The world turned white.

[SYSTEM ALERT: CRITICAL HIT!]
[CALCULATING DAMAGE...]
[ERROR: CRIT RATE 100% DETECTED]
[ERROR: NESTED MULTIPLIER DETECTED]
[ERROR: MATH.EXE HAS ENCOUNTERED A PROBLEM]
[SUPER-MEGA-ULTRA-CRIT!]

A sound like a thunderclap inside a library shattered the silence of the Whispering Woods. A pillar of pure, incandescent light erupted from the point of contact. It wasn't just a hit; it was a localized apocalypse. 

I felt a shockwave ripple through my arm, but it didn't hurt. It felt like... static. Like my entire body was being recalculated in real-time. 

When the light faded, the slime was gone. It wasn't dead; it was deleted. There wasn't even a stain on the grass. 

But it wasn't just the slime. 

The ancient oak tree—the massive, multi-ton landmark I had been cornered against—was gone. In its place was a perfectly circular, cauterized crater that extended twenty feet into the forest floor. The upper branches of the neighboring trees were smoldering, their leaves turned to ash by the sheer thermal output of a single, accidental punch.

I stood there, my hand still extended, clutching a Keyring that was now glowing with a faint, dying ember of blue light.

[System Notification]
[Target: Lesser Forest Slime (Lvl 1) - OBLITERATED]
[Damage Dealt: 9,999,999 (Overkill)]
[Experience Gained: 150 (Tutorial Bonus Applied)]

[LEVEL UP!]
[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon: Level 1 -> Level 2]

[Stat Points Awarded: 5]
[Current HP: 1/1 (Fixed)]

I stared at the crater. Then I looked at my keys. The plastic fob for my local gym had melted into a shapeless blob, but the keys themselves were fine. 

"Well," I said, my voice cracking. "At least I don't have to worry about the tree anymore."

I checked my status window. The '1/1' next to my HP was still there, mocking me in bright, neon red. Level 2 didn't change the fact that a stiff breeze could end my journey, but it did mean the System was officially tracking my carnage.

"Fizz?" I called out, looking around the smoking ruin of the tutorial zone. "I think I broke the woods."

There was no answer, just the sound of falling ash and the distant, confused chirping of birds that had somehow survived the math-based explosion. 

I looked down at my hand. My thumb was fine. Not a scratch. The 100% Crit Rate hadn't just made me powerful; it had turned me into a walking glitch. And if a Level 1 slime caused this much damage, I was terrified to see what would happen when I actually tried to hit something on purpose.

[Title Progress: Anomaly - 1%]

"Great," I muttered, wiping soot off my shirt. "I'm not a hero. I'm a bug report."
