SYSTEM:

# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Mechanics contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and labels (stats/skills) must be sourced from state or explicitly updated in the state_patch. Do not invent numbers or canonical tokens.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.


USER:

# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Check that any UI numbers or skill values in prose match state stats/skills. If not, emit a failure.
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The white void didn't have a floor, yet Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon was definitely standing on something. He looked down at his feet, which were no longer encased in the sensible loafers he’d worn to the office. Instead, they were wrapped in rough, itchy burlap. He looked at his right hand. The stapler he’d been carrying—part of a misguided attempt to defend his honor against the Snack-O-Matic 3000—had been replaced by a jagged hunk of rusted iron that vaguely resembled a sword.

"This is a lawsuit," Artie muttered, his voice echoing in the infinite nothingness. "This is a massive, multi-million dollar lawsuit. I had dental. I had a 401k. I had a bag of Zesty Ranch Habanero Hoops that was halfway out the dispenser."

"Actually, it was only three-quarters of the way out," a high-pitched, clinical voice corrected.

Artie spun around, nearly tripping over his own burlap-covered toes. A girl—or something that looked like a girl if girls were made of neon pixels and weaponized sarcasm—was hovering three feet off the non-existent ground. She wore a visor that glowed with scrolling green text and held a translucent Data Slate that hummed with power.

"I’m Fizz," she said, not looking up from her screen. "Your assigned System Liaison. And let me just say, Arthur, I’ve seen some pathetic exits, but 'Death by Vending Machine' is currently trending in the top five for this quarter. Very retro. Very sad."

"It was an electrical surge!" Artie protested, waving the Broken Tutorial Sword. The weight of it was awkward, pulling at his wrist. "The machine cheated me. I was just applying corrective force."

"You were shaking a three-hundred-pound metal box while standing in a puddle of spilled diet soda," Fizz said, finally looking at him. Her eyes were literal glowing asterisks. She tapped her Data Slate. "Let’s look at the official log, shall we?"

[System Log: Death Report]
[Subject: Penhaligon, Arthur]
[Cause of Death: Terminal Stupidity (Secondary: Electrocution)]
[Final Words: 'Give me my Hoops, you oversized toaster!']
[Status: Isekai-Eligible (Pity Tier)]

Artie felt a vein throb in his temple. "Pity tier? I was a Senior Logistics Analyst! I understand systems. I understand optimization. I was the king of the spreadsheet!"

"Great," Fizz said, flicking her wrist. A massive, shimmering blue screen materialized between them. It was covered in sliders, numbers, and icons that looked suspiciously like a character creation menu from the RPGs Artie used to play when he should have been analyzing logistics. "Then you won't mind optimizing your new life. You have 50 Attribute Points. Spend them wisely, or don't. Honestly, the sooner you die again, the sooner I get my lunch break."

Artie stepped closer to the screen. The Broken Tutorial Sword felt heavier by the second, so he tucked it under his arm for a moment to poke at the UI.

[Character Creation: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[Class: Unassigned]
[Level: 1]

[Attributes]
[Strength: 5] (+) (-)
[Agility: 5] (+) (-)
[Intelligence: 5] (+) (-)
[Vitality: 5] (+) (-)
[Luck: 5] (+) (-)

[Available Points: 50]

"Five in everything," Artie mused. "The baseline of mediocrity. Typical."

"It’s the 'Standard Human' package," Fizz said, yawning. She began to clean her visor with a corner of her glowing cape. "Most people put ten into Vitality so they don't get eaten by the first thing with teeth. But hey, you’re the 'king of the spreadsheet.' You do you."

Artie ignored her. He was scrolling through the sub-menus, looking for the hidden math. He found a tab labeled [Advanced Probability & Variance]. Inside was a single, golden slider: **Critical Hit Affinity.**

"What’s this?" Artie asked.

"Oh, that?" Fizz glanced over. "That’s the Luck multiplier. It governs how often the System rounds up in your favor. But it’s expensive. One point of Luck is worth five points of anything else. It’s a trap stat. Only idiots and gamblers touch it."

Artie’s eyes narrowed. "If I max this out, what happens to the math?"

"You get a 'Critical Hit' on every successful strike," Fizz said, her voice dripping with boredom. "But the System is a zero-sum engine, Arthur. To give you that kind of offensive variance, it has to pull from your stability. Your Vitality would bottom out. You’d be a glass cannon without the cannon part. More like a glass... pebble."

Artie looked at the slider. He looked at the Broken Tutorial Sword. He thought about the vending machine that had taken his life because he didn't have enough 'force' to get his snack. Never again. He wanted to be the surge, not the guy getting surged.

"Optimization," Artie whispered. "If I never get hit, I don't need health. And if every hit is a crit, I don't need Strength."

"Wait, what are you doing?" Fizz asked, her asterisks-eyes widening.

Artie grabbed the Critical Hit Affinity slider and slammed it to the far right. He didn't just spend the 50 points; he started draining the other stats to pay for the overflow. The UI began to flicker. Warning lights flashed red.

[WARNING: Stat Imbalance Detected]
[WARNING: Vitality dropping below Recommended Minimum]
[WARNING: Physical Integrity at Risk]

"Artie, stop! You’re going to break the avatar before it even spawns!" Fizz shouted, reaching for the screen.

Artie’s finger hit the [CONFIRM] button just as a massive surge of golden light erupted from the menu. The white void groaned, the sound of grinding gears echoing from the "Great Login Screen" itself.

[System Notification: Build Confirmed]
[New Title Acquired: Statistical Anomaly]
[New Title Acquired: The Glassest Cannon]

[Final Attributes]
[Strength: 1]
[Agility: 1]
[Intelligence: 1]
[Vitality: 1]
[Luck: 99]

[Calculated Combat Stats]
[HP: 1/1]
[MP: 1/1]
[Critical Hit Rate: 100%]
[Critical Hit Multiplier: 500%]

"One?" Fizz whispered, staring at the screen in genuine horror. "One hit point? Artie, a stiff breeze is a boss fight for you now. If you trip on a pebble, you’re dead. If you sneeze too hard, you’re dead. If a butterfly flaps its wings in the next kingdom over, you are statistically likely to explode!"

Artie felt... light. Dangerously light. He looked at his hands; they were slightly translucent around the edges. He gripped the Broken Tutorial Sword, and for the first time, he saw a faint, golden glow pulsing along the jagged edge.

"I won't trip," Artie said, though his knees felt a bit wobbly with a Strength stat of one. "And I won't sneeze. I’m going to crit this world until it gives me my change back."

"You’re an idiot," Fizz said, but she was already typing furiously on her Data Slate. "Fine. It’s your funeral. Again. Initiating deployment to Tutorial Zone: The Whispering Woods. Try not to die during the loading screen."

[System Notification: Deployment Commencing]
[Zone: Tutorial - Phase 1]
[Objective: Survive (Good Luck, You'll Need It)]

The white void began to dissolve into streaks of green and brown. Artie felt a sudden, violent pull at his navel. He clutched his broken sword in his right hand and the single copper coin in his pocket, bracing for a world where he was exactly one mistake away from 'TERMINATED.'

"See you on the other side, Fizz," Artie called out.

"I’ll bring a shovel!" she yelled back.
