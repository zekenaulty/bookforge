PROSE:

The vibration in the sky-glass anchor wasn't a sound; it was a fever that crawled up Kaelen’s arms and settled in the marrow of his collarbones. His palms, raw and weeping from the failed mending, stuck to the translucent surface of the crystal. Every jagged edge of the internal fractures felt like a razor’s edge pressed against his mind. The ward-light was dying, flickering in rhythmic gasps that matched the shallow thud of his own heart. 

He pulled his hands away, the skin tearing slightly where the glass had begun to fuse with his sweat and blood. The scent of scorched copper was thick here, a metallic shroud that stifled the thin mountain air. Below the High Spire, the valley should have been a carpet of nocturnal life—the distant lowing of livestock, the flicker of hearth-fires in the foothills, the rustle of the pines. Instead, it was a bowl of absolute, terrifying silence. The void-influence had swallowed the sound days ago, but now, even the shadows seemed to be holding their breath.

A pinprick of violet tore through the upper atmosphere.

It didn't streak like a falling stone. It didn't burn with the orange-white friction of the heavens. It descended with a predatory deliberation, a jagged tear of bruised light that bled across the sky. As it dropped, the sky-glass anchor behind Kaelen began to scream. The sound was a high-frequency whine that shattered the stillness, a mourning cry of ancient lattice-work recognizing its executioner. 

Kaelen leaned against the stone parapet, his legs trembling. The Starwrought Oath hummed in his blood, a cold, tethered weight that pulled toward the falling light. The cost of the failed mending was a hollow ache in his chest, a sensation of being emptied of heat. He watched the violet star grow, expanding from a spark into a Great Eye of malevolent radiance. It cast long, distorted shadows across the Spire’s masonry—shadows that didn't point away from the light, but seemed to reach toward it, hungry and desperate.

The light turned the valley into a landscape of bruised velvet. The trees were silhouettes of charcoal against a sky that had forgotten the stars. Kaelen’s vision blurred, the violet glare searing into his retinas. He should have been down there. He should have been sounding the bells, rallying the weavers, doing anything other than standing atop a crumbling relic watching the end of the world arrive in silence. But the Oath held him here, bound to the failing anchor, a captain tethered to a sinking mast.

The star didn't hit the ground so much as it erased it. 

When it touched the valley floor, there was no immediate explosion of fire. There was only a flash of negative space, a sphere of violet-black that expanded with sickening speed. For three heartbeats, the world was perfectly, unnaturally still. Kaelen saw the shockwave before he felt it—a ripple in the air that distorted the horizon, turning the solid earth into a liquid wave of dust and uprooted forest.

Then the sound arrived.

It wasn't a boom. It was a tectonic grind, the sound of the world’s spine snapping under an impossible weight. The High Spire groaned, the ancient stones shifting with a dry, rasping protest. The sky-glass anchor behind Kaelen didn't just fracture further; it erupted. Shards of crystal, energized by the impact’s resonance, hissed through the air like shrapnel. 

Kaelen threw himself to the floor, his face pressed against the cold, vibrating stone. The shockwave hit the Spire with the force of a physical blow. The entire structure leaned, the foundations screaming as they fought to remain anchored to the peak. Dust choked him, tasting of old lime and the bitter, acidic tang of the starfall. 

He gripped the edge of a floor-tile, his fingernails cracking against the stone. The roar went on and on, a continuous, deafening howl that stripped away thought and replaced it with a primal, suffocating dread. Through the gaps in the parapet, he saw the valley floor glowing with a low, pulsing amethyst light, the impact site a wound in the earth that refused to close. 

The silence that followed was worse than the noise. It was a heavy, pressurized quiet that made his ears bleed. Kaelen pushed himself up, his muscles screaming in protest. His hands were shaking so violently he had to tuck them into his sleeves. The sky-glass anchor was a ruin of jagged stumps, its light completely extinguished. 

The sun was still hours away, but the valley was no longer dark. It was bathed in the sickly, rhythmic throb of the fallen star, a beacon for whatever was coming next. Kaelen looked at his hands, seeing the faint, violet luminescence beginning to trace the veins beneath his skin. The Oath wasn't just humming anymore; it was singing, a discordant melody that promised he would not be allowed to die until the debt was paid in full.
