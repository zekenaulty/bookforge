Arthur Penhaligon stared at the bag, his reflection in the vending machine\u2019s scratched plexiglass looking back with the hollowed-out eyes of a man who had spent eight hours auditing spreadsheets for a company that sold industrial-grade adhesives.\n\n[Patience: 5/100]\n\n\"You\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\" Artie muttered. His voice sounded thin in the empty breakroom, competing with the low-frequency hum of a refrigerator that had been dying since the late nineties. \n\nHe looked down at the Smartphone in his right hand. The screen flickered to life: 4:58 PM. Two minutes. He had two minutes left on the clock before he could legally flee this fluorescent purgatory, and the only thing standing between him and a dignified commute was a seventy-five-cent bag of corn-based disappointment. \n\nArtie tapped his thumb against the glass of the phone. His current build\u2014if one could call a thirty-two-year-old accountant a 'build'\u2014was heavily specced into [Cynicism] and [Procrastination]. It wasn't a winning meta.\n\n[Skill Check: Cynicism (Level 3) \u2013 Success!]\n[Observation: The vending machine isn't broken; it's malicious. It knows you\u2019re at your breaking point. It feeds on the tears of the underpaid.]\n\n\"I know,\" he whispered to the empty room. \"I know.\"\n\nHe tightened his grip on the Smartphone. It was his only connection to a world that didn't smell like burnt coffee and despair. He reached into his left pocket with his free hand, fingers brushing against the cool, cracked surface of his Leather Wallet. He didn't need more money; he\u2019d already paid. The machine\u2019s digital display was mocking him with a steady, unblinking '0.00'.\n\nArtie leaned his forehead against the cool plexiglass. \"Listen, you oversized toaster. I\u2019ve had a day. Brenda from HR asked me to 'circle back' on a memo six times. My car is making a sound like a cat in a blender. Just give me the Zings.\"\n\nThe machine didn't respond. It just hummed, a steady, vibrating drone that Artie felt in his teeth. \n\n[Patience: 2/100]\n\nThis was the boss fight of his mundane existence. The Breakroom Golem. Its armor was made of reinforced steel and bad luck. Its loot table was exclusively snacks that expired during the previous administration. And right now, it was winning.\n\nArtie shifted his weight, the Keyring in his right pocket jingling as he prepared for a tactical maneuver. In the world of corporate survival, this was known as 'Percussive Maintenance.' To anyone else, it was just kicking the crap out of a machine.\n\nHe checked his stats. \n\n[HP: 100/100]\n[Status: Disgruntled Employee]\n\nHe was at full health, but his mental resources were tapped. Artie took a deep breath, ensured the Smartphone was secure in his right hand, and delivered a measured, frustrated kick to the base of the machine.\n\n*Thud.*\n\nThe bag of Zings didn't even quiver. If anything, it seemed to settle deeper into the coil, nestling in for a long winter\u2019s nap.\n\n\"Oh, so that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be?\" Artie snarled. \n\n[Patience: 0/100]\n\nHe grabbed the sides of the machine. It was heavy, weighted down by the collective misery of the accounting department. He began to shake it. The hum from the machine changed pitch\u2014a rising, angry whine that sounded less like a cooling fan and more like a jet engine preparing for takeoff.\n\n\"Give! Me! My! Chips!\"\n\nHe gave it one final, desperate heave. \n\nInside the machine, something snapped. Not the plastic coil\u2014that stayed perfectly still. No, the sound came from the back, a sharp, electric crack that echoed like a gunshot in the small room. A blue arc of light danced behind the rows of chocolate bars, illuminating the interior with a hellish, flickering glow.\n\n[Warning: Environmental Hazard Detected!]\n[System Note: Maybe stop touching the high-voltage equipment, Artie?]\n\n\"I don't care about the hazard! I want my\u2014\"\n\nThe machine didn't just short-circuit. It exhaled. \n\nA surge of raw, unbridled electricity surged through the metal frame, jumping the gap between the chassis and Artie's sweat-slicked palms. The world didn't go black immediately. First, it went white. A blinding, searing neon white that turned his skeleton into a silhouette.\n\n[Critical Hit! -100 HP]\n\nThe pain was brief, mostly because his nerves didn't have time to process the fact that they were being cooked. He felt a strange sensation of weightlessness, followed by the distinct sound of his Smartphone hitting the linoleum floor with a pathetic clack. \n\nHis Leather Wallet felt heavy in his pocket for one last second before the sensation of 'having a body' became a legacy feature he no longer supported.\n\n[HP: 0/100]\n[Status: Deceased]\n\n\"Well,\" Artie thought, the last spark of his consciousness flickering like a dying lightbulb. \"At least I don't have to circle back with Brenda.\"\n\nThe breakroom faded. The smell of ozone and Zesty Ranch Zings vanished. The floor, the ceiling, and the crushing weight of his thirty-year mortgage dissolved into a vast, shimmering void of darkness. \n\nHe wasn't standing. He wasn't sitting. He just was. \n\nAnd then, a window appeared. Not a window made of glass, but a floating, translucent box of light that pulsed with a soft, rhythmic glow.\n\n[Welcome to the Character Creation Suite!]\n[Error: Unexpected Termination Detected.]\n[Recalculating...

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nItem naming: use display_name for prose; use item_id only in JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nIf mechanics are shown in prose or UI, they must be present in continuity system state or added in continuity system updates in the same STATE_PATCH.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches.

must_stay_true>\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n- All *_updates arrays must contain objects; never emit bare strings as array entries.\n- character_updates.containers must be an array of objects with at least: container, owner, contents (array).\n- Durable-state mutation blocks are mandatory when applicable:\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects; never an object with an `updates` field.\n- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.\n- If you mutate durable state, do not leave the same mutation only in prose.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n  - Each entry must include character_id, chapter, scene, inventory (full current list), containers (full current list), invariants_add (array), persona_updates (array).\n  - character_updates.inventory MUST be an array of objects, never string item ids.\n  - Inventory object shape: {\"item\": \"ITEM_or_name\", \"container\": \"hand_left|hand_right|<container>\", \"status\": \"held|carried|equipped|stowed\"}.\n  - Container object shape: {\"container\": \"<name>\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_id\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_id\", \"...\"]}.\n  - If you have a single persona update, still wrap it in an array of strings.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger and invariants using standard phrasing, e.g.:\n  - Avoid numeric mechanics in must_stay_true; store them in continuity system updates instead.\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> shard (carried, container=satchel)\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> longsword (carried, container=hand_right)\n  - container: satchel (owner=CHAR_example, contents=[shard, maps])\n  - milestone: shard_bind = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - milestone: maps_acquired = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - injury: right forearm scar / left arm filament\n  - ownership: shard (carried) / shard (bound but physical)\n\nIssues:\n[\n  {\n    \"code\": \"pov_drift\",\n    \"message\": \"Scene

millimeters short of a successful delivery. I stared at the bag, my reflection in the vending machine\u2019s scratched plexiglass looking back with the hollowed-out eyes of a man who had spent eight hours auditing spreadsheets for a company that sold industrial-grade adhesives.\n\n[Patience: 4/100]\n\n\"You\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\" I muttered. My voice sounded thin in the empty breakroom, competing with the low-frequency hum of a refrigerator that had been dying since the late nineties. \n\nI looked down at the Smartphone in my right hand. The screen flickered to life: 4:58 PM. Two minutes. I had two minutes left on the clock before I could legally flee this fluorescent purgatory, and the only thing standing between me and a dignified commute was a seventy-five-cent bag of corn-based disappointment. \n\nI tapped my thumb against the glass of the phone. My current build\u2014if you could call a thirty-two-year-old accountant a 'build'\u2014was heavily specced into [Cynicism] and [Procrastination]. It wasn't a winning meta.\n\n[Skill Check: Cynicism (Level 3) \u2013 Success!]\n[Observation: The vending machine isn't broken; it's malicious. It knows you\u2019re at your breaking point. It feeds on the tears of the underpaid.]\n\n\"I know,\" I whispered to the empty room. \"I know.\"\n\nI shoved the Smartphone into my pocket for a second to free up my hand, then changed my mind and kept it gripped tight. It was my only connection to a world that didn't smell like burnt coffee and despair. I reached into my left pocket, fingers brushing against the cool, cracked surface of my Leather Wallet. I didn't need more money; I\u2019d already paid. The machine\u2019s digital display was mocking me with a steady, unblinking '0.00'.\n\nI leaned my forehead against the cool plexiglass. \"Listen, you oversized toaster. I\u2019ve had a day. Brenda from HR asked me to 'circle back' on a memo six times. My car is making a sound like a cat in a blender. Just give me the Zings.\"\n\nThe machine didn't respond. It just hummed, a steady, vibrating drone that I felt in my teeth. \n\n[Patience: 2/100]\n\nThis was the boss fight of my mundane existence. The Breakroom Golem. Its armor was made of reinforced steel and bad luck. Its loot table was exclusively snacks that expired during the Obama administration. And right now, it was winning.\n\nI shifted my weight, the Keyring in my right pocket jingling as I prepared for a tactical maneuver. In the world of corporate survival, this was known as 'Percussive Maintenance.' To anyone else, it was just kicking the crap out of a machine.\n\nI checked my stats. \n\n[HP: 100/100]\n[Status: Disgruntled]\n\nI was at full health, but my mental resources were tapped. I took a deep breath, shifted my Smartphone to a more secure grip in my right hand, and delivered a measured, frustrated kick to the base of the machine.\n\n*Thud.*\n\nThe bag of Zings didn't even quiver. If anything, it seemed to settle deeper into the coil, nestling in for a long winter\u2019s nap.\n\n\"Oh, so that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be?\" I snarled. \n\n[Patience: 1/100]\n\nI grabbed the sides of the machine. It was heavy, bolted to the floor or just weighted down by the collective misery of the accounting department. I began to shake it. The hum from the machine changed pitch\u2014a rising, angry whine that sounded less like a cooling fan and more like a jet engine preparing for takeoff.\n\n\"Give! Me! My! Chips!\"\n\nI gave it one final, desperate heave. \n\nInside the machine, something snapped. Not the plastic coil\u2014that stayed perfectly still. No, the sound came from the back, a sharp, electric *crack* that echoed like a gunshot in the small room. A blue arc of light danced behind the rows of chocolate bars, illuminating the interior with a hellish, flickering glow.\n\n[Warning: Environmental Hazard Detected!]\n[System Note: Maybe stop touching the high-voltage equipment, Artie?]\n\n\"I don't care about the hazard! I want my\u2014\"\n\nThe machine didn't just short-circuit. It exhaled. \n\nA surge of raw, unbridled electricity surged through the metal frame, jumping the gap between the chassis and my sweat-slicked palms. The world didn't go black immediately. First, it went white. A blinding, searing neon white that turned my skeleton into a silhouette.\n\n[Critical Hit! -100 HP]\n\nThe pain was brief, mostly because my nerves didn't have time to process the fact that they were being cooked medium-well. I felt a strange sensation of weightlessness, followed by the distinct sound of my Smartphone hitting the linoleum floor with a pathetic *clack*. \n\nMy Leather Wallet felt heavy in my pocket for one last second before the sensation of 'having a body' became a legacy feature I no longer supported.\n\n[HP: 0/100]\n[Status: Deceased]\n\n\"Well,\" I thought, the last spark of my consciousness flickering like a dying lightbulb. \"At least I don't have to circle back with Brenda.\"\n\nThe breakroom faded. The smell of ozone and Zesty Ranch Zings vanished. The floor, the ceiling, and the crushing weight of my thirty-year mortgage dissolved into a vast, shimmering void of darkness. \n\nI wasn't standing. I wasn't sitting. I just *was*. \n\nAnd then, a window appeared. Not a window made of glass, but a floating, translucent box of light that pulsed with a soft, rhythmic glow.\n\n[Welcome to the Character Creation Suite!]\n[Error: Unexpected Termination Detected.]\n[Recalculating...
