  "text": "COMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: SC_001_003\nAllowed events: Artie noticing 1/1 HP, Fizz providing snarky commentary, description of Whispering Woods as mechanically hostile, slime encounter escalation, Artie cornered.\nForbidden milestones: artie_died (DONE), system_login (DONE), build_confirmed (DONE), first_spawn (DONE), slime_encounter_start (DONE).\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Broken Tutorial Sword (carried, container=hand_right), inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Linen Tunic (equipped, container=body), inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Single Copper Coin (stowed, container=pockets).\n\nPROSE:\nThe moss beneath Artie\u2019s boots felt like recycled polyester, a synthetic crunch echoing through the neon-tinged silence of the Whispering Woods. Above, the canopy didn't just rustle; it hissed with the sound of thousands of overlapping voices reciting patch notes in a low, digital monotone. *...fixed a bug where squirrels could phase through reality... increased drop rate for low-quality acorns... optimized shadow rendering for predatory bushes...*\n\nArtie stood frozen, his fingers white-knuckled around the hilt of the Broken Tutorial Sword already gripped in his right hand. The jagged piece of rusted iron felt heavier than it had any right to be, a physical manifestation of his 1 Strength stat. He didn't dare move, not after his last tentative step had triggered a flickering [System Notification: Stealth Check Failed!] that mocked his lack of Agility.\n\nIn the upper-left corner of his vision, the translucent red bar was a constant, terrifying reminder of his choices. It was so thin it looked like a stray hair caught on his cornea, a fragile thread of existence that the System deemed sufficient for a 'Statistical Anomaly'.\n\n[HP: 1 / 1]\n[MP: 1 / 1]\n\n\"One,\" Artie whispered, his voice barely audible over the mechanical hissing of the leaves. \"It\u2019s really just one.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s a very sturdy one,\" Fizz said, hovering a few feet away. She was tapping away at her Data Slate, the blue light of the screen reflecting off her wings in sharp, jagged patterns. \"Technically, it's a whole number. It\u2019s significantly better than zero. Although, in this zone, the difference between one and zero is usually about three kilograms of force or a particularly aggressive sneeze.\"\n\nShe looked up from her slate, her eyes tracking the Level 1 Slime that was currently vibrating in the center of the clearing. The creature was a translucent, lime-green mass of semi-solid sludge, about the size of a beach ball. Inside its gelatinous body, Artie could see the half-dissolved remains of a tutorial handbook and what looked like a very surprised-looking crow. Two black, bead-like eyes drifted lazily within the goo, eventually settling on Artie with a mindless, predatory focus.\n\n[Tutorial Slime - Lvl 1]\n[HP: 10/10]\n[Status: Aggressive]\n\n\"Right,\" Artie said, trying to find a center he wasn't sure he possessed. \"One hundred percent crit rate. That\u2019s the plan. I just need to hit it before it hits me.\"\n\n\"A bold strategy, Cotton,\" Fizz muttered, her wings buzzing with a sound like a cooling fan. \"Just a friendly reminder: that slime\u2019s 'Passive Ooze' aura deals 0.1 damage per second to anything within a one-meter radius. Since the System rounds up for damage calculations...\"\n\nArtie\u2019s eyes widened, his gaze darting from the slime to the invisible boundary Fizz was describing. \"Wait, what? Rounds up? You mean 0.1 becomes...?\"\n\n\"One,\" Fizz confirmed with a grin that was entirely too cheerful for the situation. \"Math is a cruel mistress, Artie. If it touches you, you\u2019re dead. If you stand too close for too long, you\u2019re dead. If it spits on you, you\u2019re dead. Honestly, if it just looks at you with enough intensity, I might have to start looking for a new assignment. I hear the 'Infinite Mana' builds are much more relaxing to guide.\"\n\nThe slime lunged. \n\nIt wasn't a fast movement, but it was relentless. It gathered its mass, the green sludge rippling with a sound like a giant heart beating inside a bucket of mayonnaise, and threw itself forward in a wet, heavy flop. Artie scrambled backward, his heel catching on a gnarled root that looked like a charred circuit board. He flailed, his arms windmilling as he barely kept his balance, the rusted sword nearly slipping from his sweat-slicked palm.\n\nThe slime landed exactly where he had been standing a second ago, the ground sizzling slightly where the ooze touched the moss. A small cloud of digital ozone rose from the impact site.\n\n\"Missed!\" Artie shouted, his voice an octave higher than usual.\n\n\"By about three inches,\" Fizz noted, checking her slate again. \"Your heart rate is currently 140 BPM. If it hits 160, I think your 1 HP might just give up out of sheer stress. The System has a very low tolerance for 'Emotional Damage' when your Vitality is this low.\"\n\nArtie didn't respond. He was too busy watching the slime re-orient itself. The creature didn't have a front or a back, just a shifting mass of hunger that was already turning toward him again. The Whispering Woods seemed to lean in, the shadows of the trees jittering a fraction of a second after the branches did, as if the world\u2019s rendering engine was struggling to keep up with his precarious existence.\n\nTo his left, a thicket of thorns hummed with static electricity, the needles glowing with a faint, dangerous purple light. To his right, the ground fell away into a steep ravine filled with a thick, lavender fog that smelled of burnt copper. He was being hemmed in, the gnarled roots of a 'Patch-Note Oak' rising up behind him like a wall of jagged iron.\n\nThe slime wobbled again, its entire body pulsing with a sickly light. It was faster this time. It didn't just flop; it launched itself, a glob of green slime detaching from its main body like a projectile. \n\nArtie ducked, the glob whistling over his head with a sound like a wet whip. It slammed into the Patch-Note Oak behind him, the bark hissing and beginning to melt. The 'Whispering' of the tree turned into a distorted, high-pitched scream of ERROR: CORRUPT TEXTURE DATA before the sound cut out into static.\n\n\"It has a ranged attack?\" Artie yelled, scrambling to his feet and nearly tripping over his own Linen Tunic, which felt as thin and useless as a hospital gown.\n\n\"It\u2019s a slime, Artie. They\u2019re 90% projectile,\" Fizz said. She was now hovering upside down, looking bored. \"Honestly, the fact that you\u2019re still alive is a statistical anomaly in itself. The System is probably already trying to figure out which sub-routine it needs to run to fix you. You\u2019re like a divide-by-zero error in a pair of boots.\"\n\nArtie backed away, his shoulders hitting the cold, metallic bark of the tree. The slime was moving with a strange, predatory intelligence now, its gelatinous body stretching out to cover more ground, cutting off his only clear path back toward the center of the clearing. \n\n[Warning: Enemy is charging a Heavy Attack!]\n[Probability of Survival: 0.0001%]\n\nThe notification flashed in bright, neon yellow, obscuring his vision for a split second. \n\n\"Shut up,\" Artie hissed at the air. \n\nThe slime distended, its green body growing thin and taut like a rubber band being pulled to its breaking point. The two black eyes stared at Artie, reflecting his own terrified face. The air in the woods felt heavy, the whispers of the trees reaching a fever pitch as they anticipated the 'Deletion' event. \n\nArtie gripped the Broken Tutorial Sword with both hands now, though the System still registered it as being in his right. He needed to time this. One hit. That was all it would take. With his 100% Crit Rate, even a 1 Strength swing should be enough to vaporize a Level 1 mob, provided the math held up.\n\n\"Come on,\" Artie breathed, the world slowing down as the slime launched itself. \n\nIt was a wall of green death, a solid mass of corrosive sludge flying through the air with the weight of a bowling ball. Artie had nowhere to go. He was cornered, the jagged roots pinning him in place, the smell of rot and acid filling his nostrils. The heat of the creature\u2019s 'Passive Ooze' began to prickle against his skin, a warning that the 0.1 damage was only milliseconds away.\n\nArtie swung. He didn't swing with strength\u2014he didn't have any. He swung with the desperation of a man who had already died once and really didn't want to make a habit of it.\n\nThe broken blade cut through the air, trailing a faint, golden light\u2014the signature of a guaranteed Critical Hit.\n\nBut the slime was already mid-air, its mass shifting, its trajectory aimed directly at Artie\u2019s chest. The collision was inevitable, a mathematical certainty that Artie\u2019s 1 HP was about to be tested against the full weight of a Level 1 tutorial boss.\n\n\"Artie!\" Fizz shouted, her snark finally replaced by genuine alarm as the green mass obscured her view of her charge.\n\nThe sword connected with the outer membrane of the slime, the golden light flaring bright enough to drown out the neon green of the woods. But the momentum of the creature didn't stop, and Artie felt the first touch of the cold, acidic sludge against his Linen Tunic.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present_ids\": [\"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"CHAR_FIZZ\"],\n    \"location\": \"The Whispering Woods\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie is facing a Level 1 Slime in the Whispering Woods.\",\n      \"Artie realized that 0.1 damage rounds up to 1, making his 1 HP build extremely lethal.\",\n      \"The Whispering Woods are filled with mechanical hazards and patch-note whispers.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"]\n  },\n  \"character_stat_updates\": {\n    \"CHAR_ARTIE\": {\n      \"hp\": 1,\n      \"hp_max\": 1,\n      \"mp\": 1,\n      \"mp_max\": 1,\n      \"luck\": 99,\n      \"crit_rate\": 100\n    }\n  },\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 3,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\"container\": \"hand_right\", \"item\": \"Broken Tutorial Sword\", \"status\": \"carried\"},\n        {\"container\": \"body\", \"item\": \"Linen Tunic\", \"status\": \"equipped\"},\n        {\"container\": \"pockets\", \"item\": \"Single Copper Coin\", \"status\": \"stowed\"}\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\"container\": \"hand_right\", \"contents\": [\"Broken Tutorial Sword\"], \"location\": \"arm_right\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\"},\n        {\"container\": \"pockets\", \"contents\": [\"Single Copper Coin\"], \"location\": \"legs\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\"}\n      ],\n      \"invariants_add\": [\n        \"location: The Whispering Woods\",\n        \"milestone: first_spawn = DONE\",\n        \"milestone: slime_encounter_start = DONE\"\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie is hyper-aware of his 1 HP fragility.\",\n        \"Artie is learning to read the environment for tactical advantages.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie met his System Liaison, Fizz, in the white void and reviewed his embarrassing death report involving a vending machine.\",\n      \"Despite Fizz's warnings about the 'trap stat', Artie drained his physical and mental attributes to the minimum to maximize his Luck.\",\n      \"This resulted in a 'Statistical Anomaly' build with 1 HP and a guaranteed 100% Critical Hit rate.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Artie realized his 1 HP build means any damage, even rounded-up decimals, is lethal.\",\n      \"The Whispering Woods environment was revealed to be mechanically hostile and filled with patch-note whispers.\",\n      \"Artie was cornered by a Level 1 Slime and forced to attempt a desperate Critical Hit.\",\n      \"The slime launched a heavy attack, leading to an inevitable collision.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"milestone: artie_died = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: system_login = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: build_confirmed = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: first_spawn = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: slime_encounter_start = DONE\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Broken Tutorial Sword (carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"location: The Whispering Woods\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Artie has entered the tutorial zone with a 1 HP build and is immediately fighting for survival.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nMechanics contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and labels (stats/skills) must be sourced from state or explicitly updated in the state_patch. Do not invent numbers or canonical tokens.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.'

to the Whispering Woods didn't feel like a magical teleportation. It felt like being shoved through a keyhole by a very large, very impatient foot. Artie hit the ground with a thud that vibrated through his teeth, the smell of damp pine and digitized ozone filling his lungs.\n\nHe didn't move for a second. He just lay there, face-down in moss that felt suspiciously like recycled polyester.\n\n\"Welcome to the world of *Crit-iculous*,\" Fizz\u2019s voice drifted down, dripping with a level of sarcasm that could probably erode granite. \"Try not to die in the first thirty seconds. It makes the paperwork a nightmare, and I\u2019ve already reached my quota for 'idiots who fell off the spawn platform' this fiscal quarter.\"\n\nArtie groaned, pushing himself up. As he did, a translucent red bar flickered into existence in the upper-left corner of his vision. It was so thin it looked like a stray hair caught on his cornea. \n\n[HP: 1 / 1]\n[MP: 1 / 1]\n\n\"One,\" Artie whispered, his voice cracking. \"It\u2019s really just one.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s a very sturdy one,\" Fizz said, hovering a few feet away. She was tapping away at her Data Slate, the blue light of the screen reflecting off her wings. \"Technically, it's a whole number. It\u2019s significantly better than zero. Although, in this zone, the difference between one and zero is usually about three kilograms of force or a particularly aggressive sneeze.\"\n\nArtie stood up, dusting off his Linen Tunic. He felt light. Too light. His Strength was at the absolute minimum the System allowed without him collapsing into a puddle of sentient meat. He reached down and gripped the hilt of the Broken Tutorial Sword strapped to his hip, drawing it with a metallic *shink* that sounded far more heroic than the weapon looked. It was a jagged piece of rusted iron that looked like it had been used to pry open crates for a decade before being handed to him.\n\n\"Right,\" Artie said, trying to find his center. \"One hundred percent crit rate. That\u2019s the plan. I just need to hit them before they hit me.\"\n\n\"A bold strategy, Cotton,\" Fizz muttered, not looking up from her slate. \"Let\u2019s see how it plays out against the local wildlife.\"\n\nThe Whispering Woods lived up to its name, but not in the way the travel brochures probably described. The wind didn't rustle the leaves; it hissed through them in a way that sounded like thousands of overlapping voices reciting patch notes. *...fixed a bug where squirrels could phase through reality... increased drop rate for low-quality acorns... optimized shadow rendering for predatory bushes...*\n\nThe trees themselves were massive, gnarled things with bark that looked like charred circuit boards. The light filtering through the canopy was a sickly, neon-tinged green, casting long, jittery shadows that seemed to move a fraction of a second after the branches did. It was a beautiful place, if you liked your nature with a side of existential dread and a high probability of mechanical failure.\n\nArtie took a step forward, his boots crunching on a fallen branch.\n\n[System Notification: Stealth Check Failed!]\n[Reason: You have the grace of a caffeinated toddler in a room full of bubble wrap.]\n\n\"Oh, that\u2019s helpful,\" Artie snapped. \"Thanks, System.\"\n\n\"Don't blame the System for your lack of Agility,\" Fizz said, floating alongside him. \"You\u2019re the one who decided that 'moving quietly' was a luxury you couldn't afford. You\u2019re basically a walking dinner bell for anything with ears. Or vibrations. Or a general sense of hunger.\"\n\nA low, wet sound echoed from behind a cluster of glowing ferns. It was a rhythmic, pulsing noise, like a giant heart beating inside a bucket of mayonnaise. Artie froze, his hand tightening on the hilt of his broken sword.\n\n\"Is that...?\"\n\n\"That,\" Fizz said, finally stowing her Data Slate and crossing her arms, \"is your first lesson in humility. Or your last lesson in existence. It\u2019s a toss-up, really.\"\n\nThe ferns parted, and a Level 1 Slime wobbled into the clearing. \n\nIt wasn't the cute, bouncy mascot from a classic JRPG. It was a translucent, lime-green mass of semi-solid sludge, about the size of a beach ball and twice as heavy. Inside its gelatinous body, Artie could see the half-dissolved remains of a tutorial handbook and what looked like a very surprised-looking crow. Two black, bead-like eyes drifted lazily within the goo, eventually settling on Artie.\n\n[Tutorial Slime - Lvl 1]\n[HP: 10/10]\n[Status: Aggressive]\n\nThe slime didn't roar. It just... vibrated. The sound was a low-frequency hum that made Artie\u2019s 1 HP feel even more precarious. \n\n\"Okay,\" Artie said, his heart hammering against his ribs. \"It\u2019s Level 1. I can do this. I have a sword. I have the crits.\"\n\n\"You also have the durability of a wet paper towel in a hurricane,\" Fizz reminded him. \"Just a friendly reminder: that slime\u2019s 'Passive Ooze' aura deals 0.1 damage per second to anything within a one-meter radius. Since the System rounds up for damage calculations...\"\n\nArtie\u2019s eyes widened. \"Wait, what?\"\n\n\"Math is a cruel mistress, Artie,\" Fizz said with a grin. \"If it touches you, you\u2019re dead. If you stand too close for too long, you\u2019re dead. If it spits on you, you\u2019re dead. Honestly, if it just looks at you with enough intensity, I might have to start looking for a new assignment.\"\n\nThe slime lunged. \n\nIt wasn't a fast movement, but it was relentless. It gathered its mass and threw itself forward in a wet, heavy flop. Artie scrambled backward, his heel catching on a root. He flailed, his arms windmilling as he barely kept his balance. The slime landed exactly where he had been standing a second ago, the ground sizzling slightly where the ooze touched the moss.\n\n\"Missed!\" Artie shouted, his voice an octave higher than usual.\n\n\"By about three inches,\" Fizz noted. \"Your heart rate is currently 140 BPM. If it hits 160, I think your 1 HP might just give up out of sheer stress.\"\n\nArtie didn't respond. He was too busy watching the slime. It was already re-orienting itself, the green sludge rippling as it prepared for another lunge. Artie held the broken sword out in front of him, his hands shaking. He needed to time this. One hit. That was all it would take. With his 100% Crit Rate, even a 1 Strength punch with a broken sword should be enough to vaporize a Level 1 mob.\n\nBut he had to get close.\n\nAnd getting close meant entering the 'Passive Ooze' zone.\n\n\"Fizz, how far is a meter?\" Artie asked, his eyes locked on the slime\u2019s bead-like eyes.\n\n\"About three of your very shaky steps,\" she replied. \"Or one very confident lunge. Which, given your current state, I wouldn't recommend.\"\n\nThe slime wobbled again, its entire body pulsing with a sickly light. It was faster this time. It didn't just flop; it launched itself, a glob of green slime detaching from its main body like a projectile. \n\nArtie ducked, the glob whistling over his head and slamming into a tree behind him. The bark hissed and began to melt, the 'Whispering' of the tree turning into a distorted, high-pitched scream of *ERROR: CORRUPT TEXTURE DATA*.\n\n\"It has a ranged attack?\" Artie yelled, scrambling to his feet.\n\n\"It\u2019s a slime, Artie. They\u2019re 90% projectile,\" Fizz said. She was now hovering upside down, looking bored. \"Honestly, the fact that you\u2019re still alive is a statistical anomaly in itself. The System is probably already trying to figure out which sub-routine it needs to run to fix you.\"\n\nArtie backed away, but he was running out of clearing. Behind him, the gnarled roots of a 'Patch-Note Oak' rose up like a wall, their jagged edges looking just as lethal as the slime. He was being hemmed in. To his left, a thicket of thorns that hummed with static electricity; to his right, a steep drop into a ravine filled with purple fog.\n\nThe slime moved again, cutting off his only clear path back toward the spawn point. It was moving with a strange, predatory intelligence, its gelatinous body stretching out to cover more ground.\n\nArtie looked at his peripheral vision again. \n\n[HP: 1 / 1]\n\nThe red bar seemed to be mocking him. It was a reminder that he was a glitch in the matrix, a mistake that the world was currently trying to erase. One point of damage. That was all it would take. A single drop of acid, a stray thorn, a fall of more than two feet.\n\n\"I can't dodge forever,\" Artie muttered, his back hitting the cold, metallic bark of the tree. \n\n\"Correct,\" Fizz said, floating closer. Her snarky expression softened just a fraction, though her voice remained sharp. \"You\u2019re a glass cannon, Artie. But right now, you\u2019re just the glass. If you want to be the cannon, you have to actually fire.\"\n\nThe slime gathered itself for a final lunge. It distended, its green body growing thin and taut like a rubber band being pulled to its breaking point. The two black eyes stared at Artie, reflecting his own terrified face.\n\nArtie gripped the Broken Tutorial Sword. His knuckles were white. The air in the Whispering Woods felt heavy, the whispers of the trees reaching a fever pitch as they anticipated the 'Deletion' event. \n\n[Warning: Enemy is charging a Heavy Attack!]\n[Probability of Survival: 0.0001%]\n\n\"Shut up,\" Artie hissed at the notification. \n\nThe slime launched. It was a wall of green death, a solid mass of corrosive sludge flying through the air with the weight of a bowling ball. Artie had nowhere to go. He was cornered, his back against the tree, the jagged roots pinning him in place. \n\nHe raised the sword, but his arms felt like lead. The 1 Strength stat was a heavy burden to carry when your life depended on a single, perfect swing. \n\n\"Come on,\" Artie breathed, the world slowing down as the slime closed the distance. \"Just one hit. Just one damn hit.\"\n\nThe slime was inches away, the smell of its rot filling his nostrils, the heat of its acid beginning to prickle against his skin. Artie swung, not with strength, but with the desperation of a man who had already died once and really didn't want to make a habit of it.\n\nThe broken blade cut through the air, trailing a faint, golden light\u2014the signature of a guaranteed Critical Hit.\n\nBut the slime was already mid-air, its mass shifting, its trajectory aimed directly at Artie\u2019s chest.\n\n\"Artie!\" Fizz shouted, her snark finally replaced by genuine alarm.\n\nThe sword connected with the outer membrane of the slime, but the momentum of the creature didn't stop. It was a collision course, and Artie was the only one with everything to lose.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"characters\": {\n    \"count\": 5,\n    \"status\": \"READY\",\n    \"updated_at\": \"2026-02-06T21:45:27Z\"\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 3\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_001/scene_003.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"DRAFTING\",\n  \"summary\": {\n    \"chapter_so_far\": [\n      \"Artie has died on Earth and entered the System's character creation void after a vending machine accident.\",\n      \"Artie met his guide, Fizz, and reviewed the details of his death.\",\n      \"Artie exploited the character creation system to create a high-variance 'Crit-Only' build.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_facts_ring\": [\n      \"Artie confronted the Snack-O-Matic 3000 over a stuck bag of Zesty Ranch Habanero Hoops.\",\n      \"Artie attempted to rock the vending machine to dislodge his snack, triggering a massive power surge.\",\n      \"The electrical surge electrocuted Artie, leading to his physical death.\",\n      \"The System issued a notification declaring Artie 'TERMINATED' due to a critical error.\",\n      \"Artie's consciousness transitioned into 'The Great Login Screen in the Sky' white void.\",\n      \"Artie's corporate attire and wallet were converted into fantasy starter equipment.\",\n      \"Artie manifested in the void holding a Broken Tutorial Sword.\",\n      \"milestone: artie_died = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: system_login = DONE\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Broken Tutorial Sword (carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Linen Tunic (equipped, container=body)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Single Copper Coin (stowed, container=pockets)\",\n      \"location: The System Void (current status)\",\n      \"Fizz introduced herself as Artie's System Liaison and mocked his cause of death.\",\n      \"Artie reviewed his official [System Notification: Death Report].\",\n      \"The [Character Creation] menu was opened with 50 available points.\",\n      \"Artie reduced Strength, Agility, Intelligence, and Vitality to 1 to maximize Luck to 99.\",\n      \"Artie acquired the titles 'Statistical Anomaly' and 'The Glassest Cannon'.\",\n      \"Artie's final stats were confirmed as 1 HP, 1 MP, and 100% Critical Hit Rate.\",\n      \"Deployment to the tutorial zone, The Whispering Woods, was initiated.\",\n      \"milestone: build_confirmed = DONE\",\n      \"location: The System Void (status: transitioning to Whispering Woods)\"\n    ],\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie met his System Liaison, Fizz, in the white void and reviewed his embarrassing death report involving a vending machine.\",\n      \"Despite Fizz's warnings about the 'trap stat', Artie drained his physical and mental attributes to the minimum to maximize his Luck.\",\n      \"This resulted in a 'Statistical Anomaly' build with 1 HP and a guaranteed 100% Critical Hit rate.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"milestone: artie_died = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: system_login = DONE\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Broken Tutorial Sword (carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Linen Tunic (equipped, container=body)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Single Copper Coin (stowed, container=pockets)\",\n      \"location: The System Void (current status)\",\n      \"milestone: build_confirmed = DONE\",\n      \"location: The System Void (status: transitioning to Whispering Woods)\"\n    ],\n    \"pending_story_rollups\": [],\n    \"story_so_far\": []\n  },\n  \"world\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"CHAR_FIZZ\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"The System Void\",\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"\n    ],\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie met his System Liaison, Fizz.\",\n      \"Fizz used her Data Slate to present Artie's death report.\",\n      \"Artie intentionally drained his base stats to 1 to maximize his Luck stat.\",\n      \"Artie confirmed a 'Crit-Only' build with 1 HP and 100% Critical Hit Rate.\",\n      \"Deployment to The Whispering Woods has been initiated.\"\n    ],\n    \"time\": {}\n  }\n}\n"
