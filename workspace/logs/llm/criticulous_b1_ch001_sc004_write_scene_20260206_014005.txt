PROSE:

The Level 1 Lesser Forest Slime didn't look like a herald of the apocalypse. It looked like a giant, sentient glob of lime-flavored Jell-O that had been dropped on a dusty floor and decided to take its resentment out on the world. But as it rippled, its translucent green body quivering with a rhythmic, wet *thwack-thwack-thwack* against the grass, Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon knew better. 

In this world, that lime-flavored Jell-O was a tactical nuke.

Artie’s back hit the rough, uncaring bark of a massive oak tree. The tree had probably stood for a hundred years, witnessing the rise and fall of empires, or at least the spawning of many, many low-level mobs. Now, it was just a backstop for Artie’s impending demise. 

[Lesser Forest Slime - Lvl 1]
[HP: 10/10]
[Attack: 2]

Two damage. That was it. If the slime so much as sneezed on him, Artie’s 1 HP would vanish, and he’d be nothing more than a footnote in the System’s error logs. 

"Okay, Artie. Think. You’re an analyst. You analyze things. That’s what it says on the LinkedIn profile you’ll never see again," he muttered, his voice cracking. He adjusted his grip on the Rusty Shortsword (Prop). The 'Prop' part of the name really didn't inspire confidence. It felt less like a weapon and more like a piece of stage scenery that had been left out in the rain since the late nineties. 

The slime lunged.

It didn't move fast, but it moved with a terrifying, singular purpose. It launched itself like a wet beanbag, a wobbling mass of green malice aimed directly at Artie’s midsection.

"Not today, dessert!" Artie yelled, swinging the rusted hunk of metal with all the grace of a man trying to swat a fly with a lead pipe.

The sword whistled through the air. It was a clear, direct path. It should have sliced the slime in half. Instead, the blade seemed to hit an invisible wall an inch away from the green surface. 

[Miss!]

"What? I was right there!" Artie screamed. The slime landed in the dirt, leaving a sticky trail of goo just inches from his boots. "That was a hit! I saw it! The hitbox is rigged!"

The slime didn't care about Artie’s grievances regarding collision detection. It turned, its entire body compressing like a spring. 

Artie didn't wait. He stepped forward, trying to catch the monster while it was recovering. He brought the sword down in a vertical chop, a move he’d seen in a dozen fantasy movies. This time, he was sure. He was focused. He was...

[Miss!]

The sword buried itself three inches deep into a protruding oak root. The impact jarred Artie’s teeth, sending a vibration up his arm that felt like it was trying to disassemble his elbow. 

"Two!" Artie gasped, pulling the sword free with a desperate yank. "That’s two misses on a target the size of a beach ball! I have a 100% Crit rate! How can I crit if I can't even touch the damn thing?"

The slime launched again. This time, it aimed higher, going for Artie’s face. He ducked, the green mass flying over his head and slapping against the oak tree behind him with a sound like a wet steak hitting a windowpane. It clung to the bark for a second before sliding down, leaving a steaming trail of corrosive slime.

Artie spun around, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird. He swung a wild, horizontal lash. 

[Miss!]

The blade passed through the space the slime had occupied a millisecond prior. The creature had flattened itself into a pancake, the metal whistling harmlessly over its gelatinous "head."

"Three," Artie whimpered. "The System is mocking me. It has to be. It’s giving me the power of a god and the accuracy of a stormtrooper with a hangover."

He was sweating now. The Tutorial Zone, which had seemed like a peaceful forest only minutes ago, now felt like a claustrophobic arena. The sunlight filtering through the leaves looked like prison bars. He could hear the wind whistling through the branches, sounding suspiciously like the System Administrator laughing at him.

The slime reformed, wobbling with what Artie could only describe as smugness. It didn't have eyes, but he felt judged. 

"Alright, you overgrown gummy bear. Let's try this again."

He lunged forward, a desperate thrust. He put his shoulder into it, aiming for the very center of the green mass. 

[Miss!]

The sword slid off the slime’s curved surface as if the creature were coated in industrial-grade Teflon. The momentum carried Artie forward, and he nearly face-planted into the corrosive trail on the tree. He managed to catch himself, his fingers brushing against the bark just inches from a patch of bubbling sap.

"Four!" Artie roared, his voice echoing through the trees. "I am a statistical anomaly! I am the master of the critical hit! I am... currently being outplayed by a puddle!"

The slime was preparing its biggest lunge yet. It began to vibrate, its green hue deepening as it gathered its strength. The ground beneath it seemed to tremble—or maybe that was just Artie’s legs. 

He had one chance. He took a deep breath, trying to remember everything he’d ever read about combat. *Center your weight. Watch the tell. Don't blink.*

The slime exploded off the ground. 

Artie swung. It was a perfect arc. It was the swing of a hero. It was the swing of a man who was tired of being a level-zero loser in a world governed by math.

[Miss!]

The sword hit a low-hanging branch, snapping it clean off. The branch fell, hitting Artie on the shoulder. It didn't do damage—the System apparently didn't count 'embarrassment' as a status effect—but it was the final insult.

"Five," Artie whispered, his eyes wide as the slime hovered in mid-air, inches from his chest. "I missed five times. I’m dead. I’m actually going to die to a level one slime."

Time seemed to slow down. He could see the individual bubbles of gas trapped inside the slime’s body. He could see the way the light refracted through its translucent skin. He could see his own reflection in the green goo, looking small and terrified.

And then, something clicked. 

It wasn't a physical movement. It was a feeling in the back of his mind, a sudden alignment of variables. The 100% Critical Hit Rate wasn't just a stat; it was a promise. And the System was finally ready to deliver.

Artie didn't think. He didn't aim. He just let the sword move. 

His right hand, still gripping the Rusty Shortsword (Prop), jerked upward in a short, sharp flick. It wasn't even a full swing. It was a twitch. A glitch in the animation.

The tip of the rusted blade touched the very edge of the slime.

The world turned white.

[SUPER-MEGA-ULTRA-CRIT!]

The sound wasn't a *thwack* or a *slice*. It was the sound of a mountain being shattered by a tuning fork. A pillar of pure, blinding golden light erupted from the point of contact. 

The Level 1 Lesser Forest Slime didn't just die. It ceased to exist. Its molecular structure was dismantled so fast that it didn't even have time to register a death animation. It vaporized into a cloud of green steam that was immediately incinerated by the sheer heat of the crit.

But the crit wasn't done. 

The energy wave hit the oak tree behind Artie. The hundred-year-old giant, with its massive trunk and sprawling roots, vanished. There was no falling timber, no cracking of wood. There was only a roar of displaced air as the tree was reduced to toothpicks and then to ash in a fraction of a second.

The shockwave knocked Artie backward, but the System’s weird physics kept him upright. He watched, mouth agape, as the golden light carved a perfect, circular crater into the earth where the tree had stood. The ground was scorched black, the edges of the pit glowing with residual heat.

Silence returned to the Tutorial Zone, broken only by the sound of a few stray leaves fluttering down into the smoking hole.

Then, the notifications started.

[System Notification]
[Target: Lesser Forest Slime (Lvl 1) - DEFEATED]
[Damage Dealt: 9,999,999 (Overkill)]
[Experience Gained: 50 XP]

[Level Up!]
[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon: Level 1 -> Level 2]
[Stat Points Gained: 5]
[Note: Please try to leave some of the environment for the other players. The janitorial sub-routines are complaining.]

Artie stood there, his arm still raised, the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) trembling in his hand. The 'Prop' was now glowing with a faint, dying ember of gold. 

"I..." Artie started, his voice a dry rasp. He looked at the smoking crater. He looked at the empty space where a massive tree had been seconds ago. He looked at his own hands. "I think I might be a little bit broken."

He checked his status bar. 

[HP: 1/1]
[Level: 2]

He was still one stiff breeze away from a Game Over, but he had just deleted a piece of the world's geometry because he’d gotten lucky. No, not lucky. He’d gotten *math*. 

"Level two," he breathed, a hysterical laugh bubbling up in his throat. "I’m level two. And all it took was the total destruction of a local ecosystem."

He sat down on the edge of the crater, his legs finally giving out. The dirt was still warm. He reached into his pocket, feeling the familiar weight of his dead smartphone and his wallet. They felt like relics from a different reality, a place where slimes didn't exist and trees stayed where you put them.

"Okay," Artie said to the empty forest. "If that was a level one slime... I really, really need to find some armor that isn't made of 'Prop' material."

He looked at the sword. It was still rusted. It was still a prop. But in his hands, it felt like a detonator. 

"One hit," he muttered. "One hit is all it takes. Now I just have to figure out how to not miss the next five times."

The sun continued to shine, the birds (the ones that hadn't been vaporized) began to chirp again, and Artie Penhaligon, the Level 2 Glass Cannon, began to plan his next move in a world that was clearly not prepared for his arrival.
