PROSE:

The void didn't smell like ozone or ancient magic; it smelled like a server room that hadn't been dusted since the nineties. I was suspended in a vast, milky nothingness that made my eyes ache if I tried to focus on the horizon—mostly because there wasn't one. 

"Stop squinting, Arthur. You’re making a face like a constipated gargoyle, and it’s messing with the facial recognition software."

I spun around, or tried to. In zero-G, spinning just results in a very slow, very humiliating tumble. A small, glowing figure zipped into my line of sight. She was about the size of a soda can, wings fluttering with the frantic energy of a hummingbird on a caffeine bender. She wore a miniature tailored suit that looked far more expensive than my ruined office gear.

"Who—or what—are you?" I asked, finally stabilizing myself by kicking at the empty air.

"I am Fizz, your assigned System Guide," she said, pulling a tiny holographic tablet from thin air. 

[The Official System Guidebook (v4.2)] (locked)

"And you," she continued, tapping the screen with a translucent fingernail, "are a statistical nightmare. Do you have any idea how hard it is to file a 'Death by Vending Machine' claim? The paperwork alone is going to take me through the next fiscal quarter."

"I was trying to get my Cheesy-Poofs, Fizz. It was a matter of principle."

"It was a matter of twelve volts and a complete lack of self-preservation," she snapped. 

[System Notification]
[Character Creation Phase: INITIALIZING]
[Subject: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[Base Class: Office Drone (Level 1)]
[Available Stat Points: 20]

"Twenty points?" I looked at the floating blue screen. "Is that good? Does that get me a sword? Or maybe a body that isn't currently a cloud of digital dust?"

Fizz hovered near my ear, her wings humming. "Twenty is the standard 'You Lived a Boring Life' package. Most people put ten into Stamina and ten into Strength so they can survive the first five minutes of the tutorial. Given your track record with inanimate objects, I’d suggest putting all twenty into Intelligence. Maybe then you’ll learn not to kick things that are plugged into a wall."

I ignored her. I was staring at the list of attributes. 

[Strength: 5]
[Agility: 5]
[Intelligence: 5]
[Stamina: 5]
[Luck: 1]
[Crit Rate: 0.01%]

"Wait, why is Luck only one? And what’s this Crit Rate?"

"Luck is a premium stat, Arthur. You clearly didn't have much of it back home," Fizz said, yawning. "And Crit Rate is the percentage chance to deal double damage. It’s usually tied to Agility and Luck, but for you, it’s basically a rounding error. Forget about it. Just pump Stamina. You need the HP."

I looked at my current HP readout.

[HP: 10/10]

Ten health points. According to the log of my demise, the vending machine had hit me for twelve. I was a glass figurine in a world made of hammers. 

"If I put points into Stamina, how much HP do I get?" I asked.

"One point of Stamina equals five HP," Fizz replied. "Standard tank build. Do the math, Office Drone."

I looked at the 'Crit Rate' stat again. There was a small, flickering icon next to it—a gear that looked slightly misaligned with the rest of the UI. I reached out, my finger hovering over the plus sign.

"What happens if I touch this?"

"Don't. That’s the sub-menu for advanced multipliers. It’s locked for players under Level 50."

I touched it.

The screen didn't just flicker; it screamed. A high-pitched digital whine echoed through the void, and the blue UI turned a violent, bleeding red.

[WARNING: UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO CORE MULTIPLIERS]
[SYSTEM ERROR: RECALCULATING...]

"Arthur! What did you do?" Fizz shrieked, her tiny suit ruffling as she tried to grab my hand. "Get away from that! You’re going to trigger a hard reset!"

The sliders on the screen began to move on their own. The twenty available points didn't just disappear into the stats; they started draining the base values.

[Strength: 5 -> 1]
[Agility: 5 -> 1]
[Intelligence: 5 -> 1]
[Stamina: 5 -> 0]

"My Stamina is zero?" I gasped. My vision blurred. I felt... thin. Like I was being stretched across a canvas that was too large.

[HP: 10 -> 1]

[Critical Error: Minimum Value Reached]
[Overflow Detected: Redirecting Excess Data to Secondary Variable...]

The numbers beside 'Crit Rate' began to spin like a slot machine. 

[Crit Rate: 0.01%... 10%... 50%... 99.9%...]

"Stop it! Arthur, cancel the allocation!" Fizz was frantically punching commands into her own tablet, but the holographic screen was sparking. "The System is trying to balance the loss of base stats by dumping the potential energy into the nearest active variable! You're breaking the math!"

[Crit Rate: 100%]

The spinning stopped. The red screen turned a calm, terrifying gold.

[Stat Allocation Complete]
[Final Build Confirmed]
[Current Stats:]
[Strength: 1]
[Agility: 1]
[Intelligence: 1]
[Stamina: 0]
[Luck: 1]
[Crit Rate: 100%]
[HP: 1/1]

"One HP," I whispered. "I have one health point."

"You're a glitch," Fizz said, her voice trembling with a mix of awe and pure, unadulterated fury. "You have the physical durability of a wet paper towel, but you have a hundred percent critical hit rate. Do you understand what that means?"

"I'm going to be very good at hitting things?"

"It means if a butterfly sneezes in your general direction, you die," she yelled. "But if you so much as poke a dragon in the eye, the System is going to treat it like a god-slaying blow. You’ve turned yourself into a 'Crit or Quit' build, Arthur. There is no middle ground."

[New Title Gained: The Glass Anomaly]
[Description: You are a walking rounding error. Your existence is a middle finger to the laws of probability. Enjoy your 1 HP. Try not to trip.]

The void around us began to crack. Long, jagged lines of white light tore through the milky nothingness, revealing glimpses of green grass and a sky that was far too blue to be real.

"The tutorial is loading," Fizz said, tucking her tablet away and looking at me with genuine pity. "I'd tell you to good luck, but you only have one point in that, too. Try to stay behind something solid. Like a mountain. Or a very large rock."

"Hey, Fizz?" I said as the floor began to manifest beneath my feet.

"What now, Anomaly?"

"Does the tutorial have vending machines?"

She didn't answer. The light swallowed us both, and the world of Crit Hit & Run began to render.
