# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Mechanics contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and labels (stats/skills) must be sourced from state or explicitly updated in the state_patch. Do not invent numbers or canonical tokens.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.


USER:

# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Check that any UI numbers or skill values in prose match state stats/skills. If not, emit a failure.
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The Mayor’s office smelled of old parchment, expensive wax, and the faint, ozone-heavy scent of a System-monitored climate control. Behind a desk carved from a single block of Obsidian-Oak, the Mayor of Oakhaven sat, his eyes darting between a glowing holographic scroll and the man standing before him.

Artie shifted his weight, his boots leaving faint mud streaks on the plush carpet. In his left hand, the Participation Trophy pulsed with a rhythmic, sickly neon light, its "Aura of the Beacon" making the shadows in the corner of the room dance nervously. In his right, he gripped the hilt of the Broken Tutorial Sword, mostly because he didn't have a scabbard and dropping it might accidentally trigger a collision-detection glitch.

"Statistical Anomaly," the Mayor whispered, the words tasting like gold on his tongue. He was a portly man with a silver chain of office that displayed his current Level (42) and Social Standing (Exalted). "The gate scanner hasn't thrown a Fatal Error like that since the Great Patch of '04. Do you have any idea what you are, Mr. Penhaligon?"

"A guy who really needs a chair and maybe a sandwich?" Artie suggested.

[Stamina: 12/100]
[Status: Winded (Recovery Rate -50%)]

The hunger bar in the corner of his vision was flickering a threatening shade of orange. But he kept his posture straight. He couldn't afford to look weak. In a world where a stiff breeze could deplete his entire 1 HP health pool, looking like a "glass cannon" was fine. Looking like "shattered glass" was a death sentence.

"You are a walking mint," the Mayor said, standing up. He rounded the desk, his eyes locked on Artie’s character sheet—or at least the parts the System hadn't redacted with "Error 404" messages. "A 100% Critical Hit rate. Do you understand the economic implications? Most artisans spend decades trying to reach a 5% 'Masterwork' proc rate. You? You could tap a piece of raw iron and it would come out a Vorpal Blade just because the System doesn't know how to roll a 'normal' result for you."

"I'm more of a 'vaporize the tutorial wolf' kind of guy," Artie said, keeping his voice steady. "I don't do much blacksmithing."

"You will," the Mayor countered, a predatory smile stretching his cheeks. "Oakhaven is a hub of commerce, and commerce requires stability. Your presence is... unstable. Therefore, the municipal code requires a 'Variance Tax' for all anomalies of Tier 3 or higher."

[System Notification: New Quest Offered - The Mayor’s Cut]
[Objective: Pay 500 Gold in 'Variance Taxes' or provide 10 pieces of 'Crit-Forged' equipment.]
[Reward: Citizenship, 500 XP, 1x 'Safe Zone' voucher.]
[Failure: Immediate deportation to the 'Unpatched Wilds'.]

"Five hundred gold?" Artie barked, nearly dropping the trophy. "I have exactly one copper coin and a trophy that makes every monster within a three-mile radius want to eat my face. I'm not a bank."

The Mayor leaned in, his Level 42 aura pressing against Artie like a physical weight. "Then you'd better start swinging that broken toothpick of yours at something valuable. Or perhaps, I could 'invest' in your potential. A small contract. You provide Oakhaven with a guaranteed 'Crit-Output' for our local guild, and I overlook the fact that your HP is..." He paused, squinting at the blurred red bar above Artie's head. "Well, it’s remarkably low, isn't it? One might almost say it's a rounding error."

Artie’s heart hammered against his ribs. If the Mayor realized that a single poke from his ceremonial Town Seal would result in Artie’s immediate deletion, the negotiation was over. The Mayor wouldn't tax him; he’d harvest him.

"It's a specialized build," Artie lied, his voice dropping into a low, confident register he usually reserved for arguing with tech support. "The System balances the 100% Crit by compressing my health into a 'Perfect Guard' state. I don't need HP if I never get hit. And trust me, you don't want to see what happens when the 'Reflect' damage procs on a 100% Crit build."

It was total nonsense, a bluff built on the shaky foundation of the System's own bad math. But the Mayor hesitated. In this world, the weirdest builds were often the most dangerous.

"A bold claim," the Mayor muttered, stepping back. "But a Statistical Anomaly is, by definition, an unknown variable. I’ll give you twenty-four hours to find a way to pay that tax, Penhaligon. Until then, you are a guest of Oakhaven. But remember: in this town, we don't worship the gods. We worship the roll. And right now? Your rolls are the only thing keeping you from being recycled into raw data."

Artie turned to leave, the Participation Trophy’s glow illuminating the Mayor’s greedy expression. As the heavy oak doors clicked shut behind him, Artie let out a breath he didn't know he was holding. 

He was in. He was safe—for now. But he was also a marked man. In a town where 'Crits' were currency, he wasn't just a player. He was a jackpot waiting to be hit.

"Fizz," Artie whispered to the empty air, "we need to find a way to turn 'breaking the game' into 'paying the rent' before that guy decides to check my stats with a crossbow."
