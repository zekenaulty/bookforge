Your writing is characterized by a tight, limited third-person perspective that never breaks into omniscient narration. You must maintain strict continuity, ensuring that characters utilize their full range of established skills and knowledge. Do not use 'As you know' dialogue or provide summaries of previous events. When a scene begins, drop the reader directly into the character's current sensory experience. Avoid clich\u00e9s in descriptions; instead of 'cold as ice,' describe the 'brittle, biting snap of air that makes the lungs ache.' Ensure all plot payoffs are seeded with subtle clues in earlier movements. Magic and high-fantasy elements must have clear costs and logical consistency.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\n",

Kaelen dived behind a heavy oak lectern, the floor shrieking as it sheared away from the Spire\u2019s central spine. His right arm vibrated with a frequency that threatened to liquefy the marrow, the pewter filament woven into his radius bone grinding against the inner cortex with every frantic heartbeat. In his satchel, the star-shard answered with a rhythmic, white-hot thump-hiss that felt less like a sound and more like a physical blow against his ribs.\n\nAcross the sloping chamber, Varkas stood at an impossible angle, anchored to the stone by the violet light bleeding from the fracture in his chest. He wasn't the man who had taught Kaelen the first tenets of the Oath anymore; he was a hollowed-out vessel of star-glass and void-shadow. The commander\u2019s boots were fused to the marble by crystalline growths that pulsed in time with the dying Spire.\n\n\"The maps, Kaelen,\" Varkas said. His voice was a discordant harmony, two tones overlapping\u2014one familiar and gravelly, the other a high, crystalline chime that made Kaelen\u2019s ears bleed. \"They are the only things left to burn. Let the history of our failure go to the dark.\"\n\nVarkas raised a hand, and the air in the sanctum turned brittle. The temperature plummeted instantly, frost spiderwebbing across the archive racks. Kaelen\u2019s breath came in ragged, frozen puffs that scorched his throat like inhaled glass. He reached into his satchel, his fingers brushing the cold, jagged surface of the star-shard. The moment of contact sent a jolt of ice-water through his nervous system, a surge of power that made the pewter filament in his arm glow a dull, sickly orange through his skin. The shard didn't just pulse; it pulled. It recognized the corruption in Varkas as kin and as prey.\n\n\"You're not him,\" Kaelen hissed, his teeth aching from the sudden, unnatural cold. \"Varkas died when the first ward broke. You're just the rot he left behind.\"\n\n\"Varkas was a jailer,\" the thing in the commander's skin replied, its violet eyes swirling with event horizons. \"I am the key to the gate he couldn't hold.\"\n\nThe heavy archive table between them disintegrated, turning into fine, violet dust that hung in the air, defiant of the Spire's tilting gravity. Kaelen lunged forward, his boots skidding on the frost-slicked marble. He drew his short-blade, the steel reflecting the bruised light of the room. He didn't aim for the heart; he knew there was nothing left there but a core of alien glass. Instead, he aimed for the throat, for the place where the pewter filament of Varkas\u2019s own Oath-binding was visible beneath the translucent, purple-veined skin.\n\nVarkas moved with a fluid, terrifying speed, his arm snapping out to catch Kaelen\u2019s wrist. The contact was like grabbing a frozen iron bar. Frost-burn bloomed instantly across Kaelen\u2019s forearm, the skin turning the color of a bruised plum as the cold bit through his leather bracer.\n\nKaelen roared, not in pain, but in a desperate attempt to force the shard\u2019s resonance through his own arm. He opened the gates of his Oath, letting the unstable essence of the star-shard flood the pewter filament in his bone. The reaction was violent. A metallic scent, sharp and biting like copper on the tongue, filled the air as the filament heated to a white-hot glow. The resonance clash sent a shockwave through the room, blowing the stained-glass windows outward into the abyss below.\n\nVarkas recoiled, his violet eyes flickering. For a second, the commander\u2019s true face surfaced\u2014a mask of absolute, unadulterated terror. \"Kaelen... stop... the light... it burns...\"\n\n\"I can't,\" Kaelen choked out, his lungs feeling as if they were filled with liquid lead. \"The Oath is broken, Commander. You broke it the moment you let the stars in.\"\n\nKaelen twisted the blade, driving the edge through the crystalline growths and into the commander\u2019s core. He didn't pull back. He pushed, channeling every ounce of the shard's hunger directly into Varkas. The thump-hiss reached a deafening crescendo, a rhythmic thrumming that shook the very foundations of the Spire.\n\nVarkas\u2019s body began to fracture. Lines of brilliant, blinding violet light spiderwebbed across his skin, following the paths of his veins. The star-glass in his chest hummed with a high-pitched scream, then shattered. The explosion wasn't outward, but inward\u2014a sudden, violent vacuum that pulled the air from Kaelen\u2019s lungs and the light from the room.\n\nVarkas collapsed, his form dissolving into a heap of dull, gray ash and jagged violet shards. The pressure in the room vanished, replaced by the howling wind of the storm outside and the distant sound of the Spire\u2019s lower levels pancaking into the valley.\n\nKaelen slumped against the archive rack, his right arm hanging limp and blackened by starwrought scarring that traced the path of the pewter filament. His breath hitched, each inhale a battle against the frost-burn in his chest. He couldn't stay. The floor gave another sickening lurch, the angle now so steep that the heavy archive racks began to slide toward the shattered windows.\n\nHe scrambled toward the central dais, his fingers clawing at the stone. There, inside a reinforced brass cylinder etched with the constellations of the Old Era, lay the Star-Maps. He grabbed the cylinder, the metal freezing to his palm, and shoved it into his satchel alongside the pulsing shard. The two objects vibrated against each other, a discordant harmony of old duty and new threat.\n\nThe Spire groaned one last time\u2014a final, terminal sound of structural failure. The ceiling began to rain dust and massive chunks of masonry. Kaelen didn't look back at the remains of his commander. He turned toward the archway leading to the outer battlements, his boots finding purchase on the crumbling stone as he began a desperate, uphill sprint toward the only exit left before the High Spire became a tomb.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n
