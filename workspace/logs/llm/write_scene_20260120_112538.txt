PROSE:

The floor groaned, a deep, tectonic protest that vibrated through Kaelen’s boots, and then the world tilted. It wasn't a gentle shift. The Inner Sanctum of the High Spire lurched ten degrees to the west, sending a cascade of silver ink-pots and ivory quills sliding across the marble floor. Kaelen slammed his left shoulder against a support pillar, his fingers clawing for purchase against the cold stone. His right arm, mapped with the jagged, black starwrought scarring of his fractured Oath, screamed in silent, rhythmic agony.

"The Spire is falling, Varkas," Kaelen rasped. The air in the sanctum was brittle, thinned by the violet haze of star-bleed that leaked from the walls. Every breath felt like inhaling ground glass; his lungs were scorched, the familiar scent of burnt copper thick on his tongue. "Let the maps go. There is nothing left to guard."

Commander Varkas stood at the center of the tilting room, his boots seemingly fused to the shifting floor. He didn't look like the man who had overseen Kaelen’s initiation into the Order. His uniform was tattered, the heavy wool scorched away to reveal a chest cavity that had become a nightmare of geometry. Where a heart should have beat, a cluster of translucent star-glass erupted from his ribs, pulsing with a bruised, sickly violet light. The resonance of it—a wet, rhythmic *thump-hiss*—echoed the pulse of the shard in Kaelen’s satchel, but Varkas’s sound was distorted, a jagged parody of the celestial rhythm.

"Guard?" Varkas’s voice was a dry rattle, as if his vocal cords had been replaced by parchment. He didn't turn around. He was staring at the Great Ocular, the massive brass telescope that was now aimed not at the sky, but at the churning void where the valley used to be. "We weren't guarding the world from the stars, Kaelen. We were keeping the stars from their rightful meal. The Oath was a muzzle. I have simply removed it."

Varkas turned. His eyes were gone, replaced by twin pits of violet fire that mirrored the corruption in his chest. He raised a hand, and the star-glass in his chest flared. The *thump-hiss* intensified, a physical pressure that hammered against Kaelen’s eardrums.

Kaelen didn't wait. He lunged, his boots skidding on the slick marble. He drew his short-blade, the steel humming as it caught the ambient violet light. He ignored the grinding sensation in his radius bone—the pewter filament of his Oath protesting the sudden, violent movement. He swung for Varkas’s neck, a desperate, killing blow meant to end the confrontation before the Spire’s structural failure became absolute.

Varkas moved with a sickening, fluid grace that defied the laws of bone and sinew. He didn't parry; he simply leaned back, the air around him shimmering with a heat-haze of void-energy. Kaelen’s blade passed through a pocket of distorted space, the metal instantly frosting over with a brittle, white rime. The cold bit into Kaelen’s hand, a flash of frost-burn that numbed his fingers.

"You still fight for a ghost, boy," Varkas said. He stepped forward, his movement a blur. He caught Kaelen’s wrist—the scarred one.

The contact was an explosion of sensory overload. The black scarring on Kaelen’s arm flared white-hot. The shard in his satchel screamed, its *thump-hiss* synchronizing with the star-glass in Varkas’s chest. Kaelen felt the pewter filament in his marrow vibrate so violently he thought the bone would shatter. He tasted salt and ozone.

Varkas’s grip was like a vice of frozen iron. "Feel it," the Commander whispered. "The stars don't hate us. They are just hungry."

Kaelen buckled, his knees hitting the marble. The Spire gave another violent shudder. Above them, the massive crystal dome of the sanctum began to spiderweb with cracks. A piece of masonry the size of a carriage fell from the ceiling, smashing into the archives at the far end of the room. The impact sent a cloud of dust and pulverized paper into the air, and then the violet fire caught. 

The archives—centuries of star-charts, lineage records, and forbidden lore—ignited in a flash of bruised light. The fire didn't produce smoke; it produced a shimmering distortion that ate the air.

"The maps..." Kaelen gasped. He forced his left hand into his satchel, his fingers brushing the jagged edge of the star-shard. 

The moment he touched the shard, the world narrowed to a single point of resonance. The *thump-hiss* became a roar. Kaelen didn't try to channel the power; he simply stopped resisting it. He let the shard’s alien rhythm flood into the pewter filament of his Oath, bridging the gap between his failing humanity and the star-matter.

The discharge was blinding. A wave of white-violet force erupted from Kaelen’s arm, shattering Varkas’s grip and throwing the Commander back across the tilting floor. Kaelen slumped, his lungs feeling as though they had been doused in lye. He coughed, spitting a glob of dark, metallic blood onto the white stone.

Varkas slammed into the base of the Great Ocular, the star-glass in his chest cracking from the impact. He tried to stand, but the corruption was losing its cohesion. The violet light in his eyes flickered, revealing for a brief, agonizing second the terrified man underneath.

"Kaelen..." Varkas’s voice was human for a heartbeat. "Finish it. Before the... before the void..."

The Commander’s body jerked. The star-glass heart surged, the shards growing, piercing through his leather armor, weaving a crystalline web around his throat. He was becoming a conduit, a physical anchor for the starfall’s hunger.

Kaelen forced himself up. The floor was now at a twenty-degree angle. He had to climb the slope of the marble, his boots finding purchase on the edges of fallen books and shattered glass. The heat from the burning archives was becoming unbearable, a dry, searing wind that smelled of old glue and ancient secrets.

He reached the brass cases at the edge of the inferno. The Star-Maps. They were housed in three heavy cylinders, etched with the constellations that had guided the Order for a thousand years. Kaelen grabbed the leather strap of the cases, slinging them over his shoulder. The weight was significant, pulling at his injured arm, but he didn't let go.

Varkas was a silhouette of violet light now, a jagged thing of glass and shadow. He lunged one last time, his fingers elongated into talons of star-matter.

Kaelen didn't use his blade. He reached out with his scarred arm and pressed his palm directly against the cracked star-glass in Varkas’s chest. 

The resonance hit like a physical blow. Kaelen felt the shard in his satchel pulse in perfect, terrible unison with the heart of his mentor. He poured everything he had left—every scrap of his Oath, every ounce of his remaining life force—into the connection. He wasn't fighting the corruption; he was overloading it.

The *thump-hiss* reached a crescendo that transcended sound. It became a vibration that threatened to unmake the very atoms of the Spire. 

Varkas’s body stiffened. The star-glass heart glowed with the intensity of a dying sun, and then it shattered. 

The explosion was silent. A wave of violet dust washed over Kaelen, coating his armor in a fine, shimmering rime. Varkas collapsed, the glass in his chest turning to dull, grey ash. The light left his eyes, and the Commander of the High Spire was gone, leaving only a hollowed-out husk on a floor that was no longer stable.

Kaelen didn't have time to mourn. 

A deafening crack echoed through the sanctum as the main support beam of the Spire finally gave way. The entire room groaned and began to slide. The Great Ocular tore free from its mountings, crashing through the outer wall and vanishing into the mist below. 

Kaelen scrambled toward the jagged hole where the telescope had been. The archives were a wall of violet flame behind him, the heat peeling the skin from the back of his neck. He clutched the Star-Maps to his chest, the brass cylinders cold against his scorched palms.

He stood at the edge of the abyss. Below him, the High Spire was a needle of stone being swallowed by a sea of violet fog. The world was falling apart, the stars were falling, and he was the only one left with the key to understanding why.

He looked down at his right arm. The black scarring had deepened, the skin around it puckered and grey. He could feel the shard in his satchel, its *thump-hiss* now a steady, haunting companion to his own heartbeat. 

The Spire shuddered one last time, a final, terminal tilt. 

Kaelen didn't look back at the burning archives or the body of the man who had taught him how to hold a blade. He took a breath of the thin, metallic air, tightened his grip on the maps, and leapt into the void.
