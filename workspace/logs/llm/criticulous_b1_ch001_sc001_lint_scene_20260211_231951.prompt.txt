# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
Prose hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative ("left hand", "right hand", "Artie", "his wallet").
Item naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.
Appearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Continuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.
Continuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.
Durable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.
JSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.
Inventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

﻿Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.
Durable vs ephemeral mechanics:
- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.
- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.
- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).
- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.
For durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
For durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).
Use canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.
- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.
  - INVALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": {"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}
  - VALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": [{"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}]


USER:

﻿# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Classify UI/prose mechanic claims as DURABLE or EPHEMERAL before enforcing.
  - DURABLE: persistent stats/caps, skills/titles acquired, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, named mechanics referenced as invariants.
  - EPHEMERAL: roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat telemetry.
- Enforce DURABLE claims against authoritative_surfaces/state/registries.
- EPHEMERAL claims do not require state ownership; only flag EPHEMERAL contradictions inside the same scene as warnings.
- If uncertain, default to EPHEMERAL (warning at most), not DURABLE (error).
- status="fail" only if there is at least one issue with severity="error"; warnings alone => status="pass".
- Item naming enforcement scope:
  - Do not require that every mention in narrative prose use display_name.
  - Enforce canonical display_name for: (a) anchoring at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences),
    (b) any custody-change sentence (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer), and (c) any case where a descriptor is ambiguous among multiple durable items in the scene.
  - Otherwise, treat non-canonical descriptive references as warnings at most.
- Naming severity policy:
  - warning: unambiguous descriptor used post-anchor.
  - error: missing anchor, descriptor used during custody-change without canonical name, or ambiguity risk.

- Appearance enforcement (authoritative surface):
  - APPEARANCE_CHECK is authoritative for cast_present_ids.
  - Compare APPEARANCE_CHECK tokens to appearance_current atoms/marks (alias-aware).
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK contradicts appearance_current, emit error code "appearance_mismatch".
  - Prose-only appearance contradictions are warnings unless explicitly durable and uncorrected in-scene.
  - If prose depicts a durable appearance change but scene_card.durable_appearance_changes does not include it and no appearance_updates are present, emit error code "appearance_change_undeclared".
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK is missing for a cast member, emit warning code "appearance_check_missing".
- For authoritative surfaces, prefer exact canonical item/device labels from registries.
- For milestone repetition/future checks, compare against PRE-INVARIANTS only (pre-scene canon).
- For ownership/consistency checks, compare against POST-STATE (post-patch candidate).
- POST-STATE is canonical; character_states is a derived convenience view. If they contradict, emit pipeline_state_incoherent.
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).
  - Ignore first-person pronouns inside quoted dialogue; only narration counts.
- Deterministically enforce scene-card durable constraints (required_in_custody, required_scene_accessible, forbidden_visible, device_presence; optional required_visible_on_page).
- Durable constraint evaluation must use POST-STATE candidate (after patch), not pre-state.
- Report missing durable context ids with explicit retry hints instead of guessing canon.
- Input consistency check (mandatory, before issuing continuity/durable errors):
  - If MUST_STAY_TRUE invariants contradict the provided post-patch candidate character state, treat this as an upstream snapshot error.
  - In that case emit a single error issue with code "pipeline_state_incoherent" including evidence of the invariant and the conflicting state field.
  - Do NOT emit additional continuity errors for the same fields when pipeline_state_incoherent is present.
- If pipeline_state_incoherent is present, issues MUST contain exactly one issue.
- For each issue, include evidence when possible (line number + excerpt) as {"evidence": {"line": N, "excerpt": "..."}}.
- Evaluate consistency over the full scope of the scene, not a single snapshot.
  - Transitional state: a temporary mismatch later corrected or superseded within this scene.
  - Durable violation: a mismatch that persists through the end of the scene or ends unresolved.
  - You MUST read the entire scene and build a minimal timeline of explicit state claims/updates (UI lines, inventory changes, title/skill changes, location/time claims).
  - If you detect an apparent inconsistency, you MUST search forward for later updates that resolve or supersede it.
  - Only produce FAIL for durable violations. If resolved within the scene, do NOT FAIL; at most emit a warning.
  - When the same stat appears multiple times, the last occurrence in the scene is authoritative unless an explicit rollback is stated.
  - Any durability violation must cite both the conflicting line and the lack of later correction (or state "no later correction found").

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity
- evidence

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The fluorescent light above the vending machine flickered with a rhythmic, dying buzz that matched the throbbing behind my eyes. It was 11:47 PM. I had been in this cubicle-hell for fourteen hours, and the only thing standing between me and a complete psychological collapse was a bag of Extreme-Zesty Ranch Corn Chips.

I looked down at my right hand. I was holding the crumpled dollar bill like it was a holy relic. It was limp, damp with the sweat of a man who had spent the last twenty minutes digging through his car's floor mats for loose change, and featured a tear along George Washington’s neck that looked suspiciously like a foreshadowing of my own career path.

"Don't you do it," I whispered to the machine. "Not tonight, Brutus."

The machine, a Model 4000 Snack-Master that smelled faintly of ozone and regret, hummed back at me. Its internal cooling fan sounded like a jet engine trying to take off in a vat of pudding. I took a breath, smoothed the crumpled dollar bill against the cold glass of the machine’s front, and fed it into the bill validator.

The machine whirred. It took the bill halfway, hesitated, and then spat it back out with a sound of pure, mechanical disgust.

[System Notification: Skill Check Failed]
[Charisma: 0.1 (Base 12 - 11.9 Fatigue Penalty)]
[Outcome: Critical Rejection]

I blinked. I wasn't sure if I was hallucinating the floating text or if the lack of sleep had finally cracked my perception of reality. The words were a translucent, neon blue, hovering just at the edge of my vision. I shook my head, but they didn't disappear. They just drifted slightly to the left, bobbing like a buoy in a sea of fluorescent static.

"Great," I muttered, reaching into my pocket to pat my leather wallet. It was empty, save for a dry-cleaning receipt and a loyalty card for a coffee shop that had gone out of business in 2019. I checked my other pocket, feeling the cold, shattered screen of my cracked smartphone. No help there. It was just me and the bill.

I smoothed the crumpled dollar bill again, using the edge of the machine's coin slot to flatten the creases. I tried to be gentle. I tried to be seductive. I fed it back in.

The machine swallowed it. The validator groaned, the gears gnashing together, and then—silence. 

No credit appeared on the LED display. The number '0.00' stared back at me, mocking my existence.

"Hey!" I barked, slapping the glass. "That was my last buck! Give it back!"

I pressed the coin return button. Nothing. I mashed it. The button was sticky, probably coated in a decade’s worth of spilled soda and failure. I leaned my forehead against the glass, looking at the Extreme-Zesty Ranch Corn Chips hanging precariously from the metal coil at position D4. They were so close. 

[Vending Machine - Lvl 0 (Inanimate)]
[HP: 10/10]
[Status: Indifferent]

There it was again. The UI. It was labeling the machine like a boss in an RPG. I laughed, a dry, hacking sound that felt like swallowing sandpaper. If I was going crazy, at least my brain was being thematic about it. 

"Fine," I said, stepping back and rolling up the sleeves of my wrinkled dress shirt. "We're doing this the hard way."

I balled my right hand into a fist. I wasn't a fighter. I was a guy who spent his days reconciling spreadsheets and his nights wondering where it all went wrong. But I wanted those chips. 

I punched the machine’s side, right where the "Push for Change" sticker was peeling off.

[Attack: Unarmed Strike]
[Damage: 0]
[Status Effect: Glitched: Crit-Only (Active)]

The impact jolted up my arm, but the machine didn't even rattle. The blue text popped up again, flashing a zero so large it felt personal. I hit it again. Left hook. Right cross. A desperate, two-handed shove.

[Damage: 0]
[Damage: 0]
[Damage: 0]

"What do you mean, zero?" I yelled at the empty breakroom. "I'm hitting it! It’s a physical object! Physics! Look it up!"

I was panting now. My Agility was clearly not up to the task of urban combat. I looked at the machine, and for a second, I could swear the humming changed pitch. It went from a low drone to a high-pitched whine, like a capacitor charging up for something big.

[Warning: Environmental Hazard Detected]
[Status: Critical Fault in Progress]

"I just want my chips," I whimpered. I gave the machine one final, frustrated kick. My foot connected with the base of the unit, right where a frayed power cord snaked out from underneath the metal chassis.

There was a pop. A bright, blue spark jumped from the cord to my damp shoe.

[Critical Hit Received! -10 HP]

The world didn't just go dark; it went electric. A surge of white-hot agony tore through my legs, up my spine, and out through the top of my skull. It felt like my nervous system was being used as a guitar string for a heavy metal solo played by a god of lightning. 

I fell back, my limbs jerking in a dance I hadn't rehearsed. My cracked smartphone flew out of my pocket, clattering across the linoleum. My leather wallet followed, spilling its useless contents. 

I hit the floor, my vision tunneling. The fluorescent lights above were spinning, turning into a kaleidoscope of flickering white bars. 

[HP: 0/10]
[Status: Deceased (Pending...)]

[System Notification: Unique Build Detected]
[Error: 100% Critical Hit Rate detected in non-combatant entity.]
[Recalculating...]

"Is... is that... it?" I gasped, though I wasn't sure if I was actually speaking or just thinking the words into the void. 

The vending machine loomed over me, a dark monolith in the flickering light. The Extreme-Zesty Ranch Corn Chips finally slipped from the coil, falling the six inches to the bottom tray with a soft, mocking *thud*. 

[Loading Screen...]
[Tip: Always check your surroundings for environmental hazards. Also, try not to die with zero gold. It’s embarrassing.]

The breakroom dissolved into a sea of gray pixels. The sound of the humming machine faded, replaced by a low, melodic chime—the kind of sound that usually precedes a very expensive microtransaction. 

My last thought, as the world faded to a loading bar that was stuck at 99%, was that I never even got to taste the ranch.
