PROSE:

The smoke rising from the fifty-foot furrow smelled like ozone and burnt spreadsheets. Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stood at the epicenter of the devastation, his boots sinking into the translucent, gelatinous remains of the Level 1 Slime. Even though the creature’s HP bar had flickered into a flat gray zero, the physical contact invariant remained stubbornly active; the cooling slime-goo clung to his shins like a desperate, defeated ex.

Artie gripped the hilt of his Broken Tutorial Sword in his right hand, his knuckles white. His lungs burned, and his heart hammered a frantic rhythm against his ribs. He glanced at his peripheral vision, where the UI was struggling to keep up with the reality of a localized tactical nuke.

[HP: 1/1]
[MP: 1/1]
[Stamina: 88/100]
[Status: Level 2 - Statistical Anomaly]
[Location: The System Void (Error: Desync Detected)]

"That," Artie wheezed, wiping a streak of soot from his forehead with his free hand, "was significantly more explosive than the manual suggested."

Fizz hovered a few feet away. Her translucent wings buzzed with a high-pitched whine that suggested her internal processors were redlining. She wasn't looking at the smoking crater or the furrow that stretched toward the horizon; she was staring at the Data Slate gripped in her left hand, her eyes darting across lines of scrolling green text.

"Artie," she said, her voice dropping the practiced, airy guide-tone for something much sharper. "The System just had to rewrite three sub-routines to account for the fact that you deleted a protected environmental asset. You didn't just kill a slime; you murdered a Patch-Note Oak. Those things are literally made of the world's structural code. The System is still trying to figure out if we’re in the Whispering Woods or if you’ve punched us back into the character creation void."

"It was self-defense," Artie argued, though his voice lacked conviction as he looked at the smoldering stump of the tree. "The tree was in the way of my destiny. Or at least my swing. Besides, I leveled up. Doesn't the System like progression?"

"The System likes predictable variables, Artie. You are a rounding error with a sword."

As if on cue, a golden light coalesced in the air between them. It wasn't the majestic, shimmering glow of a legendary drop. It was a dull, sickly yellow, pulsating with the rhythmic thrum of a failing fluorescent bulb. It flickered, casting long, jagged shadows across the crater.

[System Notification]
[Achievement Unlocked: 'Well, You Tried!']
[Item Received: Participation Trophy]
[Rarity: Common (Cursed/Soul-bound)]
[Description: Awarded to the player who manages to cause a Tier 3 System Error before finishing the movement tutorial. You’re special, Arthur. Not 'hero' special. The other kind.]

A heavy, bronze-colored statue of a man tripping over his own shoelaces materialized out of the glitching light. It dropped straight into Artie’s left hand. It weighed at least ten pounds and felt unnervingly warm, as if it were still radiating the heat of the System’s annoyance.

"A trophy?" Artie managed a weak grin, despite the biting description. "See, Fizz? Recognition. I’m an achiever. First five minutes in the world and I’ve already got hardware."

Fizz didn't smile. She tapped her slate aggressively, her brow furrowing until her digital eyes were nearly shut. "Artie, put that down. Or better yet, delete it. Throw it into the furrow. Bury it."

"It says it's soul-bound," Artie said, testing the weight. The bronze surface was etched with tiny, screaming faces. "And hey, it’s my first piece of loot. I’m not just going to toss—"

"Artie, look at the hidden stats!" Fizz shouted, shoving her Data Slate toward his face. 

Artie squinted at the screen. Beneath the sarcastic description, a set of red text was blinking in a language that looked suspiciously like a warning label on a nuclear reactor.

[Hidden Stat: Aura of the Beacon]
[Effect: Increases the Aggro Radius of all hostile entities within 1,000 meters by 500%.]
[Hidden Stat: Magnetic Failure]
[Effect: All projectiles within a 20-meter radius have a 95% chance to redirect toward the holder.]
[Hidden Stat: Inevitability]
[Effect: Cannot be unequipped or stored in a sub-dimensional inventory. This item must be carried physically at all times.]

Artie’s grin died a sudden, violent death. "Five hundred percent?"

"It’s a lighthouse," Fizz whispered, her professional mask finally cracking into genuine concern. "Artie, you’re a one-health glass cannon in a tutorial zone that you just nuked. You are currently the loudest thing in the System’s ears, and you just invited every monster in the Whispering Woods to come and see why."

A low, guttural growl echoed from the shadows of the unburnt trees. Then another. And another. The woods, which had been reciting peaceful patch notes about 'Improved Foliage Collision' moments ago, suddenly went silent. Then, the screaming started. Not from people, but from the code itself.

Artie looked at his UI. 

[Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit: Cooldown (23:58:12)]

"Right," Artie said, his voice an octave higher than usual. "And my big 'Delete' button is currently on lunch break for the next twenty-four hours."

"Artie," Fizz said, her wings picking up speed until she was a blur of light. "Look at the mini-map."

He glanced at the corner of his vision. Usually, the map was a sea of peaceful green dots representing neutral mobs and the occasional yellow dot for a slime. Now, it looked like a bowl of strawberry jam. Dozens of red dots were converging on their location from every direction, moving with a speed that suggested they weren't just curious—they were offended.

A bush twenty yards away exploded as a Tutorial Wolf—normally a passive creature that only attacked if a player actively kicked it—leaped out. Its eyes were glowing with a frantic, unnatural red light. It wasn't looking at Artie’s throat; it was staring directly at the bronze trophy in his left hand with a look of pure, unadulterated hatred.

[Tutorial Wolf - Lvl 4 (Aggroed)]
[HP: 120/120]

"Fizz, if I crit it, can I kill it?" Artie asked, shifting his grip on the Broken Tutorial Sword.

"Yes," she snapped, "but there are forty more behind it! You have one hit point! If a single hair on its chin touches you, you're a ghost! You don't have the Dexterity to kite a pack, Artie! Run!"

The wolf snarled and lunged. Artie didn't think. He didn't calculate. He just pivoted on his heel and did the only thing a man with 1 HP and a 500% aggro multiplier could do.

He ran.

"Where are we going?" Artie yelled over his shoulder as he scrambled over the lip of the furrow, the bronze trophy clanking against his side. The weight was awkward, throwing off his balance.

"Away!" Fizz screamed, flying alongside his head. "North! Toward the edge of the zone! If we can reach the transition line, we might be able to break their line of sight, but with that trophy, you’re basically a neon sign in a dark room!"

Artie pushed his legs as hard as they would go. His Agility was bottom-tier, and every step felt like he was running through waist-deep molasses. Behind him, the sound of snapping branches and howling grew louder. It wasn't just wolves anymore. He could hear the wet, rhythmic slapping of slimes—dozens of them—merging into a larger, angrier mass.

[System Notification]
[Environmental Alert: Tutorial Zone Stability at 84%.]
[Reason: Excessive Aggro density in Sector 4.]

"The System is mad at me!" Artie shouted, ducking under a low-hanging branch that scraped his shoulder.

"The System is trying to balance the equation, Artie! And you're the variable that needs to be subtracted!"

A projectile whizzed past Artie’s ear—a glob of corrosive slime. Because of the 'Magnetic Failure' stat on the trophy, the glob actually curved mid-air, trying to hook back toward his head. He dove into a roll, the grass staining his Linen Tunic, and felt the heat of the mucus as it hissed into the dirt where his skull had been a second ago.

[Stamina: 42/100]

Artie scrambled back to his feet, clutching the heavy trophy to his chest like a cursed football. The woods were closing in. Every shadow held a pair of red eyes. The Whispering Woods were no longer whispering; they were screaming in a cacophony of distorted audio files and monster roars.

"I can't keep this up!" Artie panted, his vision blurring at the edges. "I need... a plan... or a shield... or a very large hole!"

"Keep running!" Fizz urged, her Data Slate emitting a frantic red pulse. "There’s a ravine up ahead! If we can get across, we can funnel them!"

"And if I trip?"

"Then I'll make sure your obituary mentions the trophy!"

Artie didn't have the breath to argue. He just ran, the heavy bronze weight in his left hand a constant reminder that in this world, even his rewards were actively trying to kill him.
