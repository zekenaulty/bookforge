PROSE:

The Zesty Ranch Zings hung by a literal thread—a plastic coil that had decided to stop rotating exactly three millimeters short of a successful delivery. I stared at the bag, my reflection in the vending machine’s scratched plexiglass looking back with the hollowed-out eyes of a man who had spent eight hours auditing spreadsheets for a company that sold industrial-grade adhesives.

[Patience: 4/100]

"You’ve got to be kidding me," I muttered. My voice sounded thin in the empty breakroom, competing with the low-frequency hum of a refrigerator that had been dying since the late nineties. 

I looked down at the Smartphone in my right hand. The screen flickered to life: 4:58 PM. Two minutes. I had two minutes left on the clock before I could legally flee this fluorescent purgatory, and the only thing standing between me and a dignified commute was a seventy-five-cent bag of corn-based disappointment. 

I tapped my thumb against the glass of the phone. My current build—if you could call a thirty-two-year-old accountant a 'build'—was heavily specced into [Cynicism] and [Procrastination]. It wasn't a winning meta.

[Skill Check: Cynicism (Level 3) – Success!]
[Observation: The vending machine isn't broken; it's malicious. It knows you’re at your breaking point. It feeds on the tears of the underpaid.]

"I know," I whispered to the empty room. "I know."

I shoved the Smartphone into my pocket for a second to free up my hand, then changed my mind and kept it gripped tight. It was my only connection to a world that didn't smell like burnt coffee and despair. I reached into my left pocket, fingers brushing against the cool, cracked surface of my Leather Wallet. I didn't need more money; I’d already paid. The machine’s digital display was mocking me with a steady, unblinking '0.00'.

I leaned my forehead against the cool plexiglass. "Listen, you oversized toaster. I’ve had a day. Brenda from HR asked me to 'circle back' on a memo six times. My car is making a sound like a cat in a blender. Just give me the Zings."

The machine didn't respond. It just hummed, a steady, vibrating drone that I felt in my teeth. 

[Patience: 2/100]

This was the boss fight of my mundane existence. The Breakroom Golem. Its armor was made of reinforced steel and bad luck. Its loot table was exclusively snacks that expired during the Obama administration. And right now, it was winning.

I shifted my weight, the Keyring in my right pocket jingling as I prepared for a tactical maneuver. In the world of corporate survival, this was known as 'Percussive Maintenance.' To anyone else, it was just kicking the crap out of a machine.

I checked my stats. 

[HP: 100/100]
[Status: Disgruntled]

I was at full health, but my mental resources were tapped. I took a deep breath, shifted my Smartphone to a more secure grip in my right hand, and delivered a measured, frustrated kick to the base of the machine.

*Thud.*

The bag of Zings didn't even quiver. If anything, it seemed to settle deeper into the coil, nestling in for a long winter’s nap.

"Oh, so that’s how it’s going to be?" I snarled. 

[Patience: 1/100]

I grabbed the sides of the machine. It was heavy, bolted to the floor or just weighted down by the collective misery of the accounting department. I began to shake it. The hum from the machine changed pitch—a rising, angry whine that sounded less like a cooling fan and more like a jet engine preparing for takeoff.

"Give! Me! My! Chips!"

I gave it one final, desperate heave. 

Inside the machine, something snapped. Not the plastic coil—that stayed perfectly still. No, the sound came from the back, a sharp, electric *crack* that echoed like a gunshot in the small room. A blue arc of light danced behind the rows of chocolate bars, illuminating the interior with a hellish, flickering glow.

[Warning: Environmental Hazard Detected!]
[System Note: Maybe stop touching the high-voltage equipment, Artie?]

"I don't care about the hazard! I want my—"

The machine didn't just short-circuit. It exhaled. 

A surge of raw, unbridled electricity surged through the metal frame, jumping the gap between the chassis and my sweat-slicked palms. The world didn't go black immediately. First, it went white. A blinding, searing neon white that turned my skeleton into a silhouette.

[Critical Hit! -100 HP]

The pain was brief, mostly because my nerves didn't have time to process the fact that they were being cooked medium-well. I felt a strange sensation of weightlessness, followed by the distinct sound of my Smartphone hitting the linoleum floor with a pathetic *clack*. 

My Leather Wallet felt heavy in my pocket for one last second before the sensation of 'having a body' became a legacy feature I no longer supported.

[HP: 0/100]
[Status: Deceased]

"Well," I thought, the last spark of my consciousness flickering like a dying lightbulb. "At least I don't have to circle back with Brenda."

The breakroom faded. The smell of ozone and Zesty Ranch Zings vanished. The floor, the ceiling, and the crushing weight of my thirty-year mortgage dissolved into a vast, shimmering void of darkness. 

I wasn't standing. I wasn't sitting. I just *was*. 

And then, a window appeared. Not a window made of glass, but a floating, translucent box of light that pulsed with a soft, rhythmic glow.

[Welcome to the Character Creation Suite!]
[Error: Unexpected Termination Detected.]
[Recalculating... Recalculating...]
[User 'Arthur Penhaligon' flagged for 'Exceptional Bad Luck'.]
[Applying Compensation Package: 'The RNG Special'.]

"Great," I thought, or whatever the ethereal equivalent of thinking was. "Even in death, I’m getting a participation trophy."
