  "text": "PROSE:\n\nThe flagstones lurched, a sickening tilt that sent the weight of the three canisters slamming into Kaelen\u2019s ribs. He staggered, the brass cylinders clashing inside his heavy leather satchel with a sound like a funeral knell. Behind him, the Map Room\u2014or what remained of it after Varkas\u2019s blood had cooled on the floor\u2014was being swallowed by a silence more terrifying than the roar of falling stone. The void-influence didn\u2019t just break things; it erased them, turning the solid granite of the High Spire into a fine, ash-like powder that drifted upward against gravity.\n\nKaelen didn\u2019t look back. The smell of scorched copper and ozone burned the back of his throat, a sharp contrast to the stale, cold air of the mountain peak. Every breath felt like inhaling ground glass. He lunged for the doorway, his boots skidding on a floor that was rapidly becoming a slide. His fingers, slick with sweat and the lingering grime of the duel, clawed at the doorframe. The stone felt unnaturally warm, humming with a vibration that set his teeth on edge.\n\nHe forced himself through the archway just as the ceiling groaned and gave way. A slab of masonry the size of a carriage crashed into the space he had occupied seconds before, the impact sending a plume of white dust billowing through the corridor. Kaelen fell forward, the canisters digging into his chest, pinning the wind from his lungs. For a heartbeat, he lay there, gasping, the rhythmic thud of his heart a frantic counterpoint to the slow, tectonic grinding of the fortress.\n\n*Move.*\n\nThe command was a jagged thought, fueled by the dull ache in his marrow. He rolled onto his side, gritting his teeth against the protest of his overstrained muscles. The Star-Maps were a dead weight, thirty pounds of etched lead and star-glass that felt like a hundred. He hauled himself up, using a protruding gargoyle for leverage. The statue\u2019s face was already melting, the stone features softening into a featureless mask under the pressure of the corruption.\n\nThe main staircase was gone. In its place was a jagged maw of purple-black energy, a fracture in the world that bled a lightless luminescence. Kaelen edged along the narrow remains of the gallery, his back pressed against the outer wall. Below him, the clouds were a churning grey sea, thousands of feet down. Above, the Spire\u2019s great spire snapped like a dry twig, the sound muffled as if the air itself were too thin to carry the frequency of destruction.\n\nA section of the gallery floor fell away. Kaelen leapt, his fingers catching a decorative iron sconce. It groaned, the metal bending under his weight and the added burden of the canisters. He swung his body, legs pumping, and threw himself onto a stable ledge leading to the outer ramparts. He landed hard on his shoulder, the impact jarring his teeth, but he didn't stop. He scrambled to his feet, his vision swimming with spots of grey.\n\nThe air on the ramparts was a gale, screaming through the battlements. The Spire was twisting now, the entire structure spiraling inward as the impact site at its base finally surrendered to the void. Kaelen ran, his boots thudding rhythmically on the stone. He could see the jagged path leading down the mountainside\u2014the only way out. \n\nHe reached the final gatehouse, the iron portcullis twisted into a grotesque knot of metal. There was a gap, barely wide enough for a man, choked with rubble. Kaelen threw the satchel through first, hearing the heavy thud of the canisters hitting the scree on the other side. Then he squeezed through, the jagged edges of the gate tearing at his tunic and the skin of his forearms. He didn't feel the pain, only the desperate, animal need to be clear of the shadow.\n\nHe tumbled out onto the mountain slope, sliding twenty feet down a chute of loose shale before his boots found purchase. He didn't stop until he reached a jagged outcropping of granite five hundred yards from the base of the fortress. \n\nKaelen collapsed against the stone, his lungs heaving, the air finally tasting of pine and cold snow instead of the void\u2019s rot. He dragged the satchel toward him, his hands shaking as he touched the cold brass of the canisters. They were intact. The maps were safe.\n\nOnly then did he turn his head.\n\nThe High Spire was no longer a monument of strength. It looked like a pillar of smoke caught in a crosswind. The great stones were drifting upward, dissolving into the swirling vortex of the starfall\u2019s wake. There was no sound\u2014no crash of falling towers, no scream of rending metal. Just a profound, heavy silence as the fortress that had stood for three centuries folded into a single point of absolute blackness and vanished.\n\nThe mountain felt lighter, the sudden absence of the Spire\u2019s weight creating a localized shiver in the earth. Kaelen watched the last of the dust settle. Somewhere back in that void lay the body of Varkas and the history of a disgraced order. \n\nHe looked down at his hands. They were stained with the dark, bruised color of the corruption\u2019s touch, a faint violet tinge beneath the skin of his knuckles. The cost of the oath was already being tallied. He closed his eyes for a moment, the silence of the mountain pressing in on him, then shouldered the heavy satchel and began the long descent into the tree line.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_kaelen\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"High Spire - Lower Slopes/Mountain Path\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Kaelen successfully escaped the High Spire before its total collapse.\",\n      \"The High Spire has been completely consumed by the void-influence, leaving only a scar on the mountain.\",\n      \"Kaelen has the three Star-Map canisters in his possession.\",\n      \"Kaelen is showing early physical signs of void-exposure (discoloration of the skin).\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_oath_binding\",\n      \"THREAD_starfall_corruption\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",

Your writing is characterized by a tight, limited third-person perspective that never breaks into omniscient narration. You must maintain strict continuity, ensuring that characters utilize their full range of established skills and knowledge. Do not use 'As you know' dialogue or provide summaries of previous events. When a scene begins, drop the reader directly into the character's current sensory experience. Avoid clich\u00e9s in descriptions; instead of 'cold as ice,' describe the 'brittle, biting snap of air that makes the lungs ache.' Ensure all plot payoffs are seeded with subtle clues in earlier movements. Magic and high-fantasy elements must have clear costs and logical consistency.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\n",

Every step through the knee-deep peat required a deliberate shift of weight, a calculated gamble against the suction of the black mud. To rush was to sink; to hesitate was to let the stinging gnats find the gaps in the leather greaves.\n\nThe silver needle of the compass didn\u2019t spin; it shuddered, vibrating with a frequency that numbed the thumb pressing against the casing. This wasn't the erratic jitter of a magnetic anomaly, but the rhythmic, heavy thrum of a tethered ley-line. It pulled at the marrow, a dull ache in the long bones that signaled the proximity of a ruptured seal. The price of such proximity was always paid in blood-sugar and breath; the lungs felt scorched, as if the very oxygen had been thinned by the invisible pressure.\n\nA jagged obsidian shard protruded from a stump of petrified oak. It didn't just sit in the light; it seemed to drink it, casting a shadow that fell toward the sun rather than away. Touching it would be a mistake\u2014the last time a finger had brushed a similar fracture, the skin had turned the color of a bruised plum and stayed cold for a week. Instead, the focus remained on the tension of the wire stretched across the path, nearly invisible against the gray mist. It was set at mid-thigh height, weighted with a lead sinker to ensure it wouldn't flutter in the wind. A simple trap, but one that required a steady hand and a sharp eye to bypass without tripping the chime hidden in the hollow log nearby. The world didn't offer warnings, only consequences recorded in the stiffness of joints and the steady, rhythmic thud of a heart working too hard against a thinning atmosphere.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 8\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"outline\": {\n    \"path\": \"outline/outline.json\"\n  },\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_001/scene_008.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"DRAFTING\",\n  \"world\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_kaelen\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"High Spire (Map Room/Inner Sanctum) - Collapsing\",\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_oath_binding\",\n      \"THREAD_starfall_corruption\"\n    ],\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Kaelen killed Commander Varkas in a lethal duel within the Map Room.\",\n      \"Varkas was fully consumed by the silver rot before his death.\",\n      \"Kaelen secured the three Star-Map canisters from the High Spire.\",\n      \"The High Spire has begun its final structural collapse due to the proximity of the starfall impact.\"\n    ],\n    \"time\": {}\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n"
