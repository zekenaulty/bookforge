It vibrated at exactly the same pitch as Arthur Penhaligon\u2019s mounting migraine. Arthur, known to exactly zero people as 'Artie' because he didn't have friends who liked him that much, stared through the scratched plexiglass of the Snack-Master 3000.\n\nIn his right hand, he gripped the 'Rusty Shortsword.' It wasn't a real weapon\u2014at least, it wasn't supposed to be. It was a \"Historical Achievement Award\" for five years of loyal service to Data-Sync Solutions, a company that specialized in moving spreadsheets from one folder to another until the heat death of the universe. The sword was blunt, pitted with actual oxidation, and mounted on a cheap plastic plaque that had snapped off the moment Artie touched it. It was the perfect metaphor for his career: decorative, useless, and slightly toxic.\n\n\"Come on,\" Artie whispered, his voice cracking with the desperation of a man who had skipped breakfast to finish a report on cloud latency. \"Just give me the Rings. Don't do this to me, Greg.\"\n\nHe had named the vending machine Greg. Greg was a jerk.\n\nArtie leaned forward, his forehead pressing against the cold plastic. Inside, the metal coil holding the Zesty Ranchero Rings had made a valiant three-hundred-and-sixty-degree turn, only to stop exactly one millimeter short of liberation. The bag hung there, suspended over the abyss of the delivery chute, dangling by a single, defiant crimp of cellophane. \n\nIt was a 1-in-20 failure. A critical miss on the most important roll of the day.\n\n\"I put in two dollars, Greg,\" Artie said, his grip tightening on the hilt of the rusty award. \"The sticker says one-fifty. You have my fifty cents. You have my dignity. Just drop the damn rings.\"\n\nThe machine responded with a clicking sound that could only be interpreted as a robotic middle finger. The digital display, which usually read 'THANK YOU,' flickered and settled on a cryptic message: ERR_404_SNACK_NOT_FOUND.\n\n\"Not found? I can see it! It's right there!\" Artie shouted, his frustration finally boiling over. \n\nHis life was a series of these minor, statistically improbable tragedies. He was the guy who always got the shopping cart with the one locked wheel. He was the guy whose umbrella always inverted in a light breeze. He was the statistical anomaly that kept the insurance companies in business\u2014the outlier on every bell curve of bad luck. If there was a one percent chance of something going wrong, Arthur Penhaligon was the guy who experienced it one hundred percent of the time.\n\nHe looked down at the 'Rusty Shortsword.' He wasn't a violent man, but the sheer absurdity of holding a medieval weapon in a 21st-century breakroom while being robbed by a machine was too much. \n\n\"You want to play hardball, Greg? Fine. Let's talk about drop rates.\"\n\nArtie didn't kick the machine. He knew the physics of that\u2014he\u2019d likely break a toe, and the machine wouldn't even wobble. Instead, he tried the 'reach-around.' He shoved his left hand into the delivery flap, pushing against the heavy anti-theft bar. His arm snaked upward, fingers straining toward the dangling bag of Zesty Ranchero Rings. \n\n[Stamina: 14/100]\n\nA phantom notification flickered in the corner of his eye, but he dismissed it as a visual artifact of his migraine. He was so close. His fingertips brushed the crinkly plastic.\n\n\"Gotcha, you little...\"\n\nAt that exact moment, the Snack-Master 3000 decided it was done being a vending machine and wanted to try its hand at being a Tesla coil. \n\nIt started with a smell\u2014the ozone-heavy scent of a dying motherboard. Then came the sound: a high-pitched whine that bypassed the ears and vibrated directly in the teeth. The fluorescent lights overhead didn't just flicker; they strobed with the intensity of a dying sun.\n\nArtie felt a tingle in his fingertips. Not the 'my foot fell asleep' tingle, but the 'my atoms are reconsidering their current arrangement' tingle. \n\nThe digital display on the machine went berserk. \n\n[SYSTEM OVERLOAD]\n[UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DETECTED]\n[INITIATING DEFENSIVE PROTOCOL: ARC LIGHT]\n\n\"Wait, what?\" Artie had just enough time to blink.\n\nThe Rusty Shortsword in his right hand acted as a perfect lightning rod. The surge didn't just travel through the machine; it used Artie as a bridge to the grounding wire in the floor. A brilliant, blue-white arc of electricity jumped from the coil to Artie\u2019s hand, channeled through the 'Historical Achievement Award,' and slammed into his chest.\n\nThe world didn't go black. It went neon.\n\nArtie felt himself lifted off his feet. The sensation wasn't pain\u2014it was too fast for pain. It was just... math. He felt his HP bar, a thing he didn't know he had, drain with the speed of a punctured bucket. \n\n-10 HP.\n-25 HP.\n-50 HP.\n\n[Critical Hit!]\n[Damage Type: Electrical/Pure]\n[Status: Fried]\n\nHis last thought as a living human being was remarkably petty: *I hope the company has to pay out my life insurance for a vending machine accident.*\n\nThen, the world finally did go black.\n\n***\n\nArtie floated. \n\nThere was no floor, no ceiling, and importantly, no Greg. There was only a vast, echoing silence that felt like being tucked inside a velvet-lined coffin in the middle of deep space. \n\n\"Hello?\" he tried to say, but he didn't have a mouth. Or a throat. Or a body. He was just a point of consciousness, a lingering 'I am' in a sea of 'Not Yet.'\n\nSuddenly, a box appeared in the darkness. It wasn't a physical box, but a projection of light that seemed to burn directly into his soul.\n\n[Welcome to the After-Lobby!]\n[User: Arthur Penhaligon]\n[Status: Deceased (Cause: Terminal Irony)]\n\n\"Terminal irony?\" Artie thought, the words echoing in the void. \"It was a vending machine!

You're going to need it. (Actually, you have none. Our apologies.)]\n\nThe darkness began to tear open, revealing a blinding green light.

You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the RNG-Hellscape\",\"goal\":\"Introduce Artie and his

No recap.\n- Summaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\n- Use the continuity pack and state for continuity.\n- Use character_registry to keep names consistent in prose.\n- Timeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\n- State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\n- Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n- Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\n- Inventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- For held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\n- If a required event is not in the Scene Card, do not perform it.\n- summary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\n- STATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\n- If state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\n- Return prose plus a state_patch JSON block.\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Use cursor_advance only if you need to override the default cursor.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n  - Each entry must include character_id, chapter, scene, inventory (full current list), containers (full current list), invariants_add (array), persona_updates (array).\n  - If you have a single persona update, still wrap it in an array of strings.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger and invariants using standard phrasing, e.g.:\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> shard (carried, container=satchel)\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> longsword (carried, container=hand_right)\n  - container: satchel (owner=CHAR_example, contents=[shard, maps])\n  - milestone: shard_bind = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - milestone: maps_acquired = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - injury: right forearm scar / left arm filament\n  - ownership: shard (carried) / shard (bound but physical)\n\nScene card:\n{\n  \"cast_present\": [\n    \"Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon\"\n  ],\n  \"cast_present_ids\": [\n    \"CHAR_ARTIE\"\n  ],\n  \"chapter\": 1,\n  \"conflict\": \"Artie vs. a malfunctioning vending machine that has stolen his money and his snacks.\",\n  \"constraints\": [\n    \"target_words: 2000\",\n    \"tone: comedic and cynical\",\n    \"no-recaps\",\n    \"establish Artie's deep-seated frustration with modern life\",\n    \"foreshadow game mechanics through mundane frustrations\"\n  ],\n  \"end_condition\": \"Artie is killed by a freak electrical surge and experiences the first 'System' notification in the darkness.\",\n  \"goal\": \"Establish Artie's personality as a frustrated office drone and execute the inciting incident through a lethal interaction with a vending machine.\",\n  \"introduces\": [\n    \"Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon\"\n  ],\n  \"introduces_ids\": [\n    \"CHAR_ARTIE\"\n  ],\n  \"required_callbacks\": [],\n  \"scene\": 1,\n  \"scene_id\": \"SC_001_001\",\n  \"scene_target\": \"Artie's mundane life ends in an absurd, system-triggered accident, leading to his arrival in the character creation void.\",\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.1\",\n  \"thread_ids\": []\n}\n\nContinuity pack:\n{\n  \"cast_present\": [\n    \"Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon\"\n  ],\n  \"constraints\": [\n    \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Smartphone (dead) (status=stowed, container=pockets)\",\n    \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Wallet (status=stowed, container=pockets)\",\n    \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Rusty Shortsword (status=carried, container=hand_right)\",\n    \"container: pockets (owner=CHAR_ARTIE, contents=[Smartphone (dead), Wallet])\",\n    \"container: hand_right (owner=CHAR_ARTIE, contents=[Rusty Shortsword])\",\n    \"establish Artie's deep-seated frustration with modern life\",\n    \"foreshadow game mechanics through mundane frustrations\",\n    \"tone: comedic and cynical\",\n    \"target_words: 2000\",\n    \"no-recaps\"\n  ],\n  \"location\": \"Office Breakroom\",\n  \"next_action\": \"Artie attempts to physically coerce the vending machine into releasing his snack, leading to a lethal electrical surge.\",\n  \"open_threads\": [],\n  \"scene_end_anchor\": \"This is the first scene of the book.

I checked the floating red bar hovering above its translucent, jiggly head. \n\n[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 3] [HP: 45/45]\n\nForty-five health. At my current Strength of 12, with a base weapon damage of 4-6, I was looking at a nine-hit kill minimum, assuming the RNG gods didn't decide to spit on my shoes today. \n\n\"You know,\" I said, adjusting my grip on the rusted shortsword. \"In most worlds, puddles are for stepping in, not for getting dissolved by.\"\n\nThe slime responded by launching a glob of corrosive mucus. I rolled left, the grass staining my knees.\n\n[Stamina: 88/100]\n\n\"Missed me. Barely. That\u2019s a three-second cooldown on your spit, isn't it?\"\n\nI didn't wait for the confirmation. I lunged. The blade sank into the gelatinous mass with a sound like a heavy boot pulling out of thick mud.\n\n[Critical Hit! -14 HP]\n\n\"There we go. Who needs luck when you have math?\"\n\nThe slime shuddered, its HP bar dipping into the yellow. \n\n[HP: 31/45]\n\n\"One more of those and we can talk about your retirement plan,\" I muttered. My lungs burned slightly, a reminder that my Agility was still garbage. \n\n[Passive Skill Gained: Basic Analysis (Rank F)]\n[Description: You can see basic stats and cooldowns of enemies within 5 meters. You\u2019ve stopped guessing and started counting. Good for you.]\n\n\"Finally,\" I breathed, dodging another glob. \"The ding is coming. I can practically taste the experience points. They taste like copper and bad decisions.\" \n\nI swung again, the numbers popping in the air like neon confetti. This wasn't just a fight; it was a grind. And in this world, the grind was the only thing that kept you from becoming part of the scenery.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"characters\": {\n    \"count\": 5,\n    \"status\": \"READY\",\n    \"updated_at\": \"2026-02-06T01:21:05Z\"\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 1\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"outline\": {\n    \"path\": \"outline/outline.json\"\n  },\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_001/scene_001.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"PLANNED\",\n  \"summary\": {\n    \"chapter_so_far\": [],\n    \"key_facts_ring\": [],\n    \"last_scene\": [],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [],\n    \"pending_story_rollups\": [],\n    \"story_so_far\": []\n  },\n  \"world\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [],\n    \"location\": \"\",\n    \"open_threads\": [],\n    \"recent_facts\": [],\n    \"time\": {}\n  }\n}\n\nOutput (required, no code fences):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n"
