It didn\u2019t just stop; it mocked. The bag of Zesty Ranch Glitch-O\u2019s dangled by a single, microscopic corner of plastic, suspended over the precipice of the delivery chute. \n\nArthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stared through the smudged glass, his reflection staring back with the hollow, haunted eyes of a man who had spent the last six hours staring at Excel spreadsheets that refused to balance. His mousy brown hair, usually just \"unruly,\" had reached a state of chaotic defiance, sticking out in tufts that mirrored his internal state. He was a Junior Analyst, a title that sounded professional but mostly meant he was the person people blamed when the coffee ran out.\n\nThe Leather Wallet felt heavy in his right hand, a useless slab of cowhide that had just surrendered four dollars for a snack it refused to surrender. Artie looked down at the Leather Wallet, then back at the chips. \n\n\"You've got to be kidding me,\" Artie muttered. His voice was raspy, the product of too much recycled office air and not enough social interaction. \n\nHe adjusted the Corporate ID Badge hanging from his neck. The plastic lanyard was frayed, the clip digging into his collarbone. The photo on the badge showed a younger, more optimistic Artie, one who hadn't yet realized that \"upward mobility\" was a myth designed to keep people from jumping out of the third-story windows. \n\nIn his right pocket, his Cracked Smartphone buzzed. Probably another notification from the project manager asking if the Q3 projections were ready. Artie ignored it. The projections weren't ready. The projections would never be ready. The only thing that mattered right now was the bag of chips.\n\nArtie leaned his forehead against the cool glass of the machine. He could see the faint outline of a vending machine scar on his right knuckle, a jagged little reminder of the Great Snickers Standoff of last winter. He had won that fight. He would win this one.\n\n\"Listen, you overpriced box of scrap,\" he whispered. \"I\u2019ve had a very long day. My boss told me my 'synergy' was lacking. My car made a noise this morning that sounded like a cat in a blender. And I just want my Glitch-O's.\"\n\nThe machine didn't respond. It just hummed, a low-frequency vibration that seemed to vibrate his very teeth. \n\nArtie\u2019s patience, a resource that had been dwindling since he\u2019d clocked in at 8:00 AM, finally hit rock bottom. He wasn't just a Junior Analyst anymore. He was a man with a grievance. He was a man who had been pushed too far by a piece of automated retail equipment.\n\nHe shifted the Leather Wallet to his left hand and balled his right hand into a fist. He aimed for the sweet spot\u2014the area just to the left of the keypad where the internal sensors lived. It was a move he called \"Percussive Maintenance,\" a skill he had leveled up through years of dealing with subpar office technology.\n\n*Thump.*\n\nThe machine rattled. The bag of chips swayed. For a glorious second, gravity seemed to remember its job. The corner of the bag slipped a fraction of a millimeter.\n\n\"Yes,\" Artie hissed. \"Come to papa.\"\n\nBut the bag held. It was as if the plastic had bonded with the metal coil on a molecular level. \n\nArtie\u2019s frustration boiled over into a cold, focused rage. He put his Leather Wallet on the small ledge beneath the keypad and gripped the sides of the machine. He began to shake it. The Snack-Master 4000 was heavy, bolted to the floor in a way that suggested the manufacturers knew exactly how people like Artie would react to its failures.\n\n\"Give! Me! My! Chips!\" \n\nHe punctuated each word with a violent shove. Inside, the rows of candy bars and granola snacks danced, a rhythmic jiggling of high-fructose corn syrup. The Glitch-O's remained unmoved.\n\nArtie stopped, panting. His slight build wasn't meant for this kind of physical exertion. He wiped sweat from his pale forehead and looked at the delivery flap at the bottom. It was a heavy metal door, designed to prevent \"shrinkage\"\u2014the corporate term for people stealing snacks.\n\nHe knelt on the linoleum floor, the fluorescent lights overhead flickering in a way that gave him a mounting headache. He pushed the flap open. It resisted, the spring-loaded hinge snapping back against his fingers. \n\n\"Ow! Son of a\u2014\"\n\nHe sucked on his bruised knuckle, the one with the old scar. This was personal now. The machine hadn't just stolen his money; it had drawn blood. \n\nHe reached back in, shoving his arm up into the dark, narrow chute. His fingers brushed against something cold and metallic. He could feel the internal mechanism, the wires and the gears that governed the distribution of snacks. \n\n\"I can feel you,\" he grunted, his shoulder pressed against the metal flap. \"You're right there.\"\n\nHe stretched his arm further, his fingertips grazing the bottom of the chip bag. If he could just hook the plastic, he could pull it down. He ignored the \"Do Not Reach Into Machine\" warning sticker that was currently inches from his nose. That sticker was for people who had something to lose. Artie had nothing but a half-finished spreadsheet and a car that sounded like a blender.\n\nHis hand brushed against a loose wire. \n\nIn that moment, the hum of the machine changed. It went from a low drone to a high-pitched whine. The flickering fluorescent light in the breakroom died, plunging the room into a dim, grey twilight. \n\nArtie felt a tingle in his fingertips. It wasn't the tingle of excitement. It was the tingle of several thousand volts of electricity deciding that his nervous system was a much more efficient path to the ground than the machine's actual wiring.\n\n\"Oh,\" Artie said. It was the only word he had time for.\n\nThe surge hit him like a physical blow. His muscles slammed shut, his hand clenching around the internal wiring of the Snack-Master 4000. He couldn't let go. He couldn't scream. He could only vibrate as the electricity cooked him from the inside out.\n\nHis vision didn't just go dark. It pixelated. \n\nThe breakroom, the vending machine, the Corporate ID Badge hanging from his neck\u2014it all started to dissolve into jagged blocks of color. The smell of ozone and burnt coffee filled his nostrils. He felt his heart skip a beat, then another, then simply stop trying altogether.\n\nThe Leather Wallet slipped from the ledge, hitting the floor with a dull thud. His Cracked Smartphone buzzed one last time in his pocket, a final, ignored request for a Q3 projection that would now remain forever unfinished.\n\nArtie\u2019s last thought wasn't about his family, or his unfulfilled dreams, or the crushing weight of corporate existence. \n\nIt was about the chips. \n\n*I never even got to taste the Zesty Ranch,* he thought.\n\nAnd then, the mundane world of spreadsheets and stuck snacks faded to a perfect, absolute black.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_ARTIE\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"Office Breakroom\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie died from electrocution while fighting a vending machine.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": []\n  },\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie attempted to retrieve a stuck bag of chips from the Snack-Master 4000 in his office breakroom.\",\n      \"After failed percussive maintenance, he reached into the machine's chute and was fatally electrocuted.\",\n      \"The scene ended with Artie's death and the dissolution of the mundane world.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Artie used 'Percussive Maintenance' on the vending machine to no avail.\",\n      \"Artie placed his Leather Wallet on the machine's ledge to free his hands.\",\n      \"Artie reached into the delivery chute to manually grab the chips.\",\n      \"A massive electrical surge from the machine struck Artie.\",\n      \"Artie's Leather Wallet fell to the floor as he collapsed.\",\n      \"Artie died, his vision pixelating as the world faded to black.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"REMOVE: inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Leather Wallet (status=carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"inventory: world -> Leather Wallet (status=dropped, container=floor)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Corporate ID Badge (status=equipped, container=neck)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Cracked Smartphone (status=stowed, container=pocket_right)\",\n      \"milestone: artie_electrocuted = DONE\",\n      \"injury: vending machine scar on right knuckle\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Artie's mundane life ended abruptly in a breakroom accident.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\n          \"item_id\": \"ITEM_ID_BADGE\",\n          \"item_name\": \"Corporate ID Badge\",\n          \"container\": \"neck\",\n          \"status\": \"equipped\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"item_id\": \"ITEM_SMARTPHONE\",\n          \"item_name\": \"Cracked Smartphone\",\n          \"container\": \"pocket_right\",\n          \"status\": \"stowed\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\n          \"container\": \"pocket_right\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n          \"contents\": [\n            \"ITEM_SMARTPHONE\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie's final mundane thought was a regret about untasted chips.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"character_continuity_system_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"set\": {\n        \"stats\": {\n          \"hp\": {\n            \"current\": 0,\n            \"max\": 10\n          }\n        },\n        \"resources\": {\n          \"patience\": {\n            \"current\": 0,\n            \"max\": 100\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"reason\": \"Fatal electrocution by vending machine.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"item_registry_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"item_id\": \"ITEM_WALLET\",\n      \"set\": {\n        \"custodian\": \"world\",\n        \"last_seen\": {\n          \"chapter\": 1,\n          \"scene\": 1,\n          \"location\": \"Office Breakroom floor\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"reason\": \"Dropped during electrocution.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"transfer_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"item_id\": \"ITEM_WALLET\",\n      \"source\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"destination\": \"world\",\n      \"reason\": \"Dropped on floor during fatal electrocution.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"inventory_alignment_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"set\": {\n        \"inventory\": [\n          {\n            \"item\": \"ITEM_ID_BADGE\",\n            \"container\": \"neck\",\n            \"status\": \"equipped\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"item\": \"ITEM_SMARTPHONE\",\n            \"container\": \"pocket_right\",\n            \"status\": \"stowed\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"containers\": [\n          {\n            \"container\": \"pocket_right\",\n            \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n            \"contents\": [\n              \"ITEM_SMARTPHONE\"\n            ]\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      \"reason\": \"Post-death inventory state.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"global_continuity_system_updates\": []\n}",

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nUI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says \"always include\".\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it unless explicitly removing a stale fact with REMOVE and restating the current truth.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v2\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\n\ufeffOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}]\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the

        "content": "# REPAIR\n\nFix the scene based on lint issues.\nSummaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\nTimeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: pre-scene invariants and summary facts are binding unless the Scene Card depicts a change. If this scene changes a durable fact, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value and remove the old entry.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n- must_stay_true removal (mandatory when a durable fact is superseded):\n  - Add \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" in summary_update.must_stay_true.\n  - Place REMOVE lines before the new final invariant.\n  - REMOVE lines also apply to key_facts_ring (purge stale facts from continuity).\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- Inventory posture reconciliation:\n  - If inventory/containers change (held/stowed/container), must_stay_true must be updated to the final posture.\n  - Add REMOVE lines for prior inventory/container invariants before the new final entries.\n  - Use canonical invariant formats:\n    - inventory: CHAR_X -> <item display_name> (status=held|carried|equipped|stowed, container=hand_left|hand_right|<container>)\n    - container: <container> (owner=CHAR_X, contents=[<item display_name>, ...])\nFor held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\nContinuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.\n- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.\n- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.\n- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI gate: only include bracketed UI blocks when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If false, remove or rephrase UI blocks into narrative prose.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or a short parenthetical annotation (e.g., (locked), (Warning: ...)).\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nCanonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\nIf item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for authoritative labels and custody terms.\nUse item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If a durable appearance change occurs in this scene, record it in character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- APPEARANCE_CHECK is required in COMPLIANCE for each cast_present_id (4-8 tokens from atoms/marks).\n\nNaming repairs:\n- If lint flags an item naming issue, fix it with minimal edits.\n- Do not remove humor; simply anchor the item (add display_name near first mention) and ensure custody-change sentences include the display_name.\n- Do not rename item_id or registry fields; only adjust prose wording.\nsummary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\nSTATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nmust_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nIf state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nEnforce scene-card durable constraints: `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\nRespect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`.\n- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):\n  - If timeline_scope != \"present\" OR ontological_scope != \"real\", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).\n  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.\n  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category=\"timeline_override\".\nReturn corrected prose plus a corrected state_patch JSON block.\n\nOutput format (required, no code fences, no commentary):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n\nAPPEARANCE_CHECK:\n- CHAR_ID: <4-8 tokens from atoms/marks>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects.

Never use null.\n    - INVALID: \"custodian\": null\n    - VALID: \"custodian\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\" or \"world\"\n  - owner_scope must be \"character\" or \"world\" and must match the custodian scope.\n  - plot_device_updates: set must include name, custody_scope, custody_ref, activation_state, linked_threads, constraints, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n- Transfer vs registry conflict rule (must follow):\n  - If you create a NEW item in item_registry_updates with final custodian already set (e.g., CHAR_ARTIE), DO NOT emit transfer_updates for that item.\n  - If you emit transfer_updates for a NEW item, the registry entry must start with custodian=\"world\" and then transfer to the character.\n  - expected_before must match the registry

`updates` field.\n  - inventory_alignment_updates[*].set MUST be an object (not a list).\n    - INVALID: \"set\": []\n    - VALID:   \"set\": {\"inventory\": [...], \"containers\": [...]}\n- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.\n- If you mutate durable state, do not leave the same mutation only in prose.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n- appearance_updates: when a durable appearance change happens, include appearance_updates on the relevant character_updates entry.\n  - appearance_updates MUST be an object, not an array.\n    - INVALID: \"appearance_updates\": [{\"set\": {...}, \"reason\": \"...\"}]\n    - VALID: \"appearance_updates\": {\"set\": {\"marks_add\": [{\"name\": \"Singed

It didn\u2019t just stop; it mocked. The bag of Zesty Ranch Glitch-O\u2019s dangled by a single, microscopic corner of plastic, suspended over the precipice of the delivery chute. \n\nArthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stared through the smudged glass, his reflection staring back with the hollow, haunted eyes of a man who had spent the last six hours staring at Excel spreadsheets that refused to balance. His mousy brown hair, usually just \"unruly,\" had reached a state of chaotic defiance, sticking out in tufts that mirrored his internal state. He was a Junior Analyst, a title that sounded professional but mostly meant he was the person people blamed when the coffee ran out.\n\nThe Leather Wallet felt heavy in his right hand, a useless slab of cowhide that had just surrendered four dollars for a snack it refused to surrender. Artie looked down at the wallet, then back at the chips. \n\n\"You've got to be kidding me,\" Artie muttered. His voice was raspy, the product of too much recycled office air and not enough social interaction. \n\nHe adjusted the Corporate ID Badge hanging from his neck. The plastic lanyard was frayed, the clip digging into his collarbone. The photo on the badge showed a younger, more optimistic Artie, one who hadn't yet realized that \"upward mobility\" was a myth designed to keep people from jumping out of the third-story windows. \n\nIn his right pocket, his Cracked Smartphone buzzed. Probably another notification from the project manager asking if the Q3 projections were ready. Artie ignored it. The projections weren't ready. The projections would never be ready. The only thing that mattered right now was the bag of chips.\n\nArtie leaned his forehead against the cool glass of the machine. He could see the faint outline of a vending machine scar on his right knuckle, a jagged little reminder of the Great Snickers Standoff of last winter. He had won that fight. He would win this one.\n\n\"Listen, you overpriced box of scrap,\" he whispered. \"I\u2019ve had a very long day. My boss told me my 'synergy' was lacking. My car made a noise this morning that sounded like a cat in a blender. And I just want my Glitch-O's.\"\n\nThe machine didn't respond. It just hummed, a low-frequency vibration that seemed to vibrate his very teeth. \n\nArtie\u2019s patience, a resource that had been dwindling since he\u2019d clocked in at 8:00 AM, finally hit rock bottom. He wasn't just a Junior Analyst anymore. He was a man with a grievance. He was a man who had been pushed too far by a piece of automated retail equipment.\n\nHe shifted the Leather Wallet to his left hand and balled his right hand into a fist. He aimed for the sweet spot\u2014the area just to the left of the keypad where the internal sensors lived. It was a move he called \"Percussive Maintenance,\" a skill he had leveled up through years of dealing with subpar office technology.\n\n*Thump.*\n\nThe machine rattled. The bag of chips swayed. For a glorious second, gravity seemed to remember its job. The corner of the bag slipped a fraction of a millimeter.\n\n\"Yes,\" Artie hissed. \"Come to papa.\"\n\nBut the bag held. It was as if the plastic had bonded with the metal coil on a molecular level. \n\nArtie\u2019s frustration boiled over into a cold, focused rage. He put his wallet on the small ledge beneath the keypad and gripped the sides of the machine. He began to shake it. The Snack-Master 4000 was heavy, bolted to the floor in a way that suggested the manufacturers knew exactly how people like Artie would react to its failures.\n\n\"Give! Me! My! Chips!\" \n\nHe punctuated each word with a violent shove. Inside, the rows of candy bars and granola snacks danced, a rhythmic jiggling of high-fructose corn syrup. The Glitch-O's remained unmoved.\n\nArtie stopped, panting. His slight build wasn't meant for this kind of physical exertion. He wiped sweat from his pale forehead and looked at the delivery flap at the bottom. It was a heavy metal door, designed to prevent \"shrinkage\"\u2014the corporate term for people stealing snacks.\n\nHe knelt on the linoleum floor, the fluorescent lights overhead flickering in a way that gave him a mounting headache. He pushed the flap open. It resisted, the spring-loaded hinge snapping back against his fingers. \n\n\"Ow! Son of a\u2014\"\n\nHe sucked on his bruised knuckle, the one with the old scar. This was personal now. The machine hadn't just stolen his money; it had drawn blood. \n\nHe reached back in, shoving his arm up into the dark, narrow chute. His fingers brushed against something cold and metallic. He could feel the internal mechanism, the wires and the gears that governed the distribution of snacks. \n\n\"I can feel you,\" he grunted, his shoulder pressed against the metal flap. \"You're right there.\"\n\nHe stretched his arm further, his fingertips grazing the bottom of the chip bag. If he could just hook the plastic, he could pull it down. He ignored the \"Do Not Reach Into Machine\" warning sticker that was currently inches from his nose. That sticker was for people who had something to lose. Artie had nothing but a half-finished spreadsheet and a car that sounded like a blender.\n\nHis hand brushed against a loose wire. \n\nIn that moment, the hum of the machine changed. It went from a low drone to a high-pitched whine. The flickering fluorescent light in the breakroom died, plunging the room into a dim, grey twilight. \n\nArtie felt a tingle in his fingertips. It wasn't the tingle of excitement. It was the tingle of several thousand volts of electricity deciding that his nervous system was a much more efficient path to the ground than the machine's actual wiring.\n\n\"Oh,\" Artie said. It was the only word he had time for.\n\nThe surge hit him like a physical blow. His muscles slammed shut, his hand clenching around the internal wiring of the Snack-Master 4000. He couldn't let go. He couldn't scream. He could only vibrate as the electricity cooked him from the inside out.\n\nHis vision didn't just go dark. It pixelated. \n\nThe breakroom, the vending machine, the Corporate ID Badge hanging from his neck\u2014it all started to dissolve into jagged blocks of color. The smell of ozone and burnt coffee filled his nostrils. He felt his heart skip a beat, then another, then simply stop trying altogether.\n\nThe Leather Wallet slipped from the ledge, hitting the floor with a dull thud. His Cracked Smartphone buzzed one last time in his pocket, a final, ignored request for a Q3 projection that would now remain forever unfinished.\n\nArtie\u2019s last thought wasn't about his family, or his unfulfilled dreams, or the crushing weight of corporate existence. \n\nIt was about the chips. \n\n*I never even got to taste the Zesty Ranch,* he thought.\n\nAnd then, the mundane world of spreadsheets and stuck snacks faded to a perfect, absolute black.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n
