PROSE:
The descent from the foothills was a slow-motion catastrophe of sliding obsidian and grinding bone. Kaelen didn't walk into the Silver Valley so much as he negotiated a desperate truce with the wreckage of it. Every time his boots struck the slope, the earth yielded not with the soft give of mountain soil, but with the brittle, high-pitched scream of shattering glass. The star had not simply hit the ground; it had rewritten the valley’s chemistry. Where there had once been a carpet of alpine grass and the silver-leafed aspens that gave the place its name, there was now a jagged, translucent sea. The impact had flash-melted the silica in the soil, freezing the shockwave into a crown of solidified glass that rippled outward in concentric circles of bruised violet and sickly amber.

Kaelen’s left arm throbbed with a cold, rhythmic heat that had nothing to do with the freezing mountain air. The Starwrought Oath was not a metaphor or a spiritual bond; it was a physical length of star-forged pewter, a celestial filament woven directly into the marrow of his radius bone. Now, that physical anchor was a jagged ruin. Inside the bone, the filament had snapped into a dozen dark splinters that ground against his nerves with every movement. It felt as if a hair-thin wire of frozen lead was being twisted by a pair of rusted pliers. Every shift of his weight, every frantic grab at a glass-slick ledge for balance, sent a fresh surge of frost-burn through his shoulder.

He paused, his breath hitching in lungs that felt as though they had been scrubbed with lye. The air here was wrong. It tasted of ozone and old, wet copper, thick enough to coat the tongue. He looked up at the High Spire, a dark needle silhouetted against the star-choked sky, tilting at an impossible angle. It looked fragile, a child’s toy discarded on a shelf of broken mirrors. There was no going back. The wards were gone, and the silence from the Spire was the silence of a tomb.

He turned his gaze back to the center of the crater. The light there was different—not the reflected shimmer of the stars above, but a deep, internal throb. It beat like a heart, a low-frequency vibration that he felt in his teeth more than he heard in his ears. Thump-hiss. Thump-hiss.

Kaelen stepped onto the floor of the valley proper. The glass here was razor-edged, the shards standing up like the teeth of a buried beast. He moved with a hunter’s caution, placing his feet in the hollows between the ridges. Even so, the hem of his heavy wool cloak caught on a protrusion, the fabric parting with a clean, surgical snip. He didn't stop to check the damage. The cold in his arm was deepening, turning from an ache into a numbing void that threatened to lock his fingers into a permanent claw.

"Hold together," he hissed, his voice a dry rasp. He wasn't sure if he was talking to himself or the fractured metal in his bone.

As he neared the impact point, the transparency of the glass changed. It became opaque, clouded with swirls of dark matter that looked like ink dropped into clear water. The rhythmic beat grew louder, a physical pressure that seemed to push against his chest, trying to sync his own heart to its alien tempo. The ground began to slope upward again, forming a central mound where the star had finally come to rest. Here, the glass hadn't just shattered; it had been sculpted by the heat into grotesque, flowering shapes. Petals of translucent violet stone curved upward, ten feet tall, forming a jagged chalice around the impact site.

Kaelen climbed. He used his right hand to haul himself up, his boots slipping on the vitreous surface. Twice, he slid back, the glass slicing through the tough leather of his gloves. He ignored the warm wetness of blood; in this cold, it would tack his skin to the stone soon enough. He reached the rim of the central chalice and looked down.

The crater floor was a smooth, polished bowl of deep violet light. At its center lay the shard. It wasn't large—perhaps the size of a man’s head—but it possessed a density that seemed to warp the very space around it. It wasn't solid, not exactly. It looked like a knot of solidified smoke, a crystalline lattice that shifted and roiled internally. A bruised, violet radiance spilled from its core, casting long, dancing shadows against the walls of the glass bowl.

And it was beating.

The rhythm was undeniable now. With every pulse of light, the shard expanded and contracted by a fraction of a millimeter. The sound it made was the sound of a heavy door closing in a deep cellar—a dull, resonant thud that vibrated through the glass beneath Kaelen’s feet. He felt a sudden, violent spasm in his left wrist. The physical filament of the Oath reacted to the shard’s proximity like a compass needle near a lightning strike. The pewter thread beneath his skin flared with a dull, dying light, visible through the pale flesh of his arm. The pain was blinding, a white-hot spike driven through the center of his palm.

Kaelen collapsed to his knees, clutching his arm. He gasped for air, but the atmosphere inside the bowl was thin and scorched. His vision swam. For a moment, he wasn't in the Silver Valley. He was back in the High Spire, standing before the Great Ward-Ring, watching the iron turn to liquid as the sky fell. He saw the face of Commander Varkas, eyes wide with a reflected violet fire, his mouth open in a silent scream as the void-frost took him.

He blinked, shaking his head. The hallucination receded, leaving only the cold and the thumping heart of the star. It’s calling, he realized. Not to the world. To the Oath.

The Starwrought Oath wasn't just a vow; it was a physical tether. For centuries, his order had been the anchors, the points of contact between the celestial and the terrestrial. They held the stars in their places, and in return, they were granted the light to hold back the dark. But the tether was broken. The anchor was dragging.

He forced himself to stand. His legs felt like lead, and his left arm was entirely dead weight now, hanging uselessly at his side. He began the final descent into the bowl. The air grew warmer as he approached the shard, but it was an uncomfortable, humid heat—the heat of a fever. The smell of copper intensified, mixed now with something sweet and cloying, like rotting lilies.

He stopped a few feet from the object. Up close, the shard was terrifyingly beautiful. The internal smoke was composed of millions of tiny, needle-like structures, constantly rearranging themselves. It was a machine of pure geometry, a piece of a world that didn't obey the laws of his own. Kaelen reached out with his right hand. His fingers trembled. He knew the cost of touching raw star-stuff without a stable Oath to buffer the transition. It would burn. It would hollow him out. It might turn his blood to glass.

But the Spire was falling, the Order was dead, and the shadow-forms were already prowling the edges of the valley. This shard was the only thing left that had the weight to pull him out of the ruins.

"By the Weaver’s hand," he whispered, invoking a god he no longer believed in.

He lunged forward and closed his hand around the shard. The world vanished in a scream of violet light. The impact was not physical, but metaphysical. It felt as if his entire nervous system had been plugged into a sun. The fractured Oath in his arm didn't just throb; it shrieked. The pewter filament buckled, the splinters of his broken vow driven deep into his very soul. He couldn't breathe. He couldn't scream. He was a vessel being filled with a pressure that exceeded his volume.

The shard’s heartbeat became his own. Thump-hiss. Thump-hiss.

Images flickered through his mind at a speed that defied comprehension: stars collapsing into black pearls, silver webs stretching across the void, a great, multi-eyed beast watching from the dark between the constellations. He felt the loneliness of the shard—a fragment of a dying consciousness, reaching out for anything to hold onto.

Kaelen’s grip tightened. He refused to let go. He felt the skin of his palm blistering, the scent of his own scorched flesh rising in the air, but he forced his will into the shard. He used the jagged remains of his Oath as a hook, snagging the alien energy and pulling it into the vacuum of his own fractured magic. The violet light began to recede, drawing inward, back into the crystalline lattice. The heat faded, replaced by a deep, resonant hum that settled into his bones.

Kaelen fell back onto the glass, gasping, his chest heaving. He was drenched in sweat despite the freezing night. He looked down at his right hand. The shard was silent now, its surface dark and matte like charcoal, but he could still feel the pulse inside it—a faint, rhythmic tremor. It was bound to him.

His left arm was a map of ruin. The skin over the radius bone was bruised a deep, necrotic purple, and the pewter filament was no longer a single line. It had branched out, a web of dark, metallic veins spreading toward his elbow and his thumb. The pain had settled into a dull, permanent throb, a constant reminder of the price he had paid.

But he had it. He had the heart of the star.

In the distance, beyond the rim of the crater, a long, low howl echoed through the valley. It wasn't the sound of a wolf. It was a sound of empty spaces and hungry shadows. Kaelen tucked the shard into the heavy leather satchel at his hip, his movements jerky and uncoordinated. He used his good hand to push himself up, his eyes scanning the jagged horizon of the glass crown. The shadow-forms were coming, drawn to the light he had just extinguished.

He looked once more at the High Spire, now a broken silhouette against a sky that felt heavier than it had an hour ago. He was no longer a watchman. He was a thief, a fugitive, and perhaps the last living fragment of a broken world. He turned toward the south, toward the only path that didn't lead back to the ruins, and began the long, agonizing trek out of the glass. The shard in his bag gave a single, heavy thud against his thigh, a heartbeat in the dark.
