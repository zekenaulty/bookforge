  "text": "PROSE:\n\nThe first shadow didn\u2019t emerge so much as it curdled out of the air. It spilled from the lip of the crater, a viscous smear of absolute black that swallowed the reflected violet light of the shard. Kaelen\u2019s breath hitched, the air in his lungs suddenly tasting of wet ash and old graves. He didn't have time to adjust his grip on the pulsing star-matter before the second form manifested, a jagged silhouette that lacked a face but possessed a terrifying, singular intent.\n\nA spike of agony erupted from his ribs. The Starwrought Oath, usually a dormant lattice of silver etched into his skin, burned with the heat of a stoked forge. He felt the skin blister beneath his tunic. The mark wasn't just reacting; it was screaming in sympathetic resonance with the shard. Every pulse of violet light from the stone sent a corresponding jolt of white-hot needles through his side, threatening to buckle his knees.\n\nHe dropped the shard into the heavy leather satchel at his hip, but the distance did nothing to dampen the connection. The first shadow-form lunged. It didn't run; it elongated, a ribbon of void-matter snapping across the fractured sky-glass. Kaelen threw himself to the left, his boots skidding on the slick, crystalline surface. He drew his short-blade, the steel feeling impossibly cold against his palm, a sharp contrast to the fire in his chest.\n\nThe shadow struck the glass where he had been standing a heartbeat before. The sky-glass didn't shatter; it turned gray, the vibrant translucent blue leaching away as if the entity had drank the very history of the stone. \n\n\"Back,\" Kaelen wheezed, the word more a gasp of pain than a command. \n\nThe shadows ignored him. Three more drifted over the rim, their edges flickering like guttering candles. They were drawn to the shard, or perhaps to the oath-mark that now bled a faint, sickly purple light through the weave of his shirt. He swung the blade in a wide arc, catching the lead shadow across its midsection. There was no resistance, no spray of blood\u2014only the sensation of cutting through thick, freezing fog. \n\nThe entity recoiled, a low hiss vibrating through the glass beneath Kaelen\u2019s feet. The sound wasn't auditory; it was a rhythmic grinding that set his teeth on edge. The oath-mark flared again, a violent contraction that pulled his torso tight and forced him to his knees. He coughed, the metallic tang of blood coating his tongue. \n\nThe shadows sensed the weakness. They converged, a ring of predatory absences closing the distance. Kaelen jammed the hilt of his blade into the glass to steady himself, his knuckles white. The violet light in his satchel grew frantic, strobing in time with his hammering heart. \n\n\"Not today,\" he snarled, though the defiance felt hollow against the crushing weight of the void-forms. \n\nAs the closest shadow reached out a limb that resembled a skeletal hand, the oath-mark on Kaelen\u2019s ribs underwent a terrifying transformation. The bruised purple deepened to a black so intense it seemed to pull the surrounding light into his body. The pain transitioned from heat to a numbing, soul-deep frost. A shockwave of kinetic force erupted from his chest, a radial burst of starlight and shadow that caught the entities mid-stride.\n\nThe impact sent Kaelen sprawling backward. His head cracked against a shelf of sky-glass, sending stars dancing across his vision that had nothing to do with the fallen sky. He scrambled for purchase, his fingers raw and bleeding where they caught on the sharp edges of the crater. \n\nThe shadow-forms didn't vanish. They began to unravel. The shockwave had disrupted their cohesion, turning their solid-void forms into tattered ribbons of smoke. They thrashed, their silent screams vibrating through Kaelen\u2019s marrow. One by one, they were pulled downward\u2014not into the air, but into the sky-glass itself. The crystalline floor of the crater acted like a sponge, the dark smoke swirling into the fractures and veins of the glass, staining the once-clear material with oily, permanent streaks of charcoal.\n\nKaelen lay flat on his back, his chest heaving. Every breath was a jagged razor in his throat. He looked down at his side. His tunic was scorched, a ragged hole burned through the fabric where the oath-mark sat. The skin beneath was a ruin of weeping blisters and dark, interlacing lines that looked less like a mark and more like a map of a dying star. \n\nThe silence that followed was heavier than the noise of the fight. The violet glow from his satchel had dimmed to a rhythmic, low thrum, as if the shard were sated or exhausted. \n\nHe tried to move his left arm, but a sharp, biting pain in his shoulder signaled a deep laceration he hadn't felt in the heat of the moment. The shadow-forms had left their mark in more ways than one. The sky-glass beneath him felt dead, the resonance of the High Spire anchor truly extinguished, replaced by the cold, lingering presence of the things that had tried to claim the shard.\n\nHe was alive, but the cost was etched into his flesh. He reached into the satchel, his fingers brushing the cold surface of the shard. It was still there. It was still his burden. For now. \n\nKaelen rolled onto his side, his vision swimming. He needed to move. The crater was no longer a place of discovery; it was a tomb, and the things buried in the glass weren't necessarily dead. They were just waiting.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_kaelen\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"The Impact Crater (High Spire Valley)\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Kaelen defended the shard against shadow-forms that emerged from the crater's edge.\",\n      \"The shadow-forms were dissipated by a violent burst of energy from Kaelen's oath-mark.\",\n      \"The remnants of the shadow-forms have been absorbed into the sky-glass of the crater, staining it black.\",\n      \"Kaelen has sustained serious physical injuries, including a scorched chest and a deep shoulder laceration.\",\n      \"The oath-mark has shifted from bruised purple to a deep, light-eating black.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_oath_binding\",\n      \"THREAD_starfall_corruption\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"cursor_advance\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 5\n  }\n}",

Your writing is characterized by a tight, limited third-person perspective that never breaks into omniscient narration. You must maintain strict continuity, ensuring that characters utilize their full range of established skills and knowledge. Do not use 'As you know' dialogue or provide summaries of previous events. When a scene begins, drop the reader directly into the character's current sensory experience. Avoid clich\u00e9s in descriptions; instead of 'cold as ice,' describe the 'brittle, biting snap of air that makes the lungs ache.' Ensure all plot payoffs are seeded with subtle clues in earlier movements. Magic and high-fantasy elements must have clear costs and logical consistency.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\n",

Every step through the knee-deep peat required a deliberate shift of weight, a calculated gamble against the suction of the black mud. To rush was to sink; to hesitate was to let the stinging gnats find the gaps in the leather greaves.\n\nThe silver needle of the compass didn\u2019t spin; it shuddered, vibrating with a frequency that numbed the thumb pressing against the casing. This wasn't the erratic jitter of a magnetic anomaly, but the rhythmic, heavy thrum of a tethered ley-line. It pulled at the marrow, a dull ache in the long bones that signaled the proximity of a ruptured seal. The price of such proximity was always paid in blood-sugar and breath; the lungs felt scorched, as if the very oxygen had been thinned by the invisible pressure.\n\nA jagged obsidian shard protruded from a stump of petrified oak. It didn't just sit in the light; it seemed to drink it, casting a shadow that fell toward the sun rather than away. Touching it would be a mistake\u2014the last time a finger had brushed a similar fracture, the skin had turned the color of a bruised plum and stayed cold for a week. Instead, the focus remained on the tension of the wire stretched across the path, nearly invisible against the gray mist. It was set at mid-thigh height, weighted with a lead sinker to ensure it wouldn't flutter in the wind.

The world didn't offer warnings, only consequences recorded in the stiffness of joints and the steady, rhythmic thud of a heart working too hard against a thinning atmosphere.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 4\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"outline\": {\n    \"path\": \"outline/outline.json\"\n  },\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_001/scene_004.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"DRAFTING\",\n  \"world\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_kaelen\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"The Impact Crater (High Spire Valley)\",\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_oath_binding\",\n      \"THREAD_starfall_corruption\"\n    ],\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Kaelen has retrieved the pulsing violet shard from the impact site.\",\n      \"The Starwrought Oath on Kaelen's ribs has reacted to the shard, turning from silver to a bruised purple.\",\n      \"The physical contact with the shard has initiated a direct resonance between the star-matter and Kaelen's oath-binding.\",\n      \"The High Spire's sky-glass anchor is confirmed as completely destroyed.\"\n    ],\n    \"time\": {}\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n"
