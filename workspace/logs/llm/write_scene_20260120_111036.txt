The bridge didn't just lean; it groaned with the slow, tectonic agony of granite being forced into a geometry it wasn't carved for. Kaelen pressed his chest against the cold stone of the transit-arch, his boots skidding on a fine dusting of pulverized mortar. Gravity pulled him toward the eastern precipice, where the clouds were stained a bruised, sickly violet. The High Spire, once the vertical axis of the world’s stability, was now a falling needle frozen in mid-descent.

Inside his ribs, his heart no longer belonged to him. It beat with a double-time cadence—*thump-hiss, thump-hiss*—an echo of the weight in his satchel. Every pulse sent a needle of cold fire down his right arm, where the black, starwrought scarring had begun to knit itself into his very muscle. The skin there was no longer flesh; it was a map of obsidian veins, slick and hard as beetle-chitin, pulsing in time with the shard. 

He reached the end of the bridge and hauled himself onto the main terrace. The air here was thick with the scent of scorched copper and something sweeter, like rotting fruit. It made his lungs ache, a dry, brittle sensation that forced him to take shallow, guarded breaths. 

"Varkas!" he shouted, but the wind swallowed the name. 

The main gates of the High Spire were gone. Not broken or forced, but unmade. The heavy ironwood had been reduced to a fine gray ash that swirled in the draft, and the stone lintel was weeping a viscous, violet fluid. Kaelen stepped over the threshold, his hand instinctively moving to the hilt of his blade, only to find his fingers stiff and clumsy. The starwrought scarring on his arm didn't just hurt; it felt heavy, as if the limb were being replaced by lead.

The interior of the Spire was a graveyard of silence. The great hall, which usually hummed with the low-frequency resonance of the protective wards, was hollow. The wards hadn't just failed; they had been inverted. The silver filigree that once lined the walls was now black and jagged, protruding from the masonry like the teeth of a saw. 

He moved toward the central staircase, his shadow stretching long and distorted across the floor. The tilt of the building was more pronounced here. Every dozen steps, the floor would lurch, a groan of stressed stone echoing up from the foundations. The Spire was dying, its soul being eaten by the very thing it was built to watch.

He passed the barracks. The doors were open. He didn't look inside. He couldn't. The smell of ozone was too strong there, and the silence too heavy. He kept his eyes on the path ahead, his boots clicking rhythmically against the stone, a lonely counterpoint to the *thump-hiss* in his chest.

As he ascended toward the Inner Sanctum, the violet light grew more intense. It didn't come from any lamp or window; it bled from the air itself, a nebulous haze that made the edges of the world seem soft and frayed. The stone steps under his feet felt spongy, as if the molecular bond of the granite was dissolving.

He reached the landing of the third floor and stopped. A trail of the violet fluid—the 'Star-Bleed'—ran down the center of the hallway, steaming slightly. It led directly to the Commander’s private chambers.

"Commander?" Kaelen’s voice was a rasp. The cold in his arm was spreading, a numbing frost that threatened to lock his elbow. He gripped his right wrist with his left hand, forcing the limb to move. 

The door to the Inner Sanctum was ajar. It hung on a single hinge, the wood charred and weeping. Kaelen shouldered it open, the screech of metal on stone sounding like a dying bird.

The room beyond was a chaotic tableau of scholarship and ruin. Varkas’s maps, centuries of star-charts and planetary alignments, were scattered across the floor, their parchment curling and blackening as if exposed to an invisible flame. The great orrery in the center of the room—a masterpiece of brass and celestial glass—was shattered. Its gears were scattered like copper coins, and the central sun-globe was missing.

In the center of the ruin sat Commander Varkas.

He was slumped in his high-backed chair, his back to the door. He didn't turn when Kaelen entered. He didn't move at all, save for the rhythmic rise and fall of his shoulders. 

"Commander, the Spire is falling," Kaelen said, his voice gaining a desperate edge. "The wards are gone. I have the shard. We have to move."

Varkas didn't answer. Instead, he let out a sound—a low, melodic hum that vibrated in Kaelen’s marrow. It was the same frequency as the shard in the satchel. 

Kaelen walked around the chair, his heart hammering against his ribs. "Varkas, look at me."

He reached out with his left hand and turned the chair. 

The man who had been Commander Varkas was gone. In his place was a vessel of the starfall. Varkas’s eyes were no longer white and iris; they were twin pools of rotating violet light, deep and vast as the void itself. His skin had been translucent, stretched thin over bones that had turned the color of bruised pewter. 

But it was the Commander's chest that made Kaelen recoil. 

The front of Varkas’s tunic had been torn away. Where his heart should have been, a jagged cluster of star-glass had erupted from the ribcage. It pulsed with a rhythmic, alien beat, and from its center, thin filaments of violet energy crawled up Varkas’s neck like a web of glowing veins. 

"Kaelen," Varkas whispered. The voice didn't come from his throat; it seemed to vibrate out of the very air between them. It was a hollow, echoing sound, stripped of all humanity. "The oath... is a lie."

Varkas raised a hand. It was no longer a hand. The fingers had elongated, the tips sharpening into translucent needles of glass. He reached toward Kaelen, his movements jerky and unnatural, like a marionette being pulled by invisible, frantic strings. 

"The stars aren't watching us, Kaelen," Varkas said, a single tear of violet fluid tracing a path down his cheek. "They are waiting for us."

Kaelen stepped back, his boot catching on a fallen brass gear. The shard in his satchel let out a violent *thump-hiss*, and the black scarring on his arm flared with a blinding, frigid light. The two resonances—the one in Kaelen and the one in the Commander—clashed in the small room, shattering the remaining glass in the orrery.

"Commander, please," Kaelen choked out, the scorched-copper smell becoming unbearable. 

Varkas stood up. He was taller than he should have been, his spine elongating with the sound of snapping bone. The star-glass in his chest brightened, casting long, jagged shadows against the tilting walls of the sanctum. 

"The Order was a cage," Varkas said, his violet eyes locking onto Kaelen’s. "And the star... is the key."

He took a step forward, the floorboards splintering under his weight. The High Spire gave a massive, final groan, the tilt increasing until the furniture began to slide toward the eastern wall. Kaelen grabbed a bookshelf to steady himself, his eyes never leaving the horror that had been his mentor. 

The corruption wasn't just physical; it was an erasure. Varkas was being hollowed out, replaced by the very essence they had sworn their lives to contain. 

"I have the maps," Kaelen said, his voice trembling. "I have the shard. I can fix this."

Varkas smiled, a terrifying expression that split his translucent skin. "You can't fix a sunrise, Kaelen. You can only witness it."

The Commander raised his glass-tipped hand, and the violet light in the room intensified until it was all Kaelen could see. The *thump-hiss* in his chest reached a deafening crescendo, a scream of alien energy that threatened to tear his heart in two. 

The High Spire screamed with him, a chorus of stone and metal reaching its breaking point.
