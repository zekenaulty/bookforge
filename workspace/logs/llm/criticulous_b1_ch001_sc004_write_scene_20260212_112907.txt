PROSE:

The rock walls of the crevice were damp, slick with a moss that smelled like old basement and forgotten dreams. Artie backed up until his shoulder blades hit the cold, unforgiving stone. He was trapped. There was no clever exit, no hidden tunnel, just a lanky office worker in a tattered shirt facing down a translucent wobbling nightmare.

The Lesser Puddle Slime didn't look like much. It was a grapefruit-sized blob of neon-blue jelly that quivered with every sluggish "schlorp" it made across the dirt. But to Artie, it was the Grim Reaper in a semi-solid state.

[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 1] [HP: 10/10]

"Fizz, a little help here?" Artie yelled at the empty air, his voice cracking. "I’m about to be digested by a cleaning product!"

A holographic window flickered into existence, hovering just out of reach. Fizz’s face, looking bored and slightly pixelated, stared back at him. She was holding a book titled *The Noob's Guide to Not Dying*.

"Checking the manual, Artie," Fizz said, her voice echoing in his head. "Ah, here it is. Section four, subsection B: 'Combat for the Chronically Incompetent.' It says: 'Step 1: Try hitting it. Step 2: Try not being where the monster is. Step 3: If steps 1 and 2 fail, consider a career in being loot.'"

"That is the least helpful thing anyone has ever said to me!" Artie ducked as the slime lunged.

The blue blob launched itself with surprising velocity. Artie scrambled to the side, his sneakers slipping on the loose shale. He felt the cold, acidic spray of the slime’s wake brush against his arm.

[HP: 1/1] (Warning: Critical Condition)

"One touch! That's all it takes!" Artie hissed. He balled his fist, his knuckles white. "Okay. Math. I have a 100% crit rate. If I hit this thing, it’s over."

He swung a desperate right hook at the center of the jelly. His fist passed through the top layer of the slime, but his aim was off, skewed by the sheer terror of his 1 HP existence.

[Attack Result: Miss]

"Miss? How do you miss a target that moves at the speed of a tectonic plate?" Artie roared.

"The Guide says your Accuracy stat is currently 'Optimistic,'" Fizz’s voice chimed in. "Maybe try closing your eyes? It might help the System feel sorry for you."

Artie didn't close his eyes. He lunged again, trying to stomp on the quivering mass. His foot hit the ground an inch to the left of the blue core.

[Attack Result: Miss]

The slime retracted, its surface tension tightening. It was preparing for another jump. Artie could see the internal pressure building, the blue jelly turning a darker, more aggressive shade of sapphire.

"Come on, Artie. Focus. You were the king of the spreadsheets. You can do this."

He jabbed forward, a quick, sharp strike aimed right at the slime's center. It connected. He felt the resistance of the jelly, the squelch of impact.

[Critical Hit! - 0 Damage]
[Note: Glitched: Crit-Only - Non-critical components of a glitched strike result in 0 base damage.]

Artie stared at the floating zero. "Zero? I hit it! I felt it! I heard the squelch!"

"Oh, right," Fizz said, flipping a page in her book. "I forgot to mention the glitch interaction. Since your build is technically 'broken,' the System sometimes forgets how to carry the one. You landed a critical hit, but because your base damage is so low and your accuracy is trash, the math rounded down to 'Why are you even trying?'"

"I hate this game," Artie muttered. He tried a double-handed overhead smash, bringing his fists down like a hammer. The slime simply wobbled out of the way, leaving Artie to smash his hands into the dirt.

[Attack Result: Miss]

"That’s four," Fizz noted, her tone remarkably cheerful. "Statistically speaking, you're due for a win. Or a burial. The odds are about fifty-fifty."

The slime lunged again, this time aiming for Artie’s face. He threw himself onto his back, the blue blob sailing over him and slamming into the rock wall with a wet *thwack*. It slid down the stone, leaving a trail of glowing blue slime that hissed as it ate into the rock.

Artie scrambled to his feet, his breath coming in ragged gasps. He was cornered, exhausted, and one mistake away from deletion. He looked at the slime as it regrouped, its little jelly body vibrating with a low, humming sound.

"This is it," Artie whispered. "No more spreadsheets. No more vending machines. Just me and the blob."

He didn't just swing this time. He felt something shift in the air around him. The 'Statistical Anomaly' title above his head began to pulse with a sickly, flickering light. The System wasn't just calculating; it was straining. The 100% Crit Rate wasn't just a stat anymore; it was a demand.

He stepped forward, his movements suddenly fluid, driven by the sheer absurdity of his situation. He swung a punch, not at the slime, but through the very space the slime occupied.

[Attack Result: Miss]

"Five!" Artie screamed, but he didn't stop. He felt a surge of heat in his chest, a digital fever that burned through his veins.

The slime launched itself one final time, a blue bullet of certain death. Artie didn't dodge. He didn't blink. He reached out and caught the slime mid-air with his bare hand.

The moment his skin touched the jelly, the world stopped. The colors inverted. The sound of the wind died, replaced by the screech of a thousand dial-up modems screaming in unison.

[CRITICAL HIT!]
[Calculating Multiplier...]
[Error: Overflow detected.]
[Applying 'Statistical Anomaly' Correction...]
[SUPER-MEGA-ULTRA-CRIT!]

A pillar of white-hot light erupted from Artie’s fist. It wasn't just damage; it was a deletion event. The Lesser Puddle Slime didn't just die; it ceased to have ever existed. The light expanded, a blinding sphere of geometric fury that tore through the back of the crevice.

The rock walls turned to gray dust, then to nothingness. The trees behind the crevice, ancient oaks that had stood for centuries, were vaporized in a clean, circular arc that stretched a hundred yards into the forest. The ground itself was scoured bare, leaving a smooth, glass-like trench where the tutorial zone used to be.

Artie stood in the center of the devastation, his hand still extended, smoking slightly. The silence that followed was absolute.

[Combat Log: Artie Penhaligon dealt 99,999,999 True Damage to Lesser Puddle Slime.]
[Lesser Puddle Slime has been removed from the local directory.]
[Environment has been 'Optimized'.]

Fizz’s holographic window was flickering wildly, her face replaced by a series of rapidly scrolling error codes.

"Artie?" her voice came through, distorted and tinny. "I think... I think you broke the tutorial."

Artie looked down at his hand, then at the mile-long scar he’d just carved into the world.

"Does this mean I get the loot?"

[System Notification]
[Enemy Defeated: Lesser Puddle Slime (Lvl 1)]
[Experience Gained: 50 (Glitched Multiplier Applied: x100)]
[Experience Gained: 5,000]

[LEVEL UP!]
[LEVEL UP!]
[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon is now Level 2!]

[Stat Points Gained: 5]
[Skill Points Gained: 1]

Artie slumped against the only remaining piece of rock in the vicinity. He felt a strange sense of accomplishment, mostly overshadowed by the fact that he was still a single sneeze away from death.

"Fizz," he croaked.

"Yes, Artie?"

"Don't tell the Admin."

"The Admin already knows, Artie. The Admin is currently wondering why there’s a hole in the map where the slimes are supposed to live."

Artie closed his eyes, the Level Up glow bathing his tired face in a soft, golden light. He was alive. He was Level 2. And he was officially the most dangerous thing in the Whispering Woods.
