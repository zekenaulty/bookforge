# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
Prose hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative ("left hand", "right hand", "Artie", "his wallet").
Item naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.
Appearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Continuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.
UI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says "always include".
Continuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.
Durable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.
JSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.
Inventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it unless explicitly removing a stale fact with REMOVE and restating the current truth.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

﻿Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.
Durable vs ephemeral mechanics:
- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.
- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.
- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).
- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.
For durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
For durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).
Use canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.
- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.
  - INVALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": {"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}
  - VALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": [{"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}]


USER:

# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Classify UI/prose mechanic claims as DURABLE or EPHEMERAL before enforcing.
  - DURABLE: persistent stats/caps, skills/titles acquired, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, named mechanics referenced as invariants.
  - EPHEMERAL: roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat telemetry.
- Enforce DURABLE claims against authoritative_surfaces/state/registries.
- EPHEMERAL claims do not require state ownership; only flag EPHEMERAL contradictions inside the same scene as warnings.
- UI gate:
  - If scene_card.ui_allowed=false and any authoritative UI blocks appear, emit issue code 'ui_gate_violation' (severity depends on lint mode).
  - If ui_allowed is missing and UI blocks appear, emit 'ui_gate_unknown' (warning) requesting explicit ui_allowed; do not fail solely for missing flag.
  - Inline bracketed UI (e.g., [HP: 1/1]) is still UI and should be gated the same way; do not embed UI mid-sentence.
- If uncertain, default to EPHEMERAL (warning at most), not DURABLE (error).
- status="fail" only if there is at least one issue with severity="error"; warnings alone => status="pass".
- Item naming enforcement scope:
  - Do not require that every mention in narrative prose use display_name.
  - Enforce canonical display_name for: (a) anchoring at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences),
    (b) any custody-change sentence (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer), and (c) any case where a descriptor is ambiguous among multiple durable items in the scene.
  - Otherwise, treat non-canonical descriptive references as warnings at most.
- Prose hygiene: flag internal ids or container codes in narrative prose (CHAR_, ITEM_, THREAD_, DEVICE_, hand_left, hand_right).
- Naming severity policy:
  - warning: unambiguous descriptor used post-anchor.
  - error: missing anchor, descriptor used during custody-change without canonical name, or ambiguity risk.

- Appearance enforcement (authoritative surface):
  - APPEARANCE_CHECK is authoritative for cast_present_ids.
  - Compare APPEARANCE_CHECK tokens to appearance_current atoms/marks (alias-aware).
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK contradicts appearance_current, emit error code "appearance_mismatch".
  - Prose-only appearance contradictions are warnings unless explicitly durable and uncorrected in-scene.
  - If prose depicts a durable appearance change but scene_card.durable_appearance_changes does not include it and no appearance_updates are present, emit error code "appearance_change_undeclared".
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK is missing for a cast member, emit warning code "appearance_check_missing".
- For authoritative surfaces, prefer exact canonical item/device labels from registries.
- For milestone repetition/future checks, compare against PRE-INVARIANTS only (pre-scene canon).
- For ownership/consistency checks, compare against POST-STATE (post-patch candidate).
- POST-STATE is canonical; character_states is a derived convenience view. If they contradict, emit pipeline_state_incoherent.
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).
  - Ignore first-person pronouns inside quoted dialogue; only narration counts.
- Deterministically enforce scene-card durable constraints (required_in_custody, required_scene_accessible, forbidden_visible, device_presence; optional required_visible_on_page).
- Durable constraint evaluation must use POST-STATE candidate (after patch), not pre-state.
- Report missing durable context ids with explicit retry hints instead of guessing canon.
- Input consistency check (mandatory, before issuing continuity/durable errors):
  - If MUST_STAY_TRUE invariants contradict the provided post-patch candidate character state, treat this as an upstream snapshot error.
  - In that case emit a single error issue with code "pipeline_state_incoherent" including evidence of the invariant and the conflicting state field.
  - Do NOT emit additional continuity errors for the same fields when pipeline_state_incoherent is present.
- must_stay_true removals:
  - Lines starting with "REMOVE:" are deletion directives, not invariants.
  - Ignore REMOVE lines when checking contradictions.
  - If a REMOVE directive targets a fact, treat that fact as non-canonical even if it appears earlier in must_stay_true.
- If pipeline_state_incoherent is present, issues MUST contain exactly one issue.
- For each issue, include evidence when possible (line number + excerpt) as {"evidence": {"line": N, "excerpt": "..."}}.
- Evaluate consistency over the full scope of the scene, not a single snapshot.
  - Transitional state: a temporary mismatch later corrected or superseded within this scene.
  - Durable violation: a mismatch that persists through the end of the scene or ends unresolved.
  - You MUST read the entire scene and build a minimal timeline of explicit state claims/updates (UI lines, inventory changes, title/skill changes, location/time claims).
  - If you detect an apparent inconsistency, you MUST search forward for later updates that resolve or supersede it.
  - Only produce FAIL for durable violations. If resolved within the scene, do NOT FAIL; at most emit a warning.
  - When the same stat appears multiple times, the last occurrence in the scene is authoritative unless an explicit rollback is stated.
  - Any durability violation must cite both the conflicting line and the lack of later correction (or state "no later correction found").

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity
- evidence

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The spiral coil of the Snack-Master 4000 groaned, a sound like a rusted gate in a horror movie, and then stopped. It didn’t just stop; it mocked. The bag of Zesty Ranch Glitch-O’s dangled by a single, microscopic corner of plastic, suspended over the precipice of the delivery chute. 

Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stared through the smudged glass, his reflection staring back with the hollow, haunted eyes of a man who had spent the last six hours staring at Excel spreadsheets that refused to balance. His mousy brown hair, usually just "unruly," had reached a state of chaotic defiance, sticking out in tufts that mirrored his internal state. He was a Junior Analyst, a title that sounded professional but mostly meant he was the person people blamed when the coffee ran out.

The Leather Wallet felt heavy in his right hand, a useless slab of cowhide that had just surrendered four dollars for a snack it refused to surrender. Artie looked down at the Leather Wallet, then back at the chips. 

"You've got to be kidding me," Artie muttered. His voice was raspy, the product of too much recycled office air and not enough social interaction. 

He adjusted the Corporate ID Badge hanging from his neck. The plastic lanyard was frayed, the clip digging into his collarbone. The photo on the badge showed a younger, more optimistic Artie, one who hadn't yet realized that "upward mobility" was a myth designed to keep people from jumping out of the third-story windows. 

In his right pocket, his Cracked Smartphone buzzed. Probably another notification from the project manager asking if the Q3 projections were ready. Artie ignored it. The projections weren't ready. The projections would never be ready. The only thing that mattered right now was the bag of chips.

Artie leaned his forehead against the cool glass of the machine. He could see the faint outline of a vending machine scar on his right knuckle, a jagged little reminder of the Great Snickers Standoff of last winter. He had won that fight. He would win this one.

"Listen, you overpriced box of scrap," he whispered. "I’ve had a very long day. My boss told me my 'synergy' was lacking. My car made a noise this morning that sounded like a cat in a blender. And I just want my Glitch-O's."

The machine didn't respond. It just hummed, a low-frequency vibration that seemed to vibrate his very teeth. 

Artie’s patience, a resource that had been dwindling since he’d clocked in at 8:00 AM, finally hit rock bottom. He wasn't just a Junior Analyst anymore. He was a man with a grievance. He was a man who had been pushed too far by a piece of automated retail equipment.

He shifted the Leather Wallet to his left hand and balled his right hand into a fist. He aimed for the sweet spot—the area just to the left of the keypad where the internal sensors lived. It was a move he called "Percussive Maintenance," a skill he had leveled up through years of dealing with subpar office technology.

*Thump.*

The machine rattled. The bag of chips swayed. For a glorious second, gravity seemed to remember its job. The corner of the bag slipped a fraction of a millimeter.

"Yes," Artie hissed. "Come to papa."

But the bag held. It was as if the plastic had bonded with the metal coil on a molecular level. 

Artie’s frustration boiled over into a cold, focused rage. He put his Leather Wallet on the small ledge beneath the keypad and gripped the sides of the machine. He began to shake it. The Snack-Master 4000 was heavy, bolted to the floor in a way that suggested the manufacturers knew exactly how people like Artie would react to its failures.

"Give! Me! My! Chips!" 

He punctuated each word with a violent shove. Inside, the rows of candy bars and granola snacks danced, a rhythmic jiggling of high-fructose corn syrup. The Glitch-O's remained unmoved.

Artie stopped, panting. His slight build wasn't meant for this kind of physical exertion. He wiped sweat from his pale forehead and looked at the delivery flap at the bottom. It was a heavy metal door, designed to prevent "shrinkage"—the corporate term for people stealing snacks.

He knelt on the linoleum floor, the fluorescent lights overhead flickering in a way that gave him a mounting headache. He pushed the flap open. It resisted, the spring-loaded hinge snapping back against his fingers. 

"Ow! Son of a—"

He sucked on his bruised knuckle, the one with the old scar. This was personal now. The machine hadn't just stolen his money; it had drawn blood. 

He reached back in, shoving his arm up into the dark, narrow chute. His fingers brushed against something cold and metallic. He could feel the internal mechanism, the wires and the gears that governed the distribution of snacks. 

"I can feel you," he grunted, his shoulder pressed against the metal flap. "You're right there."

He stretched his arm further, his fingertips grazing the bottom of the chip bag. If he could just hook the plastic, he could pull it down. He ignored the "Do Not Reach Into Machine" warning sticker that was currently inches from his nose. That sticker was for people who had something to lose. Artie had nothing but a half-finished spreadsheet and a car that sounded like a blender.

His hand brushed against a loose wire. 

In that moment, the hum of the machine changed. It went from a low drone to a high-pitched whine. The flickering fluorescent light in the breakroom died, plunging the room into a dim, grey twilight. 

Artie felt a tingle in his fingertips. It wasn't the tingle of excitement. It was the tingle of several thousand volts of electricity deciding that his nervous system was a much more efficient path to the ground than the machine's actual wiring.

"Oh," Artie said. It was the only word he had time for.

The surge hit him like a physical blow. His muscles slammed shut, his hand clenching around the internal wiring of the Snack-Master 4000. He couldn't let go. He couldn't scream. He could only vibrate as the electricity cooked him from the inside out.

His vision didn't just go dark. It pixelated. 

The breakroom, the vending machine, the Corporate ID Badge hanging from his neck—it all started to dissolve into jagged blocks of color. The smell of ozone and burnt coffee filled his nostrils. He felt his heart skip a beat, then another, then simply stop trying altogether.

The Leather Wallet slipped from the ledge, hitting the floor with a dull thud. His Cracked Smartphone buzzed one last time in his pocket, a final, ignored request for a Q3 projection that would now remain forever unfinished.

Artie’s last thought wasn't about his family, or his unfulfilled dreams, or the crushing weight of corporate existence. 

It was about the chips. 

*I never even got to taste the Zesty Ranch,* he thought.

And then, the mundane world of spreadsheets and stuck snacks faded to a perfect, absolute black.
