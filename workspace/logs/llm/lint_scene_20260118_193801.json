Weave a narrative rich with subtle foreshadowing and intricate plot threads, ensuring that major reveals feel earned and are judiciously hinted at throughout the text. Maintain a mythic and epic tone through descriptive language and thematic depth. Develop complex, morally ambiguous characters alongside clear heroes and villains, exploring their internal conflicts and motivations. Integrate world-building seamlessly, avoiding direct info-dumps. Vary sentence structure and pacing, using longer, flowing sentences for description and shorter, impactful ones for tension and revelation. Avoid deus ex machina, predictable character arcs, and simplistic moral resolutions. Focus on creating a layered reading experience where the importance of minor details becomes clear in surprising, satisfying ways, rewarding attentive readers.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\n",

Eldrin leaned heavily against a fluted column, his lungs burning with the grit of pulverized marble. In his mind\u2019s eye, the column was still draped in banners of woven light, and the air of Aethelgard carried the scent of ozone and blooming jasmine.\n\nReality was a more jagged thing.\n\n\"It won\u2019t stop,\" Kaelen Vane grunted. The younger man stood over the central dais, his right hand gripped tightly around his left wrist. Even from a distance, Eldrin could see the unnatural tremor in Kaelen\u2019s fingers, a rhythmic twitch that mirrored the azure heartbeat of the sphere. \"The resonance... it\u2019s digging into the bone.\"\n\nEldrin closed his eyes, reaching out with a sense that had once commanded the very tides of the Aether. He sought the familiar pull of the world-veins, the golden threads of power that should have been humming beneath the floorboards of the world. He found only a vast, echoing silence. It was as if he were reaching for a limb that had long since been amputated. The phantom itch of power remained, but when he tried to grasp it, his fingers met nothing but the cold, stagnant void.\n\nHe was a master of nothing. A sage of a ghost-world.\n\n\"Leave it for a moment, Kaelen,\" Eldrin said, his voice a dry rasp. \"The tremor has compromised the archway. If we agitate the sphere further, the ceiling will finish what the centuries started.\"\n\nHe gestured toward the primary entrance. The massive stone lintel had buckled during the initial pulse, and a cascade of fresh debris now choked the passage, leaving only a narrow, jagged gap near the top. The 'hum' Kaelen described was audible to Eldrin now\u2014not as a sound, but as a discordance in the air, a sour note in a song he had known by heart.\n\n\"We can't leave it,\" Kaelen countered, his face pale beneath the grime. \"If the storm outside gets in, or if the Blight-stalkers followed us...\"\n\nEldrin didn't answer. He dragged himself away from the column, his boots crunching on fragments of history. He reached out to touch the wall, intending to use a simple cantrip of mending to stabilize the masonry. He whispered the syllable\u2014*\u2019Oros*\u2014and waited for the rush of warmth, the surge of structural intent.\n\nNothing happened.\n\nA sharp, stinging pain flared in his chest, a reminder of his mortality. The magic didn't just fail; it felt rejected. The world he had returned to was no longer a partner to his will. It was a corpse, and he was a maggot crawling upon its skin.\n\n\"The resonance is changing,\" Kaelen warned, stepping back from the dais. The azure light of the sphere had turned a bruised, sickly violet. The heat intensified, turning the air into a shimmering haze. \n\n\"We need the alternate exit,\" Eldrin said, forcing himself to stand tall despite the trembling in his knees. \"The subterranean transit. If the ley-lines are dead, the mechanical locks will have defaulted to manual.\"\n\nHe led the way toward the shadows behind the dais, his movements stiff. Every step was a battle against the realization that he was no longer the architect of his fate. He was a passenger in a ruined carriage.\n\nAs they neared the rear vestibule, a draft of air cut through the stifling heat. It wasn't the fresh, crisp air of the highlands Eldrin remembered. It was a draft that smelled of wet ash and fermented copper. It carried a chill that didn't just touch the skin\u2014it seemed to erode the spirit.\n\nEldrin paused at a narrow slit in the masonry, a lookout point that peered through the outer shell of the ruins toward the valley below. He looked out, expecting to see the silver-leaf forests of the Aethel-reach, perhaps scarred by time but still vibrant.\n\nWhat he saw stopped his breath.\n\nThe valley was a sea of grey, undulating rot. The trees weren't dead; they were transformed, their limbs twisted into obsidian-slick claws that reached toward a sky the color of a fresh bruise. The very soil seemed to be weeping a black, viscous ichor that pooled in the hollows of the earth. There was no green, no gold, no breath of life. The Shadow Blight hadn't just conquered the land; it had rewritten its fundamental nature. It had replaced the living pulse of the world with a slow, rhythmic decay.\n\n\"It's not just a plague,\" Eldrin whispered, his hand trembling as he gripped the stone. The realization hit him with more force than the tremor. \"It\u2019s a replacement. The world isn't dying, Kaelen. It\u2019s being unmade.\"\n\nThe obsidian sphere behind them let out a low, mournful wail, and the violet light flared, casting long, distorted shadows against the ruin\u2019s walls\u2014shadows that seemed to move with a predatory intent of their own.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 2\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_001/scene_002.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"DRAFTING\",\n  \"world\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [],\n    \"location\": \"\",\n    \"open_threads\": [],\n    \"recent_facts\": [],\n    \"time\": {}\n  }\n}\n\nInvariants:\n[\n  \"No world resets.\",\n  \"No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\",\n  \"Do not change established names/relationships.\"\n]\n"
