Your writing is characterized by a tight, limited third-person perspective that never breaks into omniscient narration. You must maintain strict continuity, ensuring that characters utilize their full range of established skills and knowledge. Do not use 'As you know' dialogue or provide summaries of previous events. When a scene begins, drop the reader directly into the character's current sensory experience. Avoid clich\u00e9s in descriptions; instead of 'cold as ice,' describe the 'brittle, biting snap of air that makes the lungs ache.' Ensure all plot payoffs are seeded with subtle clues in earlier movements. Magic and high-fantasy elements must have clear costs and logical consistency.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\n",

His palms, raw and weeping from the failed mending, stuck to the translucent surface of the crystal. Every jagged edge of the internal fractures felt like a razor\u2019s edge pressed against his mind. The ward-light was dying, flickering in rhythmic gasps that matched the shallow thud of his own heart. \n\nHe pulled his hands away, the skin tearing slightly where the glass had begun to fuse with his sweat and blood. The scent of scorched copper was thick here, a metallic shroud that stifled the thin mountain air. Below the High Spire, the valley should have been a carpet of nocturnal life\u2014the distant lowing of livestock, the flicker of hearth-fires in the foothills, the rustle of the pines. Instead, it was a bowl of absolute, terrifying silence. The void-influence had swallowed the sound days ago, but now, even the shadows seemed to be holding their breath.\n\nA pinprick of violet tore through the upper atmosphere.\n\nIt didn't streak like a falling stone. It didn't burn with the orange-white friction of the heavens. It descended with a predatory deliberation, a jagged tear of bruised light that bled across the sky. As it dropped, the sky-glass anchor behind Kaelen began to scream. The sound was a high-frequency whine that shattered the stillness, a mourning cry of ancient lattice-work recognizing its executioner. \n\nKaelen leaned against the stone parapet, his legs trembling. The Starwrought Oath hummed in his blood, a cold, tethered weight that pulled toward the falling light. The cost of the failed mending was a hollow ache in his chest, a sensation of being emptied of heat. He watched the violet star grow, expanding from a spark into a Great Eye of malevolent radiance. It cast long, distorted shadows across the Spire\u2019s masonry\u2014shadows that didn't point away from the light, but seemed to reach toward it, hungry and desperate.\n\nThe light turned the valley into a landscape of bruised velvet. The trees were silhouettes of charcoal against a sky that had forgotten the stars. Kaelen\u2019s vision blurred, the violet glare searing into his retinas. He should have been down there. He should have been sounding the bells, rallying the weavers, doing anything other than standing atop a crumbling relic watching the end of the world arrive in silence. But the Oath held him here, bound to the failing anchor, a captain tethered to a sinking mast.\n\nThe star didn't hit the ground so much as it erased it. \n\nWhen it touched the valley floor, there was no immediate explosion of fire. There was only a flash of negative space, a sphere of violet-black that expanded with sickening speed. For three heartbeats, the world was perfectly, unnaturally still. Kaelen saw the shockwave before he felt it\u2014a ripple in the air that distorted the horizon, turning the solid earth into a liquid wave of dust and uprooted forest.\n\nThen the sound arrived.\n\nIt wasn't a boom. It was a tectonic grind, the sound of the world\u2019s spine snapping under an impossible weight. The High Spire groaned, the ancient stones shifting with a dry, rasping protest. The sky-glass anchor behind Kaelen didn't just fracture further; it erupted. Shards of crystal, energized by the impact\u2019s resonance, hissed through the air like shrapnel. \n\nKaelen threw himself to the floor, his face pressed against the cold, vibrating stone. The shockwave hit the Spire with the force of a physical blow. The entire structure leaned, the foundations screaming as they fought to remain anchored to the peak. Dust choked him, tasting of old lime and the bitter, acidic tang of the starfall. \n\nHe gripped the edge of a floor-tile, his fingernails cracking against the stone. The roar went on and on, a continuous, deafening howl that stripped away thought and replaced it with a primal, suffocating dread. Through the gaps in the parapet, he saw the valley floor glowing with a low, pulsing amethyst light, the impact site a wound in the earth that refused to close. \n\nThe silence that followed was worse than the noise. It was a heavy, pressurized quiet that made his ears bleed. Kaelen pushed himself up, his muscles screaming in protest. His hands were shaking so violently he had to tuck them into his sleeves. The sky-glass anchor was a ruin of jagged stumps, its light completely extinguished. \n\nThe sun was still hours away, but the valley was no longer dark. It was bathed in the sickly, rhythmic throb of the fallen star, a beacon for whatever was coming next. Kaelen looked at his hands, seeing the faint, violet luminescence beginning to trace the veins beneath his skin. The Oath wasn't just humming anymore; it was singing, a discordant melody that promised he would not be allowed to die until the debt was paid in full.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 2\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"outline\": {\n    \"path\": \"outline/outline.json\"\n  },\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_001/scene_002.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"DRAFTING\",\n  \"world\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_kaelen\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"High Spire\",\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_oath_binding\"\n    ],\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"The primary sky-glass anchor of the High Spire has developed irreversible internal fractures.\",\n      \"Kaelen's attempts to stabilize the wards with his own vitality have failed.\",\n      \"The surrounding valley is silent and consumed by void-influence.\",\n      \"Kaelen has confirmed the wards will collapse before sunrise.\"\n    ],\n    \"time\": {}\n  }\n}\n\nInvariants:\n[\n  \"No world resets.\",\n  \"No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\",\n  \"Do not change established names/relationships.\"\n]\n"
