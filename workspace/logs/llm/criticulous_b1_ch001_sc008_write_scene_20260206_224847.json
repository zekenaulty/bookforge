CHAR_VANE -> Masterwork Rapier (sheath).\n\nPROSE:\n\nThe heavy oak doors of the Mayor\u2019s office clicked shut behind me, the sound echoing through the marble-floored hallway like a judge\u2019s gavel. I stood there for a second, my fingers cramping around the handle of the Participation Trophy in my left hand. It was cold, heavy, and currently pulsing with a faint, rhythmic light that seemed to say, *\u2018Hey, look at me! I\u2019m a high-value target with the durability of a wet paper towel!\u2019*\n\n[Quest Updated: The Mayor\u2019s Cut]\n[Objective: Pay 500 Gold or provide 10 Crit-Forged items.]\n[Time Remaining: 23:58:12]\n[Penalty for Failure: Deportation to the Unpatched Wilds (Instant Death for 1 HP builds).]\n\n\"Great,\" I whispered, the word tasting like copper. \"I\u2019ve been in this world for less than three hours and I\u2019m already being shook down by the local government. It\u2019s like my internship at the accounting firm all over again, but with more chance of being eaten by a wolf.\"\n\nI started down the hallway, my Broken Tutorial Sword still gripped in my right hand. I probably looked like a lunatic\u2014a man in a linen tunic carrying a rusted piece of scrap metal and a glowing trophy that smelled vaguely of ozone and disappointment. I needed a plan. I needed gold. Most of all, I needed to not get breathed on too hard by anything with an offensive stat higher than zero.\n\nI didn't even make it to the grand staircase before the air in the hallway changed. It grew heavy, smelling of expensive incense and polished steel. \n\nLeaning against a white marble pillar was a man who looked like he\u2019d been designed by a committee of people who thought 'protagonist' was a personality trait. He was tall, draped in a Silk Cloak that probably cost more than my entire life insurance policy back home, and he had the kind of jawline you could use to chip ice. Above his head, the System labels flickered in a golden hue that made my eyes ache.\n\n[Vane - Lvl 28] [Class: Sun-Blessed Paladin] [Affiliation: Order of the Golden Ratio]\n\nTwenty-eight. He was Level 28. I was Level 2. I was a 'Statistical Anomaly' with 1 HP. He was a literal god-king in comparison. \n\nVane didn't move as I approached, but his eyes followed me. They weren't looking at my face; they were locked onto the flickering neon text that hovered above my head, the one the gate scanners had so graciously gifted me.\n\n[Title: Statistical Anomaly]\n\n\"So,\" Vane said, his voice a smooth baritone that made me want to punch him and then apologize for it. \"You\u2019re the glitch the Mayor is so worried about. The 'walking mint' with the broken numbers.\"\n\nI stopped five paces back. \"I prefer the term 'optimization specialist,' but 'glitch' works if you\u2019re into brevity. And you are?\"\n\n\"Vane,\" he said, pushing off the pillar. He moved with a fluid grace that suggested high Dexterity and a complete lack of soul. \"I lead the local contingent of the Order. We maintain the balance of the System. And usually, when something is as... unbalanced... as you appear to be, it\u2019s my job to see if it needs a patch.\"\n\nI felt a cold sweat break out on my neck. My 1 HP bar was invisible to him\u2014I hoped\u2014but the [Statistical Anomaly] tag was a massive neon sign saying *'Examine Me.'*\n\n\"I\u2019m already under a Variance Tax, Vane,\" I said, trying to keep my voice from cracking. \"The Mayor\u2019s already got his hand in my pockets. If you\u2019re looking for a bribe, you\u2019re about 500 gold too late.\"\n\nVane smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. He reached down to the hilt of the weapon at his hip. It was a Masterwork Rapier, the handguard shaped like a sunburst, the steel so bright it seemed to hold its own light.\n\n\"I don't care for gold,\" Vane said. \"I care for data. The gate scanners reported a 100% Critical Hit rate. Statistically impossible. Even the most dedicated Luck-builds cap out at forty percent before the diminishing returns kick in. You\u2019re a walking impossibility, Arthur.\"\n\n\"Artie,\" I corrected. \"And it\u2019s not impossible if the math allows it. It\u2019s just... unlikely.\"\n\n\"Is it?\" Vane took a step forward. The hallway felt smaller. \"I want to see it. A friendly spar. Just to see how the 'Anomaly' handles a real blade. I\u2019ll even set my damage output to 'Training' mode.\"\n\n[System Notification: Vane has initiated a Duel Request (Friendly).]\n[Rules: First to 10% HP or First Yield.]\n[Warning: Even in 'Training' mode, minimum damage is 1 HP.]\n\nMy heart did a frantic tap-dance against my ribs. Minimum damage was 1 HP. If he so much as grazed my sleeve, I was a ghost. The 'Friendly' duel would be the shortest, most lethal encounter in the history of Oakhaven.\n\n\"I don\u2019t spar for free,\" I said, forcing a smirk I didn't feel. I shifted my weight, making sure the Participation Trophy was visible. \"And honestly? You\u2019re not geared for it.\"\n\nVane paused, his hand tightening on the rapier\u2019s hilt. \"Excuse me?\"\n\n\"You\u2019re a Paladin. High defense, high sustain, moderate burst,\" I said, leaning into the bluff I\u2019d used on the Mayor. \"But you\u2019re looking at my HP and thinking I\u2019m a glass cannon. You think you can just tap me and the duel is over.\"\n\n\"You have 1 Health, Anomaly,\" Vane said, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. \"I can see the bar. It\u2019s a single red pixel.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" I said, stepping closer. I was within his reach now. If he drew that rapier, I was dead before I could blink. \"Do you really think someone would walk into a Level 28 zone with 1 HP if they didn't have a way to make sure that 1 HP never moves? Have you ever heard of the 'Perfect Guard' build, Vane? Or are you too busy polishing your cape to read the high-level theory-crafting forums?\"\n\nVane\u2019s eyes narrowed. The rapier stayed in its sheath, but only just. \"Perfect Guard is a myth. A theoretical build that requires frame-perfect timing and a 100% reflection rate. No one can maintain that.\"\n\n\"No one *normal*,\" I said, tapping the [Statistical Anomaly] tag above my head. \"But I\u2019m the guy who broke the gate scanner. I don't dodge, Vane. I don't need to. Every hit you land on me while my guard is up doesn't just do zero damage\u2014it reflects 200% of the force back at the attacker. That\u2019s why my HP is 1. It\u2019s a bait. A lure for people like you who think a small number means a weak player.\"\n\nI could see the gears turning in his head. In a world governed by stats, a 1 HP build was either a joke or a terrifying exploit. And since I was covered in 'Anomaly' flags and carrying a soul-bound trophy that was currently vibrating with ancient energy, Vane was leaning toward the latter.\n\n\"A reflection build,\" Vane muttered. He looked at my Broken Tutorial Sword. \"And the 100% Crit rate?\"\n\n\"If I reflect your attack, the counter-hit is a guaranteed Critical,\" I lied through my teeth. \"It\u2019s a closed loop of mathematical inevitability. You swing, you die. I stay at 1 HP. It\u2019s very efficient. Saves a fortune on health potions.\"\n\nVane drew his Masterwork Rapier. The sound of steel on leather was like a whistle. He didn't lunge, but he held the point inches from my chest. I didn't move. I couldn't. My legs were basically made of jelly, but I forced my eyes to stay locked on his.\n\n\"One touch,\" Vane said. \"If your 'Perfect Guard' is real, I\u2019ll feel the kickback. If it\u2019s not... well, the System will have one less bug to worry about.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" I said, my voice steady despite the fact that I was screaming internally. \"But fair warning: Oakhaven\u2019s insurance doesn't cover 'Suicide by Math.' If you break your fancy sword on my chest, don't come crying to me for the repair bill.\"\n\nVane hesitated. The rapier\u2019s tip quivered. He was looking for a tell\u2014a flinch, a shift in posture, anything that betrayed my terror. But I was so terrified I\u2019d reached a state of catatonic stillness that apparently looked like supreme confidence.\n\n[Status: Bluffed_Perfect_Guard is highly effective!]\n[Vane is reconsidering his tactical approach.]\n\n\"You\u2019re either the most dangerous man in this town,\" Vane said, slowly lowering the blade, \"or the luckiest liar I\u2019ve ever met.\"\n\n\"In this world, is there a difference?\" I asked.\n\nI didn't wait for him to respond. I turned my back on him\u2014a move that was either the ultimate power play or the stupidest thing I\u2019d ever done\u2014and started walking toward the stairs. Every step felt like I was walking on a tightrope over a pit of spikes. I expected to feel a rapier through my spine at any second.\n\n\"This isn't over, Anomaly!\" Vane called out behind me. I heard the *shink* of his rapier returning to its sheath. \"The Variance Tax isn't the only thing you have to worry about. The Order will be watching. If you\u2019re a virus, we\u2019ll find the cure.\"\n\n\"Good luck with that,\" I muttered under my breath, finally reaching the stairs and rounding the corner. \"I\u2019ve been trying to find the cure for my own life for years. Let me know if you find a patch for 'Student Loans' while you're at it.\"\n\nI didn't stop moving until I was out of the building and half a block away, tucked into the shadows of a merchant\u2019s stall. I leaned against the cold stone wall, my breath coming in ragged gasps.\n\n[Stamina: 14/100]\n[Hunger: 10/100 (Flickering Orange)]\n\n\"Fizz?\" I whispered.\n\nA small, pixelated sprite popped into existence near my ear, her wings buzzing with nervous energy. \"Artie! That was... wow. I actually thought I was going to have to find a new protagonist. Do you have any idea how hard it is to fill out the 'Death by Paladin' paperwork?\"\n\n\"I almost died, Fizz. He had a Level 28 rapier. I could feel the heat coming off it.\"\n\n\"But you didn't!\" Fizz chirped, doing a loop-de-loop. \"You successfully bluffed a Sun-Blessed Paladin! Do you know what that does for your hidden 'Charisma-Exploit' modifier? Nothing, because I just made that up, but it was still impressive!\"\n\nI looked down at my hands. They were shaking. I still had 1 HP. I still had a 500-gold tax due in twenty-four hours. And now, I had a high-level fanatic convinced I was a walking WMD of reflection damage.\n\n\"I need gear,\" I said, pushing off the wall. \"Real gear. Something that actually gives me Evasion or... or anything that isn't a linen tunic. If Vane sees me trip over a rug and die, the bluff is over.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Fizz said, pointing her tiny wand toward the town gates. \"The Mayor mentioned the Low-Level Crypts. Lots of skeletons, very predictable patterns, and most importantly? High-drop rates for 'Coward\u2019s Gear.' It\u2019s perfect for you!\"\n\n\"Coward\u2019s gear,\" I sighed. \"Fine. Lead the way. But if I see Vane again, I\u2019m hiding in a barrel.\"\n\n\"A barrel? How classic! I\u2019ll mark it on your map as a 'Tactical Stealth Container'.\"\n\nI started walking, the Participation Trophy glowing in my hand, a beacon for every monster and rival in Oakhaven. I was a Statistical Anomaly, a 1 HP glitch in a world of giants, and somehow, I had to find a way to make the math work in my favor before the System decided to delete me for good.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present_ids\": [\"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"CHAR_VANE\"],\n    \"location\": \"Oakhaven - Hallway and Streets\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie encountered Vane outside the Mayor's office.\",\n      \"Vane attempted to force Artie into a duel to test his 'Anomaly' status.\",\n      \"Artie successfully maintained the 'Perfect Guard' bluff, convincing Vane he reflects damage.\",\n      \"Vane is suspicious but retreated, promising to watch Artie.\",\n      \"Artie is suffering from low stamina and hunger.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"character_stat_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"stats\": {\n        \"stamina\": { \"set\": 14 },\n        \"hunger\": { \"set\": 10 }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 8,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        { \"container\": \"hand_right\", \"item\": \"Broken Tutorial Sword\", \"status\": \"carried\" },\n        { \"container\": \"hand_left\", \"item\": \"Participation Trophy\", \"status\": \"carried\" },\n        { \"container\": \"body\", \"item\": \"Linen Tunic\", \"status\": \"equipped\" },\n        { \"container\": \"pockets\", \"item\": \"Single Copper Coin\", \"status\": \"stowed\" }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        { \"container\": \"hand_right\", \"contents\": [\"Broken Tutorial Sword\"], \"location\": \"arm_right\" },\n        { \"container\": \"hand_left\", \"contents\": [\"Participation Trophy\"], \"location\": \"arm_left\" },\n        { \"container\": \"body\", \"contents\": [\"Linen Tunic\"], \"location\": \"torso\" },\n        { \"container\": \"pockets\", \"contents\": [\"Single Copper Coin\"], \"location\": \"legs\" }\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie is perfecting the art of the 'System-Logic' bluff to survive high-level encounters.\",\n        \"Artie is increasingly paranoid about his 1 HP vulnerability.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_VANE\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 8,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        { \"container\": \"sheath\", \"item\": \"Masterwork Rapier\", \"status\": \"stowed\" },\n        { \"container\": \"shoulders\", \"item\": \"Silk Cloak\", \"status\": \"equipped\" }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        { \"container\": \"sheath\", \"contents\": [\"Masterwork Rapier\"], \"location\": \"belt_left\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_VANE\" }\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Vane is obsessed with 'System Balance' and views anomalies as bugs to be patched.\",\n        \"Vane is intrigued and threatened by Artie's claimed 'Perfect Guard' build.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie was confronted by the Paladin Vane outside the Mayor's office.\",\n      \"Vane challenged Artie to a duel to verify his 'Statistical Anomaly' status and 100% Crit rate.\",\n      \"Artie successfully bluffed that his 1 HP was a 'Perfect Guard' reflection build, causing Vane to stand down.\",\n      \"Artie escaped the encounter and began heading toward the Low-Level Crypts to find better gear.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Met Vane (Lvl 28 Paladin) in the Oakhaven government hall.\",\n      \"Vane initiated a Duel Request which Artie declined via a psychological bluff.\",\n      \"Reinforced the 'Perfect Guard' lie to explain the 1 HP stat.\",\n      \"Established THREAD_VANE_RIVALRY as Vane promised to monitor Artie for 'System instability'.\",\n      \"Artie's hunger and stamina reached critical low levels.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"milestone: variance_tax_imposed = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: vane_first_encounter = DONE\",\n      \"status: bluffed_perfect_guard = ACTIVE\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Participation Trophy (carried, container=hand_left)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Broken Tutorial Sword (carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_VANE -> Masterwork Rapier (carried, container=sheath)\",\n      \"Artie has 1 HP and 100% Crit Rate.\",\n      \"Artie's Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit is on a 24-hour cooldown.\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Artie has bluffed his way past both the Mayor and the city's highest-ranking Paladin.\",\n      \"Vane has been established as a primary antagonist who views Artie as a 'virus' in the System.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"threads_touched\": [\"THREAD_VANE_RIVALRY\", \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"]\n}",

I leaned against the cold stone wall, my breath coming in ragged gasps.\n\n[Stamina: 14/100]\n[Hunger: 10/100 (Flickering Orange)]\n\n\"Fizz?\" I whispered.\n\nA small, pixelated sprite popped into existence near my ear, her wings buzzing with nervous energy. \"Artie! That was... wow. I actually thought I was going to have to find a new protagonist. Do you have any idea how hard it is to fill out the 'Death by Paladin' paperwork?\"\n\n\"I almost died, Fizz. He had a Level 28 rapier. I could feel the heat coming off it.\"\n\n\"But you didn't!\" Fizz chirped, doing a loop-de-loop. \"You successfully bluffed a Sun-Blessed Paladin! Do you know what that does for your hidden 'Charisma-Exploit' modifier? Nothing, because I just made that up, but it was still impressive!\"\n\nI looked down at my hands. They were shaking. I still had 1 HP. I still had a 500-gold tax due in twenty-four hours. And now, I had a high-level fanatic convinced I was a walking WMD of reflection damage.\n\n\"I need gear,\" I said, pushing off the wall. \"Real gear. Something that actually gives me Evasion or... or anything that isn't a linen tunic. If Vane sees me trip over a rug and die, the bluff is over.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Fizz said, pointing her tiny wand toward the town gates. \"The Mayor mentioned the Low-Level Crypts. Lots of skeletons, very predictable patterns, and most importantly? High-drop rates for 'Coward\u2019s Gear.' It\u2019s perfect for you!\"\n\n\"Coward\u2019s gear,\" I sighed. \"Fine. Lead the way. But if I see Vane again, I\u2019m hiding in a barrel.\"\n\n\"A barrel? How classic! I\u2019ll mark it on your map as a 'Tactical Stealth Container'.\"\n\nI started walking, the Participation Trophy glowing in my hand, a beacon for every monster and rival in Oakhaven. I was a Statistical Anomaly, a 1 HP glitch in a world of giants, and somehow, I had to find a way to make the math work in my favor before the System decided to delete me for good.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present_ids\": [\"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"CHAR_VANE\"],\n    \"location\": \"Oakhaven - Hallway and Streets\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie encountered Vane outside the Mayor's office.\",\n      \"Vane attempted to force Artie into a duel to test his 'Anomaly' status.\",\n      \"Artie successfully maintained the 'Perfect Guard' bluff, convincing Vane he reflects damage.\",\n      \"Vane is suspicious but retreated, promising to watch Artie.\",\n      \"Artie is suffering from low stamina and hunger.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"character_stat_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"stats\": {\n        \"stamina\": { \"set\": 14 },\n        \"hunger\": { \"set\": 10 }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 8,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        { \"container\": \"hand_right\", \"item\": \"Broken Tutorial Sword\", \"status\": \"carried\" },\n        { \"container\": \"hand_left\", \"item\": \"Participation Trophy\", \"status\": \"carried\" },\n        { \"container\": \"body\", \"item\": \"Linen Tunic\", \"status\": \"equipped\" },\n        { \"container\": \"pockets\", \"item\": \"Single Copper Coin\", \"status\": \"stowed\" }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        { \"container\": \"hand_right\", \"contents\": [\"Broken Tutorial Sword\"], \"location\": \"arm_right\" },\n        { \"container\": \"hand_left\", \"contents\": [\"Participation Trophy\"], \"location\": \"arm_left\" },\n        { \"container\": \"body\", \"contents\": [\"Linen Tunic\"], \"location\": \"torso\" },\n        { \"container\": \"pockets\", \"contents\": [\"Single Copper Coin\"], \"location\": \"legs\" }\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie is perfecting the art of the 'System-Logic' bluff to survive high-level encounters.\",\n        \"Artie is increasingly paranoid about his 1 HP vulnerability.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_VANE\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 8,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        { \"container\": \"sheath\", \"item\": \"Masterwork Rapier\", \"status\": \"stowed\" },\n        { \"container\": \"shoulders\", \"item\": \"Silk Cloak\", \"status\": \"equipped\" }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        { \"container\": \"sheath\", \"contents\": [\"Masterwork Rapier\"], \"location\": \"belt_left\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_VANE\" }\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Vane is obsessed with 'System Balance' and views anomalies as bugs to be patched.\",\n        \"Vane is intrigued and threatened by Artie's claimed 'Perfect Guard' build.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie was confronted by the Paladin Vane outside the Mayor's office.\",\n      \"Vane challenged Artie to a duel to verify his 'Statistical Anomaly' status and 100% Crit rate.\",\n      \"Artie successfully bluffed that his 1 HP was a 'Perfect Guard' reflection build, causing Vane to stand down.\",\n      \"Artie escaped the encounter and began heading toward the Low-Level Crypts to find better gear.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Met Vane (Lvl 28 Paladin) in the Oakhaven government hall.\",\n      \"Vane initiated a Duel Request which Artie declined via a psychological bluff.\",\n      \"Reinforced the 'Perfect Guard' lie to explain the 1 HP stat.\",\n      \"Established THREAD_VANE_RIVALRY as Vane promised to monitor Artie for 'System instability'.\",\n      \"Artie's hunger and stamina reached critical low levels.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"milestone: variance_tax_imposed = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: vane_first_encounter = DONE\",\n      \"status: bluffed_perfect_guard = ACTIVE\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Participation Trophy (carried, container=hand_left)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Broken Tutorial Sword (carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_VANE -> Masterwork Rapier (carried, container=sheath)\",\n      \"Artie has 1 HP and 100% Crit Rate.\",\n      \"Artie's Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit is on a 24-hour cooldown.\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Artie has bluffed his way past both the Mayor and the city's highest-ranking Paladin.\",\n      \"Vane has been established as a primary antagonist who views Artie as a 'virus' in the System.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"threads_touched\": [\"THREAD_VANE_RIVALRY\", \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"]\n}",

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nMechanics contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and labels (stats/skills) must be sourced from state or explicitly updated in the state_patch. Do not invent numbers or canonical tokens.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the RNG-Hellscape\",\"goal\":\"Introduce Artie and his
