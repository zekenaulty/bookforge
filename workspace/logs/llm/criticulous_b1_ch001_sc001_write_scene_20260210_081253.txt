PROSE:

The bag of Zesty Nacho rings dangled from the metal coil like a traitorous mountaineer clinging to a cliff face by a single, oily thread. It didn't move. It didn't even tremble. It just hung there, mocking Arthur Penhaligon with its crinkly, air-filled promise of a mid-afternoon reprieve.

"You’ve got to be kidding me," Artie muttered, his voice echoing in the sterile, fluorescent-lit vacuum of the Breakroom. 

[Sanity: 14/100]

He looked down at his left hand, where the last of his Loose Change had just been sacrificed to the mechanical maw of the Vending Machine 3000. On his right, he clutched his Leather Wallet with a grip that was probably doing permanent damage to the cowhide. He’d been in this office for nine hours. Nine hours of Level 4 Data Entry. Nine hours of watching spreadsheets scroll past his retinas like a digital fever dream.

[Skill Check: Sarcasm (Level 10) - Success!]

"Oh, great. The machine is on a diet. How noble of you to save me from three hundred calories of processed corn meal and red dye forty," Artie snapped. 

The machine didn't respond. It just hummed, a low-frequency vibration that seemed designed to specifically aggravate the part of the human brain responsible for impulse control. Artie adjusted his Silk Tie. It felt like a silken noose today, tighter than usual, strangling the life out of his Tuesday.

[Sanity: 12/100]

He checked his Leather Wallet. Empty of coins. He had a twenty-dollar bill tucked inside, but the machine’s 'Exact Change Only' light was blinking with the rhythmic insistence of a strobe light at a funeral. 

"Listen, you heap of scrap," Artie said, leaning his forehead against the cool, scratched glass. "I just want the chips. I’ve put in the work. I’ve entered the data. I’ve been a good little cog in the corporate machine. Just let go of the bag."

The coil didn't budge. In fact, it seemed to settle deeper into its refusal. Artie’s eye twitched. This was the pinnacle of his existence. This was the final boss of his thirty-two years on Earth: a malfunctioning snack dispenser with a vendetta.

[Sanity: 5/100]

[Warning: Sanity Critical. Impulsive Actions Likely.]

Artie didn't need a system notification to tell him he was about to do something stupid. He could feel it in the way his heart hammered against his ribs. He stepped back, the linoleum squeaking under his sensible office shoes, and delivered a sharp, frustrated kick to the base of the machine.

Nothing.

He grabbed the sides of the Vending Machine 3000 and began to shake. "Give. Me. My. Chips!"

The machine groaned. Inside, the bag of Zesty Nacho rings finally began to tilt. It was working. Gravity, the only law Artie still respected, was taking over. But as the machine rocked back on its heels, a strange sound began to emanate from its rear—a sound like a thousand angry hornets trapped in a copper pipe.

[Environmental Hazard Detected: Faulty Grounding]

Artie didn't see the frayed power cord. He didn't see the puddle of spilled coffee that had seeped under the machine’s rear left foot, creating a perfect, liquid bridge between the high-voltage internal capacitors and the metal chassis he was currently white-knuckling.

"Wait, what is that smel—"

A flash of blue-white light erupted from the coin slot. 

[HP: 10/10]

The surge didn't just hit him; it used him as a highway. Artie’s Silk Tie stood on end, a vertical monument to his impending demise. His Leather Wallet flew from his hand as his muscles spasmed with the force of a thousand suns. The Loose Change inside the machine’s coin return melted instantly.

[Critical Failure: Electrical Grounding]
[Damage: 9999 (Overkill)]

[HP: 0/10]

Artie’s last thought wasn't about his unfinished spreadsheets or his lack of a retirement plan. It was the fact that, as he fell backward, the bag of Zesty Nacho rings finally tumbled off the coil and landed softly on the bottom flap.

Then, the breakroom dissolved. The fluorescent lights didn't just go out; they unraveled. The walls peeled away like burnt paper, revealing a vast, echoing darkness that smelled faintly of ozone and static.

[System Initializing...]
[Welcome, User: PENHALIGON_A]
[Status: Deceased (Technicality)]
[Redirecting to Character Creation Void...]

Artie felt himself floating. There was no floor, no ceiling, only a shimmering UI that began to coalesce in front of his non-existent eyes. The silence was absolute, broken only by the rhythmic blinking of a cursor.
