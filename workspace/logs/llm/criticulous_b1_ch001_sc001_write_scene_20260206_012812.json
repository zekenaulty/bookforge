It flickered, a rhythmic strobe that turned the beige walls and the crusty microwave into a low-budget horror set. Arthur Penhaligon\u2014Artie to the three people who didn't call him 'Hey, You'\u2014stared at the Snack-O-Matic 3000 with the intensity of a man contemplating regicide.\n\nBehind the scratched plexiglass, a single bag of 'Nacho Average Jalape\u00f1o' chips dangled by a literal plastic hair. The metal coil had completed its rotation, but the bag had defied the laws of gravity, physics, and basic human decency. It hung there, mocking him, a buck-fifty investment suspended in a bureaucratic limbo that mirrored Artie\u2019s entire existence.\n\n\"Are you kidding me?\" Artie muttered. His voice was raspy from eight hours of explaining to Mrs. Gable why her internet didn't work when she unplugged the router to vacuum. \"It\u2019s a bag of chips. It\u2019s air and corn dust. Just fall.\"\n\nHe shifted his weight, and the weight of his cargo shifted with him. In his right hand, Artie gripped the hilt of a 'Rusty Shortsword.' It wasn't actually metal, or at least not the kind that could hold an edge. It was high-density foam coated in a realistic, weathered latex, a prop for the 'Kingdoms of Kaladar' LARP event he was supposed to be driving to the moment his shift ended. His manager, a man whose personality was best described as 'lukewarm mayonnaise,' had already given him a thirty-minute lecture about 'professionalism in the workspace' when he\u2019d seen the sword leaning against Artie's cubicle. \n\nArtie hadn't cared. He didn't care about the spreadsheets, the 'synergy' meetings, or the way the office coffee tasted like a blend of charcoal and despair. He only cared about getting to the woods, putting on his tabard, and pretending, for forty-eight hours, that he wasn't a cog in a machine that was desperately in need of oil.\n\nBut now, the machine was winning.\n\n\"E-4,\" Artie whispered, his finger hovering over the keypad. \"I paid for E-4.\"\n\nHe looked down at his right hand. The foam sword felt absurd in the sterile light of the breakroom, but it was the only thing he owned that felt real. His smartphone was a dead brick in his pocket, its battery drained by a day of scrolling through forums to avoid looking at his inbox. His wallet was equally light, containing exactly three dollars\u2014half of which was currently tied up in the Jalape\u00f1o hostage situation.\n\nHe reached out with his left hand and gave the vending machine a tentative shove. The Snack-O-Matic 3000 didn't budge. It was a heavy, industrial beast, bolted to the floor as if the company feared someone might actually try to steal the stale granola bars.\n\n\"Come on, you bucket of bolts. Work with me.\"\n\nArtie leaned his shoulder into the machine, his right hand still white-knuckled around the LARP sword. He could see his reflection in the plexiglass: a man in his late twenties with dark circles under his eyes and a haircut that screamed 'I gave up in 2019.' He looked like a background character in a movie about a guy who has a much more interesting life.\n\nHe gave the machine a harder shake. This time, the coil rattled. The bag of chips swayed. For a glorious second, it looked like it might drop. Then, it settled back into its precarious perch, more stuck than before.\n\n\"That\u2019s it,\" Artie snapped. The last thread of his patience, frayed by a thousand 'per my last email's, finally snapped. \"I am not losing a dollar-fifty to a machine that hasn't been cleaned since the Clinton administration.\"\n\nHe dropped into a crouch, peering into the delivery bin at the bottom. The flap was heavy plastic, spring-loaded to prevent 'theft.' Artie knew the legend: if you reached up far enough, you could sometimes jar the coils. It was a move born of desperation and hunger, a low-level exploit in the game of office survival.\n\nHe shoved his left arm into the bin, the plastic teeth of the flap biting into his forearm. He reached upward, his fingers straining toward the dangling chips. \n\n\"Just... one... nudge...\"\n\nHis right hand, the one holding the Rusty Shortsword, braced against the side of the machine for leverage. He didn't notice the frayed power cord snaking out from the back of the Snack-O-Matic, where the insulation had been rubbed raw by years of being shoved against the wall. He didn't see the small pool of water from the leaking industrial fridge nearby that had crept toward the machine's base.\n\nAs Artie lunged upward, trying to hook the bag with his fingernails, his sword\u2014specifically the metallic-painted crossguard which, unknown to Artie, contained a very real, very conductive steel core for structural integrity\u2014slid into a gap in the machine\u2019s metal casing.\n\nThe world didn't end with a bang. It ended with a *hum*.\n\nA massive, bone-shaking vibration surged up Artie\u2019s right arm. It wasn't just a shock; it was a hostile takeover. His muscles clamped shut, his hand fusing to the hilt of the sword, which was now acting as a perfect bridge between the building's faulty wiring and his own nervous system. \n\nBlue sparks danced across the plexiglass, illuminating the 'Nacho Average Jalape\u00f1o' chips in a ghostly, electric glow. Artie tried to scream, but his jaw was locked in a grimace of pure, unadulterated agony. His vision began to pixelate. Not in the metaphorical sense\u2014literal squares of color began to drop out of his field of vision, replaced by a flat, void-like black.\n\n*Seriously?* he thought, the last coherent spark of his mind flickering with typical snark. *Killed by a vending machine? This is the most Artie way to go.*\n\nThe smell of ozone and burning polyester filled the air. The humming grew louder, reaching a crescendo that sounded suspiciously like a dial-up modem trying to connect to the afterlife. \n\nThen, the chips fell. \n\nThe bag hit the bottom of the bin with a soft *thud* that Artie didn't hear.\n\nThe world went dark. The hum faded into a profound, ringing silence.\n\nArtie felt... nothing. No pain, no floor beneath his feet, no weight of the sword in his hand. He was suspended in a place that wasn't a place, a vast expanse of nothingness that felt strangely like a computer screen before the BIOS loads.\n\nA single line of text appeared in the center of the void. It was neon green and pulsed with a steady, digital heartbeat.\n\n[Initializing... System Version 4.02.b]\n\n\"Oh, you've got to be kidding me,\" Artie said. Or thought. He wasn't sure if he had a mouth anymore. \"I\u2019m in a LitRPG? I died for a bag of chips and now I\u2019m a protagonist?\"\n\n[Scanning Bio-Data...

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the RNG-Hellscape\",\"goal\":\"Introduce Artie and his

I checked the floating red bar hovering above its translucent, jiggly head. \n\n[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 3] [HP: 45/45]\n\nForty-five health. At my current Strength of 12, with a base weapon damage of 4-6, I was looking at a nine-hit kill minimum, assuming the RNG gods didn't decide to spit on my shoes today. \n\n\"You know,\" I said, adjusting my grip on the rusted shortsword. \"In most worlds, puddles are for stepping in, not for getting dissolved by.\"\n\nThe slime responded by launching a glob of corrosive mucus. I rolled left, the grass staining my knees.\n\n[Stamina: 88/100]\n\n\"Missed me. Barely. That\u2019s a three-second cooldown on your spit, isn't it?\"\n\nI didn't wait for the confirmation. I lunged. The blade sank into the gelatinous mass with a sound like a heavy boot pulling out of thick mud.\n\n[Critical Hit! -14 HP]\n\n\"There we go.

My lungs burned slightly, a reminder that my Agility was still garbage. \n\n[Passive Skill Gained: Basic Analysis (Rank F)]\n[Description: You can see basic stats and cooldowns of enemies within 5 meters. You\u2019ve stopped guessing and started counting. Good for you.]\n\n\"Finally,\" I breathed, dodging another glob. \"The ding is coming. I can practically taste the experience points. They taste like copper and bad decisions.\" \n\nI swung again, the numbers popping in the air like neon confetti. This wasn't just a fight; it was a grind.
