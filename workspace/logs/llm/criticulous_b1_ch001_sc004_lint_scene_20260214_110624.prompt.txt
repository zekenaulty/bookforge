﻿# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
Prose hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative ("left hand", "right hand", "Artie", "his wallet").
Item naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.
Appearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Continuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.
UI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says "always include".
Continuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.
Durable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.
JSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.
Inventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true. If a prior invariant is stale or superseded, you MUST flag it for removal using "REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>" before restating the current truth.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.
Durable vs ephemeral mechanics:
- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.
- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.
- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).
- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.
For durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
For durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).
Use canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.

- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.
  - INVALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": {"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}
  - VALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": [{"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}]


USER:

# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Classify UI/prose mechanic claims as DURABLE or EPHEMERAL before enforcing.
  - DURABLE: persistent stats/caps, skills/titles acquired, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, named mechanics referenced as invariants.
  - EPHEMERAL: roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat telemetry.
- Enforce DURABLE claims against authoritative_surfaces/state/registries.
- EPHEMERAL claims do not require state ownership; only flag EPHEMERAL contradictions inside the same scene as warnings.
- UI gate:
  - If scene_card.ui_allowed=false and any authoritative UI blocks appear, emit issue code 'ui_gate_violation' (severity depends on lint mode).
  - If ui_allowed is missing and UI blocks appear, emit 'ui_gate_unknown' (warning) requesting explicit ui_allowed; do not fail solely for missing flag.
  - Inline bracketed UI (e.g., [HP: 1/1]) is still UI and should be gated the same way; do not embed UI mid-sentence.
- If uncertain, default to EPHEMERAL (warning at most), not DURABLE (error).
- status="fail" only if there is at least one issue with severity="error"; warnings alone => status="pass".
- Item naming enforcement scope:
  - Do not require that every mention in narrative prose use display_name.
  - Enforce canonical display_name for: (a) anchoring at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences),
    (b) any custody-change sentence (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer), and (c) any case where a descriptor is ambiguous among multiple durable items in the scene.
  - Otherwise, treat non-canonical descriptive references as warnings at most.
- Prose hygiene: flag internal ids or container codes in narrative prose (CHAR_, ITEM_, THREAD_, DEVICE_, hand_left, hand_right).
- Naming severity policy:
  - warning: unambiguous descriptor used post-anchor.
  - error: missing anchor, descriptor used during custody-change without canonical name, or ambiguity risk.

- Appearance enforcement (authoritative surface):
  - APPEARANCE_CHECK is authoritative for cast_present_ids.
  - Compare APPEARANCE_CHECK tokens to appearance_current atoms/marks (alias-aware).
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK contradicts appearance_current, emit error code "appearance_mismatch".
  - Prose-only appearance contradictions are warnings unless explicitly durable and uncorrected in-scene.
  - If prose depicts a durable appearance change but scene_card.durable_appearance_changes does not include it and no appearance_updates are present, emit error code "appearance_change_undeclared".
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK is missing for a cast member, emit warning code "appearance_check_missing".
- For authoritative surfaces, prefer exact canonical item/device labels from registries.
- For milestone repetition/future checks, compare against PRE-INVARIANTS only (pre-scene canon).
- For ownership/consistency checks, compare against POST-STATE (post-patch candidate).
- POST-STATE is canonical; character_states is a derived convenience view. If they contradict, emit pipeline_state_incoherent.
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).
  - Ignore first-person pronouns inside quoted dialogue; only narration counts.
- Deterministically enforce scene-card durable constraints (required_in_custody, required_scene_accessible, forbidden_visible, device_presence; optional required_visible_on_page).
- Durable constraint evaluation must use POST-STATE candidate (after patch), not pre-state.
- Report missing durable context ids with explicit retry hints instead of guessing canon.
- Input consistency check (mandatory, before issuing continuity/durable errors):
  - If MUST_STAY_TRUE invariants contradict the provided post-patch candidate character state, treat this as an upstream snapshot error.
  - In that case emit a single error issue with code "pipeline_state_incoherent" including evidence of the invariant and the conflicting state field.
  - Do NOT emit additional continuity errors for the same fields when pipeline_state_incoherent is present.
- must_stay_true removals:
  - Lines starting with "REMOVE:" are deletion directives, not invariants.
  - Ignore REMOVE lines when checking contradictions.
  - If a REMOVE directive targets a fact, treat that fact as non-canonical even if it appears earlier in must_stay_true.
- If pipeline_state_incoherent is present, issues MUST contain exactly one issue.
- For each issue, include evidence when possible (line number + excerpt) as {"evidence": {"line": N, "excerpt": "..."}}.
- Evaluate consistency over the full scope of the scene, not a single snapshot.
  - Transitional state: a temporary mismatch later corrected or superseded within this scene.
  - Durable violation: a mismatch that persists through the end of the scene or ends unresolved.
  - You MUST read the entire scene and build a minimal timeline of explicit state claims/updates (UI lines, inventory changes, title/skill changes, location/time claims).
  - If you detect an apparent inconsistency, you MUST search forward for later updates that resolve or supersede it.
  - Only produce FAIL for durable violations. If resolved within the scene, do NOT FAIL; at most emit a warning.
  - When the same stat appears multiple times, the last occurrence in the scene is authoritative unless an explicit rollback is stated.
  - Any durability violation must cite both the conflicting line and the lack of later correction (or state "no later correction found").

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity
- evidence

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The Lesser Green Slime didn’t just lunge; it performed a gravitational insult. 

It was a wobbling mass of translucent, neon-citrus phlegm that had spent the last thirty seconds cornering me against a jagged outcrop of rock. Now, it was mid-air, a "Tutorial Slam" in progress, and my entire life—all twenty-eight years of spreadsheets, lukewarm coffee, and that final, fatal argument with a vending machine—was about to be ended by a sentient puddle.

[Warning: Incoming Damage - 4 (Lethal)]
[Current HP: 1/1]
[Status: Glass Soul (Active)]

"Not like this," I wheezed, my lungs still feeling like they’d been scrubbed with steel wool from the electrocution. "I am not dying to a dessert topping."

I threw myself to the right. It wasn't a graceful roll. It was a panicked, flailing collapse that sent me face-first into the vibrant, glowing grass. The slime hit the rock behind me with a wet *thwack*, the sound of a giant steak being dropped onto a tile floor. 

I scrambled to my feet, my heart hammering against my ribs. The Corporate ID Badge clipped to my lanyard swung wildly, the plastic edge catching me in the chin. I ignored it. I didn't have a sword. I didn't even have a sharpened pencil. I had two fists that had never hit anything harder than a 'Caps Lock' key.

"Okay, Artie. Math. Focus on the math," I muttered. My hazel eyes darted around the Slime Fields, looking for an exit, but the creature was already re-inflating itself for another go. "I have a hundred percent crit rate. That has to mean something, right? If I hit it, it breaks."

The slime jiggled. It looked like it was laughing.

I stepped forward, trying to channel every action movie I’d ever seen. I pulled my right fist back, my keyboard-calloused palm sweating, and launched a punch that I intended to be a jaw-shattering hook.

[Attack Initiated: Unarmed Strike]
[Accuracy Check: 12% (Poor Form)]

I swung so hard I actually spun. My fist whistled through the air, missing the slime’s core by a good six inches. The momentum carried me past the creature, and I nearly tripped over my own feet.

[Miss #1: Over-extension]

"Calibration," I gasped, spinning back around. "Just a calibration swing."

The slime bobbed. It seemed to be waiting for me. I lunged again, this time with a straight jab. I kept my eyes open for approximately half a second before the sheer terror of the creature’s undulating surface made me flinch. My arm went limp, and I basically just waved at the monster.

[Miss #2: Flinch Reflex]

"Stop looking at me like that!" I yelled at the slime. It didn't have eyes, but I could feel the judgment radiating from its gelatinous bulk. 

I tried a double-handed shove, hoping to at least knock it back. I stepped into the neon-green slime trail it had left behind. My left foot went north, my right foot went nowhere, and I performed a frantic, mid-air dance that ended with me slapping the air where the slime had been a second ago.

[Miss #3: Environmental Slip]

The slime shifted, its core—a dark, pea-sized nucleus—pulsing with a faint light. It was preparing another slam. I was running out of rock to hide behind and running out of dignity to lose.

"Third time's the charm? No, that was three. Fourth! Fourth is... statistically significant!"

I charged. This wasn't a punch. This was a desperate, eyes-closed flail. I swung my left arm in a wide arc, my fist aimed at the center of the mass. The slime simply compressed itself, the top of its head dipping just low enough that my knuckles scraped over the top of its sticky skin without actually registering a hit.

[Miss #4: Target Compression]

I was panting now. My slender frame wasn't built for this. My Corporate ID Badge was tangled in my shirt, and I could feel the weight of my Smartphone and Leather Wallet in my pockets, dragging at my trousers. Every movement felt sluggish, like I was trying to fight underwater.

The slime launched. It was a low-altitude glide, aimed straight for my chest.

"Get! Away!" I screamed, throwing a frantic kick. 

I missed. Not just the slime, but the ground. I overcompensated for the creature's movement, my leg sailing through empty space, and I landed hard on my backside.

[Miss #5: Total Balance Failure]

The slime landed inches from my crotch, its surface vibrating with the intensity of a subwoofer. It was over. I was on the ground, 1 HP, and the tutorial monster was ready to deliver the final 'Tutorial Slam'.

[System Notification: Combat Efficiency < 0.01%]
[System Query: Would you like to enable 'Toddler Mode'? (Y/N)]

"Screw you," I hissed at the floating text. 

The slime reared back, expanding to twice its size. It was a wall of green death. I didn't have time to stand. I didn't have time to aim. I just reached out with my right hand—the one with the keyboard callus—and gave the slime a weak, pathetic shove, as if I were trying to move a slightly annoying person out of my way at the deli counter.

It was the most half-hearted attack in the history of the multiverse.

[Attack Initiated: Pathetic Shove]
[Accuracy Check: ...Calculating...]
[Glitch Detected: Statistical Inevitability Triggered]
[Critical Hit! (100% Rate Guaranteed)]

The moment my palm touched the slime’s surface, the world didn't just stop; it stuttered. 

The neon-green grass turned into a smear of static. The air smelled suddenly of burnt silicon and ozone. A sound like a thousand glass windows shattering at once erupted from the point of contact. 

[Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit!]
[Damage Calculation: 1.2e+12]
[Overkill Calculator: 9,999,999,999% Efficiency]

A pillar of white, blinding light erupted from my hand. It didn't just hit the slime; it erased it. The Lesser Green Slime didn't pop or splatter; it simply ceased to be. The light continued, a horizontal spear of pure mathematical fury that tore through the Slime Fields. 

Twenty feet behind where the slime had been, a massive, ancient-looking oak tree stood. Or it had stood. The beam of the crit hit the trunk, and the tree didn't fall. It disintegrated. The wood turned to ash, then the ash turned to light, and then there was just a perfectly circular hole where a forest giant had been a second ago.

The shockwave knocked me backward, my head ringing. I scrambled away from the smoking line of scorched earth that now cut through the tutorial zone. 

[System Notification: Enemy Deleted.]
[Calculating Experience...]
[Error: Experience exceeds local buffer. Truncating...]
[Level Up!]
[Level Up!]

I stared at the crater. A single, charred leaf drifted down from the sky, landing on my nose.

[Status Update: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[Level: 2]
[HP: 1/1 (Glass Soul)]
[Crit Rate: 100% (Anomaly)]

"I... I think I broke the tutorial," I whispered, my voice cracking.

I looked down at my hand. It was perfectly fine. No burns, no scratches. Just the same faint keyboard callus I’d had since college. But where the slime had been, there was now a smoking, blackened pit in the earth, and the smell of ozone was thick enough to taste.

[Title Progress: 'One-Hit Wonder' - 1/10]
[System Note: Please try to leave some of the environment for the other players. This is a shared space.]

I sat there for a long time, the Corporate ID Badge finally coming to a rest against my chest. I was Level 2. I was alive. And I was officially the most dangerous thing in this world—mostly because I had no idea what I was doing.
