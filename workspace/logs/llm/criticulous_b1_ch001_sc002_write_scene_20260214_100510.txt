PROSE:

The transition from "being electrocuted by a Snack-o-Matic" to "floating in an infinite white void" was surprisingly smooth, mostly because Artie’s brain was still trying to process the smell of burnt ozone and Cool Ranch seasoning. 

He looked down. His Corporate ID Badge, still dangling from its lanyard, was slightly melted at the edges. The blue plastic housing was warped, a permanent souvenir of the arc that had stopped his heart. He patted his sides. The Smartphone was still in his left pocket, and the Leather Wallet was tucked into his right. He was dead, but apparently, he’d brought his middle-management starter kit with him.

"Oh, good. You’re awake," a voice chirped. It sounded like a bell being struck by a very sarcastic hammer. "I was worried I’d have to start the tutorial with a corpse. That’s always such a paperwork nightmare."

Artie spun around—or tried to. In the absence of gravity, he mostly just kicked his legs like a panicked turtle. 

A small, glowing blue sprite hovered a few feet away. She had spiky neon blue hair and a pair of translucent wings that left trails of pixelated dust in the air. On her left wing, a tiny system version tattoo read *v4.2*.

"Who—what are you?" Artie gasped.

"I’m Fizz," the sprite said, crossing her arms. "Your Tutorial Guide. And you are Arthur Penhaligon, deceased data analyst and current candidate for the 'Not Totally Useless' program. Welcome to the System. Try not to leak on the floor; the graphics are still rendering."

[System Notification: Character Initialization in Progress...]
[Player: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[Status: Deceased (Pending Respawn)]

A translucent blue screen snapped into existence between them. It was covered in sliders, bar graphs, and more math than Artie usually dealt with on a Tuesday morning.

"Okay, Artie. We need to allocate your starting points," Fizz said, zooming in close to his face. "Since you died in a way that the System describes as 'statistically hilarious,' you’ve been granted a Bonus Anomaly Pool. Fifty points. Don't spend them all in one place, or do. I'm a guide, not your mother."

Artie squinted at the screen. He saw the usual suspects: Strength, Agility, Intelligence. But at the very bottom, highlighted in a flickering, glitchy gold, was a stat labeled 'Critical Hit Rate.'

"What's that one?" Artie asked, pointing.

"That? Oh, that’s the 'Luck is for Losers' stat," Fizz said, buffing her nails on her glowing blue skin. "Usually, it’s capped at five percent for beginners. But since you’re an Anomaly, the cap is... well, it’s missing. Probably a bug. I should report it."

"Missing?" Artie’s inner data analyst perked up. He looked at the 50 points. Then he looked at his current HP.

[HP: 1/10 (Critical Condition)]

"I should probably put points into HP, right?" Artie asked. "I feel a bit... fragile."

"Boring," Fizz yawned. "You put points into HP, you become a tank. You know what tanks do? They get hit. A lot. Do you like getting hit, Artie? You look like the kind of guy who apologizes to the sidewalk when he trips."

Artie ignored the insult. He was looking at the math. If he put all 50 points into Critical Hit Rate, and the conversion ratio was 2% per point...

"Wait. If I dump everything into Crit, I hit 100%," Artie whispered. "Every hit is a crit."

"And every hit against you will probably turn you into a fine red mist," Fizz added helpfully. "Because you'll have the durability of a wet paper towel. You’re at 1 HP, Artie. The System is holding you together with digital duct tape right now."

Artie looked at the 'Confirm' button. He looked at the flickering gold stat. His life had been a series of safe bets, spreadsheets, and lukewarm coffee. And it had ended because of a bag of chips.

"If I'm going to be a glass cannon," Artie said, his finger hovering over the screen, "I might as well be the glassiest, cannon-iest thing in the world."

He dragged the slider. All fifty points vanished into Critical Hit Rate.

[Warning: Stat Allocation Imbalance Detected!]
[Warning: Constitution falling below minimum safety thresholds!]
[Condition 'Glass Soul' Applied: HP locked at 1.]

"Artie, wait—" Fizz started, her eyes widening.

Artie slammed his palm onto the 'Confirm' button.

The white void suddenly turned a violent, neon red. A siren-like whine filled his ears, and the screen in front of him began to fracture like a broken monitor.

[System Overload! Recalculating...]
[Anomaly Detected: '100% Critical Hit Rate' achieved at Level 1.]
[Title Unlocked: Crit or Quit]
[Title Effect: All outgoing damage is guaranteed to be a Critical Hit. All incoming damage is guaranteed to be fatal.]

"You absolute moron," Fizz breathed, her wings fluttering at double speed. "You actually did it. You locked it in."

Artie felt a strange, humming vibration in his chest, right where the electrical burns were. He felt light. Too light. Like he was made of glass and lightning.

"Does this mean I win?" Artie asked.

"This means," Fizz said, her expression shifting from horror to a wicked, pixelated grin, "that if a stray breeze hits you, you’re going to explode. But until then? You’re going to be the biggest headache this System has ever seen."

[Character Build Finalized.]
[HP: 1/1]
[Crit Rate: 100%]
[Respawning in Tutorial Zone: The Slime Fields...]

"Wait, Slime Fields?" Artie yelled as the white void began to dissolve into green pixels. "Are they aggressive? Fizz! Are the slimes aggressive?"

"Only if they have eyes, Artie!" Fizz’s voice echoed as she faded into a streak of blue light. "Good luck! Try not to die in the first five seconds! It ruins my stats!"

The world rushed in—the smell of damp grass, the heat of a digital sun, and the very rhythmic, very wet sound of something jiggly approaching.
