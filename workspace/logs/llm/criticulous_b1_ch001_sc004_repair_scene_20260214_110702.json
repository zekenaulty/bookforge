Now, it was mid-air, a \"Tutorial Slam\" in progress, and Artie\u2019s entire life\u2014all twenty-eight years of spreadsheets, lukewarm coffee, and that final, fatal argument with a vending machine\u2014was about to be ended by a sentient puddle. The world around him, the Slime Fields, was a nauseating palette of oversaturated greens and purples, smelling faintly of sugar and ozone.\n\n[Warning: Incoming Damage - 4 (Lethal)]\n[Current HP: 1/1]\n[Status: Glass Soul (Active)]\n\n\"Not like this,\" Artie wheezed, his lungs still feeling like they\u2019d been scrubbed with steel wool from the electrocution that had sent him here. \"I am not dying to a dessert topping.\"\n\nHe threw himself to the right. It wasn't a graceful roll. It was a panicked, flailing collapse that sent his slender frame face-first into the vibrant, glowing grass. The slime hit the rock behind him with a wet *thwack*, the sound of a giant steak being dropped onto a tile floor. The impact was so heavy it sent a tremor through the ground, vibrating up through Artie's pale chest where the severe electrical burns still throbbed with a phantom heat.\n\nArtie scrambled to his feet, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird. The Corporate ID Badge clipped to his lanyard swung wildly, the plastic edge catching him in the chin with a sharp, annoying sting. He ignored it. He didn't have a sword. He didn't even have a sharpened pencil. He had two fists that had never hit anything harder than a 'Caps Lock' key. His mousy brown hair was matted with sweat and bits of neon grass, and his hazel eyes darted around the clearing, looking for an exit that wasn't blocked by undulating gelatin.\n\n\"Okay, Artie. Math. Focus on the math,\" he muttered, trying to steady his breathing. The creature was already re-inflating itself, its core\u2014a dark, pea-sized nucleus\u2014pulsing with a rhythmic, predatory light. \"I have a hundred percent crit rate. That has to mean something, right? If I hit it, it breaks. It\u2019s basic logic. It\u2019s an if-then statement.\"\n\nThe slime jiggled. It looked like it was laughing, or perhaps just settling its internal mass for another strike.\n\nArtie stepped forward, trying to channel every action movie he\u2019d ever seen during his lunch breaks. He pulled his right fist back, his keyboard-calloused palm sweating, and launched a punch that he intended to be a jaw-shattering hook.\n\n[Attack Initiated: Unarmed Strike]\n[Accuracy Check: 12% (Poor Form)]\n\nHe swung so hard he actually spun. His fist whistled through the air, missing the slime\u2019s core by a good six inches. The momentum carried him past the creature, and he nearly tripped over a protruding root.\n\n[Miss #1: Over-extension]\n\n\"Calibration,\" Artie gasped, spinning back around and nearly losing his balance again. \"Just a calibration swing. Establishing the parameters.\"\n\nThe slime bobbed, its surface shimmering under the artificial-looking sun of the tutorial zone. It seemed to be waiting for him, mocking his lack of coordination. Artie lunged again, this time with a straight jab. He kept his eyes open for approximately half a second before the sheer terror of the creature\u2019s undulating, translucent surface made him flinch. His arm went limp, and he basically just waved at the monster.\n\n[Miss #2: Flinch Reflex]\n\n\"Stop looking at me like that!\" Artie yelled. The slime didn't have eyes, but he could feel the judgment radiating from its gelatinous bulk. It was the same look his manager used to give him when a pivot table collapsed. \n\nHe tried a double-handed shove, hoping to at least knock the thing back and buy some space. He stepped into the neon-green slime trail the creature had left behind. His left foot went north, his right foot went nowhere, and he performed a frantic, mid-air dance that ended with him slapping the air where the slime had been a second ago.\n\n[Miss #3: Environmental Slip]\n\nThe slime shifted, its core pulsing faster now. It was preparing another slam. Artie was running out of rock to hide behind and running out of dignity to lose. The weight of the Smartphone and Leather Wallet in his pockets felt like lead weights, dragging at his trousers as he struggled to regain his footing.\n\n\"Third time's the charm? No, that was three. Fourth! Fourth is... statistically significant!\"\n\nHe charged. This wasn't a punch. This was a desperate, eyes-closed flail. He swung his left arm in a wide arc, his fist aimed at the center of the mass. The slime simply compressed itself, the top of its head dipping just low enough that Artie's knuckles scraped over the top of its sticky skin without actually registering a hit.\n\n[Miss #4: Target Compression]\n\nArtie was panting now, his slender frame reaching its limit. His Corporate ID Badge was tangled in his shirt, the lanyard choking him slightly. Every movement felt sluggish, like he was trying to fight through a vat of cold syrup. The system was watching, he knew. It was recording every failure, every pathetic gasp for air.\n\nThe slime launched. It was a low-altitude glide, aimed straight for his chest.\n\n\"Get! Away!\" Artie screamed, throwing a frantic kick. \n\nHe missed. Not just the slime, but the ground. He overcompensated for the creature's movement, his leg sailing through empty space, and he landed hard on his backside. The impact jarred his spine, sending a jolt of pain through his pale skin.\n\n[Miss #5: Total Balance Failure]\n\nThe slime landed inches from his crotch, its surface vibrating with the intensity of a subwoofer. It was over. Artie was on the ground, 1 HP, and the tutorial monster was ready to deliver the final 'Tutorial Slam'. The air was thick with the scent of citrus-flavored doom.\n\n[System Notification: Combat Efficiency < 0.01%]\n[System Query: Would you like to enable 'Toddler Mode'? (Y/N)]\n\n\"Screw you,\" Artie hissed at the floating text, his hazel eyes narrowing with a sudden, sharp spark of spite. \n\nThe slime reared back, expanding to twice its size. It was a wall of green death, a wobbling executioner. Artie didn't have time to stand. He didn't have time to aim. He didn't have time to think about form or accuracy or the fact that he was about to die to a level one mob. He just reached out with his right hand\u2014the one with the keyboard callus\u2014and gave the slime a weak, pathetic shove, as if he were trying to move a slightly annoying person out of his way at the deli counter.\n\nIt was the most half-hearted attack in the history of the multiverse.\n\n[Attack Initiated: Pathetic Shove]\n[Accuracy Check: ...Calculating...]\n[Glitch Detected: Statistical Inevitability Triggered]\n[Critical Hit! (100% Rate Guaranteed)]\n\nThe moment Artie's palm touched the slime\u2019s surface, the world didn't just stop; it stuttered. \n\nThe neon-green grass turned into a smear of static. The air smelled suddenly of burnt silicon and high-voltage discharge. A sound like a thousand glass windows shattering at once erupted from the point of contact, a cacophony of breaking code and shattered physics. \n\n[Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit!]\n[Damage Calculation: 1.2e+12]\n[Overkill Calculator: 9,999,999,999% Efficiency]\n\nA pillar of white, blinding light erupted from Artie's hand. It didn't just hit the slime; it erased it. The Lesser Green Slime didn't pop or splatter; it simply ceased to be, its data overwritten by a surge of pure mathematical fury. The light continued, a horizontal spear of radiance that tore through the Slime Fields with the force of a collapsing star. \n\nTwenty feet behind where the slime had been, a massive, ancient-looking oak tree stood. Or it had stood. The beam of the crit hit the trunk, and the tree didn't fall. It disintegrated. The wood turned to ash, then the ash turned to light, and then there was just a perfectly circular hole where a forest giant had been a second ago. The ground beneath the beam's path was scorched into a glass-like trench.\n\nThe shockwave knocked Artie backward, his head ringing with a high-pitched whine. He scrambled away from the smoking line of scorched earth that now cut through the tutorial zone, his eyes wide with terror and awe. \n\n[System Notification: Enemy Deleted.]\n[Calculating Experience...]\n[Error: Experience exceeds local buffer. Truncating...]\n[Level Up!]\n\nArtie stared at the crater. A single, charred leaf drifted down from the sky, landing on his nose. He brushed it off with a trembling hand, looking down at his palm. It was perfectly fine. No burns, no scratches. Just the same faint keyboard callus he\u2019d had since college. But where the slime had been, there was now a smoking, blackened pit in the earth, and the smell of ozone was thick enough to taste.\n\n[Status Update: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]\n[Level: 2]\n[HP: 1/1 (Glass Soul)]\n[Crit Rate: 100% (Anomaly)]\n\n\"I... I think I broke the tutorial,\" Artie whispered, his voice cracking.\n\nHe sat there for a long time, the Corporate ID Badge finally coming to a rest against his chest. He was Level 2. He was alive. And he was officially the most dangerous thing in this world\u2014mostly because he had no idea how to stop what he had just started. The Slime Fields were quiet now, the remaining slimes having retreated into the tall grass, seemingly aware that the rules of their world had just been violently rewritten.\n\n[Title Progress: 'One-Hit Wonder' - 1/10]\n[System Note: Please try to leave some of the environment for the other players. This is a shared space.]\n\nArtie looked at the smoking hole in the tree and then back at his hand. The spreadsheet wizardry of his old life felt like a distant, dusty memory compared to the raw, glitchy power he now held. He wasn't just a player anymore; he was a walking error message.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_ARTIE\"\n    ],\n

I think I broke the tutorial,\" Artie whispered, his voice cracking.\n\nHe sat there for a long time, the Corporate ID Badge finally coming to a rest against his chest. He was Level 2. He was alive. And he was officially the most dangerous thing in this world\u2014mostly because he had no idea how to stop what he had just started. The Slime Fields were quiet now, the remaining slimes having retreated into the tall grass, seemingly aware that the rules of their world had just been violently rewritten.\n\n[Title Progress: 'One-Hit Wonder' - 1/10]\n[System Note: Please try to leave some of the environment for the other players. This is a shared space.]\n\nArtie looked at the smoking hole in the tree and then back at his hand. The spreadsheet wizardry of his old life felt like a distant, dusty memory compared to the raw, glitchy power he now held. He wasn't just a player anymore; he was a walking error message.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_ARTIE\"\n    ],\n

    "system": "\ufeff# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nUI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says \"always include\".\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true. If a prior invariant is stale or superseded, you MUST flag it for removal using \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" before restating the current truth.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v2\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\":

        "content": "# REPAIR\n\nFix the scene based on lint issues.\nSummaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\nTimeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: pre-scene invariants and summary facts are binding unless the Scene Card depicts a change. If this scene changes a durable fact, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value and remove the old entry.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n\n- must_stay_true removal (mandatory when a durable fact is superseded):\n  - Add \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" in summary_update.must_stay_true.\n  - Place REMOVE lines before the new final invariant.\n  - REMOVE lines also apply to key_facts_ring (purge stale facts from continuity).\n\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- Inventory posture reconciliation:\n  - If inventory/containers change (held/stowed/container), must_stay_true must be updated to the final posture.\n  - Add REMOVE lines for prior inventory/container invariants before the new final entries.\n  - Use canonical invariant formats:\n    - inventory: CHAR_X -> <item display_name> (status=held|carried|equipped|stowed, container=hand_left|hand_right|<container>)\n    - container: <container> (owner=CHAR_X, contents=[<item display_name>, ...])\nFor held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\nContinuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.\n- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.\n- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.\n- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI gate: only include bracketed UI blocks when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If false, remove or rephrase UI blocks into narrative prose.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or a short parenthetical annotation (e.g., (locked), (Warning: ...)).\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nCanonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\nIf item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for authoritative labels and custody terms.\nUse item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If a durable appearance change occurs in this scene, record it in character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- APPEARANCE_CHECK is required in COMPLIANCE for each cast_present_id (4-8 tokens from atoms/marks).\n\nNaming repairs:\n- If lint flags an item naming issue, fix it with minimal edits.\n- Do not remove humor; simply anchor the item (add display_name near first mention) and ensure custody-change sentences include the display_name.\n- Do not rename item_id or registry fields; only adjust prose wording.\nsummary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\nSTATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\nmust_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\nIf state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\nEnforce scene-card durable constraints: `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\nRespect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`.\n\n- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):\n  - If timeline_scope != \"present\" OR ontological_scope != \"real\", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).\n  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.\n  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category=\"timeline_override\".\n\nReturn corrected prose plus a corrected state_patch JSON block.\n\nOutput format (required, no code fences, no commentary):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n\nAPPEARANCE_CHECK:\n- CHAR_ID: <4-8 tokens from atoms/marks>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects.

Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_device_id, replacement_of.\n  - custodian must be a non-null string id/scope (character id or \"world\"). Never use null.\n    - INVALID: \"custodian\": null\n    - VALID: \"custodian\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\" or \"world\"\n  - owner_scope must be \"character\" or \"world\" and must match the custodian scope.\n  - plot_device_updates: set must include name, custody_scope, custody_ref, activation_state, linked_threads, constraints, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n\n- Transfer vs registry conflict rule (must follow):\n  - If you create a NEW item in item_registry_updates with final custodian already set (e.g., CHAR_ARTIE), DO NOT emit transfer_updates for that item.\n  - If you emit transfer_updates for a NEW item, the registry entry must start with custodian=\"world\" and then transfer to the character.\n  - expected_before must match the registry entry at the moment of transfer (after any registry update that applies before it).  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects;

Now, it was mid-air, a \"Tutorial Slam\" in progress, and my entire life\u2014all twenty-eight years of spreadsheets, lukewarm coffee, and that final, fatal argument with a vending machine\u2014was about to be ended by a sentient puddle.\n\n[Warning: Incoming Damage - 4 (Lethal)]\n[Current HP: 1/1]\n[Status: Glass Soul (Active)]\n\n\"Not like this,\" I wheezed, my lungs still feeling like they\u2019d been scrubbed with steel wool from the electrocution. \"I am not dying to a dessert topping.\"\n\nI threw myself to the right. It wasn't a graceful roll. It was a panicked, flailing collapse that sent me face-first into the vibrant, glowing grass. The slime hit the rock behind me with a wet *thwack*, the sound of a giant steak being dropped onto a tile floor. \n\nI scrambled to my feet, my heart hammering against my ribs. The Corporate ID Badge clipped to my lanyard swung wildly, the plastic edge catching me in the chin. I ignored it. I didn't have a sword. I didn't even have a sharpened pencil. I had two fists that had never hit anything harder than a 'Caps Lock' key.\n\n\"Okay, Artie. Math. Focus on the math,\" I muttered. My hazel eyes darted around the Slime Fields, looking for an exit, but the creature was already re-inflating itself for another go. \"I have a hundred percent crit rate. That has to mean something, right? If I hit it, it breaks.\"\n\nThe slime jiggled. It looked like it was laughing.\n\nI stepped forward, trying to channel every action movie I\u2019d ever seen. I pulled my right fist back, my keyboard-calloused palm sweating, and launched a punch that I intended to be a jaw-shattering hook.\n\n[Attack Initiated: Unarmed Strike]\n[Accuracy Check: 12% (Poor Form)]\n\nI swung so hard I actually spun. My fist whistled through the air, missing the slime\u2019s core by a good six inches. The momentum carried me past the creature, and I nearly tripped over my own feet.\n\n[Miss #1: Over-extension]\n\n\"Calibration,\" I gasped, spinning back around. \"Just a calibration swing.\"\n\nThe slime bobbed. It seemed to be waiting for me. I lunged again, this time with a straight jab. I kept my eyes open for approximately half a second before the sheer terror of the creature\u2019s undulating surface made me flinch. My arm went limp, and I basically just waved at the monster.\n\n[Miss #2: Flinch Reflex]\n\n\"Stop looking at me like that!\" I yelled at the slime. It didn't have eyes, but I could feel the judgment radiating from its gelatinous bulk. \n\nI tried a double-handed shove, hoping to at least knock it back. I stepped into the neon-green slime trail it had left behind. My left foot went north, my right foot went nowhere, and I performed a frantic, mid-air dance that ended with me slapping the air where the slime had been a second ago.\n\n[Miss #3: Environmental Slip]\n\nThe slime shifted, its core\u2014a dark, pea-sized nucleus\u2014pulsing with a faint light. It was preparing another slam. I was running out of rock to hide behind and running out of dignity to lose.\n\n\"Third time's the charm? No, that was three. Fourth! Fourth is... statistically significant!\"\n\nI charged. This wasn't a punch. This was a desperate, eyes-closed flail. I swung my left arm in a wide arc, my fist aimed at the center of the mass. The slime simply compressed itself, the top of its head dipping just low enough that my knuckles scraped over the top of its sticky skin without actually registering a hit.\n\n[Miss #4: Target Compression]\n\nI was panting now. My slender frame wasn't built for this. My Corporate ID Badge was tangled in my shirt, and I could feel the weight of my Smartphone and Leather Wallet in my pockets, dragging at my trousers. Every movement felt sluggish, like I was trying to fight underwater.\n\nThe slime launched. It was a low-altitude glide, aimed straight for my chest.\n\n\"Get! Away!\" I screamed, throwing a frantic kick. \n\nI missed. Not just the slime, but the ground. I overcompensated for the creature's movement, my leg sailing through empty space, and I landed hard on my backside.\n\n[Miss #5: Total Balance Failure]\n\nThe slime landed inches from my crotch, its surface vibrating with the intensity of a subwoofer. It was over. I was on the ground, 1 HP, and the tutorial monster was ready to deliver the final 'Tutorial Slam'.\n\n[System Notification: Combat Efficiency < 0.01%]\n[System Query: Would you like to enable 'Toddler Mode'? (Y/N)]\n\n\"Screw you,\" I hissed at the floating text. \n\nThe slime reared back, expanding to twice its size. It was a wall of green death. I didn't have time to stand. I didn't have time to aim. I just reached out with my right hand\u2014the one with the keyboard callus\u2014and gave the slime a weak, pathetic shove, as if I were trying to move a slightly annoying person out of my way at the deli counter.\n\nIt was the most half-hearted attack in the history of the multiverse.\n\n[Attack Initiated: Pathetic Shove]\n[Accuracy Check: ...Calculating...]\n[Glitch Detected: Statistical Inevitability Triggered]\n[Critical Hit! (100% Rate Guaranteed)]\n\nThe moment my palm touched the slime\u2019s surface, the world didn't just stop; it stuttered. \n\nThe neon-green grass turned into a smear of static. The air smelled suddenly of burnt silicon and ozone. A sound like a thousand glass windows shattering at once erupted from the point of contact. \n\n[Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit!]\n[Damage Calculation: 1.2e+12]\n[Overkill Calculator: 9,999,999,999% Efficiency]\n\nA pillar of white, blinding light erupted from my hand. It didn't just hit the slime; it erased it. The Lesser Green Slime didn't pop or splatter; it simply ceased to be. The light continued, a horizontal spear of pure mathematical fury that tore through the Slime Fields. \n\nTwenty feet behind where the slime had been, a massive, ancient-looking oak tree stood. Or it had stood. The beam of the crit hit the trunk, and the tree didn't fall. It disintegrated. The wood turned to ash, then the ash turned to light, and then there was just a perfectly circular hole where a forest giant had been a second ago.\n\nThe shockwave knocked me backward, my head ringing. I scrambled away from the smoking line of scorched earth that now cut through the tutorial zone. \n\n[System Notification: Enemy Deleted.]\n[Calculating Experience...]\n[Error: Experience exceeds local buffer. Truncating...]\n[Level Up!]\n[Level Up!]\n\nI stared at the crater. A single, charred leaf drifted down from the sky, landing on my nose.\n\n[Status Update: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]\n[Level: 2]\n[HP: 1/1 (Glass Soul)]\n[Crit Rate: 100% (Anomaly)]\n\n\"I... I think I broke the tutorial,\" I whispered, my voice cracking.\n\nI looked down at my hand. It was perfectly fine. No burns, no scratches. Just the same faint keyboard callus I\u2019d had since college. But where the slime had been, there was now a smoking, blackened pit in the earth, and the smell of ozone was thick enough to taste.\n\n[Title Progress: 'One-Hit Wonder' - 1/10]\n[System Note: Please try to leave some of the environment for the other players. This is a shared space.]\n\nI sat there for a long time, the Corporate ID Badge finally coming to a rest against my chest. I was Level 2. I was alive. And I was officially the most dangerous thing in this world\u2014mostly because I had no idea what I was doing.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\":
