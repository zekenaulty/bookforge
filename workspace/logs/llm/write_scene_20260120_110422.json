  "text": "The first shadow-form didn't emerge from the darkness; it tore itself out of the violet-stained glass three paces to Kaelen's left. It rose with a sound like a wet whetstone against a blade\u2014a long, agonizing screech of friction. It had no face, only a vertical slit of deeper void that seemed to pull the surrounding light into a screaming vortex.\n\nKaelen\u2019s hand went to the hilt of his longsword, but his fingers were already numb. The cold wasn't coming from the valley air. It was radiating outward from the radius bone of his right arm, where the pewter filament of his Starwrought Oath lay fractured. The shard in his satchel thrummed in a synchronized, sickening rhythm with the marrow-bound thread. \n\n*Thump-hiss.*\n\nThe shadow-form lunged. It didn't run; it glided, its base blurring into the jagged floor of the crater. \n\nKaelen pivoted, his boots skidding on the razor-edged obsidian. He didn't draw his steel\u2014not yet. Against the Void-touched, cold iron was little more than a suggestion. He reached inward, grasping for the tattered ends of his Oath. \n\nThe reaction was instantaneous and brutal. As he channeled the intent to repel, the pewter filament in his forearm buckled. He felt the metal grind against the interior of his bone, a dry, splintering sensation that forced a gasp of scorched air from his lungs. The scent of ozone and old copper filled his nose, sharp enough to make his eyes water.\n\nA burst of necrotic purple light flared from his palm, jagged and unstable. It struck the shadow-form mid-lunge. The creature didn't shatter; it dissolved into a cloud of oily soot that smelled of stagnant water and burnt hair. \n\nKaelen fell to one knee, his right arm shaking. The skin above the radius bone was already turning a translucent, waxy white\u2014the first sign of frost-burn. The price of the Starwrought magic was always physical, but with the Oath fractured, the exchange rate had become ruinous. \n\n\"Not here,\" he hissed, the words puffing out in a cloud of silver vapor. \"I won't die in a hole of my own making.\"\n\nMore shapes were rising. Three, then five, pulling themselves out of the impact fissures like oil seeping through cracks in a floor. They moved with a predatory grace that mocked the clumsy, glass-stiffened movements of a man. The star-shard in his satchel grew warmer, its rhythmic pulse accelerating. It wasn't just a relic; it was a beacon, and every Void-touched thing in the valley was answering the call.\n\nHe stood, forcing his legs to lock. He needed to reach the crater\u2019s rim. The walls were a treacherous incline of flash-melted silica, sharp enough to flay a man to the bone if he slipped. \n\nThe second shadow-form circled to his right, its form flickering like a dying candle. Kaelen drew his blade this time, more for the weight and the reach than the edge. He lashed out, the steel passing through the creature\u2019s chest with no resistance. The shadow-form rippled, then elongated, a limb of pure darkness whipping toward his throat.\n\nHe threw up his right arm in a desperate block. The shadow struck the bracer, and the contact sent a jolt of absolute zero through his marrow. The pewter filament didn't just vibrate; it shrieked. \n\nA wave of white-hot frost erupted from the fracture point. It blasted outward in a radial arc, catching the shadow-form and two others behind it. They froze mid-motion, turned into brittle statues of dark ice before shattering into a thousand glittering shards.\n\nKaelen\u2019s vision blurred. His lungs felt as though he\u2019d swallowed a handful of needles. The metallic tang of magic was so thick now he could taste it on the back of his tongue\u2014bitter, like a rusted coin. He looked down at his arm. The sleeve of his tunic was scorched away, and the skin was mapped with fine, dark veins that pulsed with a faint, dying violet light.\n\nThe remaining shadows hesitated, their vertical maws twitching. They sensed the instability of the power he was wielding. It was a weapon that was killing its wielder as surely as it was destroying them.\n\nKaelen didn't wait for them to regroup. He turned and began the scramble up the crater wall. \n\nThe glass was worse than he\u2019d feared. It wasn't just sharp; it was brittle. Every handhold was a gamble. He jammed his gloved fingers into a crevice, feeling the leather slice open instantly. Blood, dark and steaming in the cold, slicked the obsidian. He ignored the sting, hauling himself upward. \n\nBelow him, the shadow-forms began to climb. They didn't need handholds. They flowed up the vertical surfaces like ink spilled on a tilted page. \n\nHe reached a narrow ledge halfway to the rim and spun around. His breath was coming in ragged, shallow gulps. The shard in his bag was vibrating so hard it was rattling his ribs. \n\n\"You want it?\" Kaelen roared, his voice cracking. \"Come and take the rest of me!\"\n\nHe slammed his right palm against the glass ledge. He didn't try to shape the magic this time. He simply let the fractured Oath bleed. \n\nThe result was a catastrophic discharge. A pillar of violet fire erupted from the ledge, fueled by the marrow of his bone and the resonance of the star-shard. The shockwave threw Kaelen backward, his head slamming against the rock as the ledge disintegrated. \n\nThe scream of the shadow-forms was a sound of collapsing stars. The violet light consumed them, scouring the crater wall clean of the void-taint for a fleeting, brilliant second.\n\nKaelen lay on a higher shelf of rock, his world reduced to a dull roar and the smell of his own scorched hair. His right arm was dead weight, a frozen limb of marble and agony. But the rhythmic *thump-hiss* of the shard had slowed. The immediate pursuit was gone, silenced by the sheer violence of the Oath\u2019s failure.\n\nHe rolled onto his stomach, his fingers clawing at the dirt of the rim. He pulled himself over the edge, away from the glass and the violet glow. The Silver Valley lay behind him, a sea of shattered mirrors. Ahead, the dark silhouettes of the High Spire\u2019s ruins beckoned, a skeletal reminder of the duty he had already failed.\n\nHe forced himself to his feet, cradling his ruined arm. He was alive, but the pewter thread in his bone felt thin\u2014as if the next time he called upon it, it might simply dissolve into dust.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_kaelen\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"Silver Valley - Crater Rim\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Kaelen survived the first skirmish with the Void-touched shadow-forms using a violent discharge of his fractured Oath-magic.\",\n      \"The shadow-forms are drawn to the star-shard's light and move with liquid, predatory grace.\",\n      \"Kaelen's right arm has sustained significant frost-burn and physical damage to the pewter filament within the radius bone.\",\n      \"The star-shard reacts to Kaelen's magic, acting as a catalyst that increases the power and the physical cost of his spells.\",\n      \"Kaelen has successfully ascended out of the impact crater and is moving toward the ruins of the High Spire.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_starfall_corruption\",\n      \"THREAD_oath_binding\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Kaelen was ambushed by shadow-forms at the center of the impact crater.\",\n      \"He repelled the entities using a series of agonizing, unstable bursts of Starwrought magic that further damaged his physical Oath.\",\n      \"He successfully scaled the glass-choked walls of the crater and escaped the immediate pursuit, though his body is severely taxed.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Shadow-forms (Void-touched) emerged from the glass fissures to hunt the star-shard.\",\n      \"Kaelen experienced the extreme physical cost of using a fractured Oath, including frost-burn and scorched lungs.\",\n      \"The pewter filament in Kaelen's radius bone suffered structural grinding and vibration during magic use.\",\n      \"Kaelen used a massive, unshaped discharge of star-light to destroy the pursuing shadows and clear a path.\",\n      \"Kaelen reached the rim of the crater, injured but in possession of the shard.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"The Starwrought Oath is a physical pewter filament in the radius bone.\",\n      \"Magic use causes frost-burn, metallic scents (copper/ozone), and scorched lungs.\",\n      \"The star-shard and the Oath-filament share a rhythmic, pulsing connection.\",\n      \"Void-touched shadow-forms are light-drinking entities that displace the air.\",\n      \"Kaelen's right arm is currently semi-functional and heavily damaged by frost-burn.\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Kaelen secured the star-shard but was immediately attacked by void-entities.\",\n      \"He narrowly escaped the impact crater by over-extending his fractured magical abilities.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",

Your writing is characterized by a tight, limited third-person perspective that never breaks into omniscient narration. You must maintain strict continuity, ensuring that characters utilize their full range of established skills and knowledge. Do not use 'As you know' dialogue or provide summaries of previous events. When a scene begins, drop the reader directly into the character's current sensory experience. Avoid clich\u00e9s in descriptions; instead of 'cold as ice,' describe the 'brittle, biting snap of air that makes the lungs ache.' Ensure all plot payoffs are seeded with subtle clues in earlier movements. Magic and high-fantasy elements must have clear costs and logical consistency.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"The Silver Fracture\",\"goal\":\"Witness the starfall and establish Kaelen's failing

Every step through the knee-deep peat required a deliberate shift of weight, a calculated gamble against the suction of the black mud. To rush was to sink; to hesitate was to let the stinging gnats find the gaps in the leather greaves.\n\nThe silver needle of the compass didn\u2019t spin; it shuddered, vibrating with a frequency that numbed the thumb pressing against the casing. This wasn't the erratic jitter of a magnetic anomaly, but the rhythmic, heavy thrum of a tethered ley-line. It pulled at the marrow, a dull ache in the long bones that signaled the proximity of a ruptured seal. The price of such proximity was always paid in blood-sugar and breath; the lungs felt scorched, as if the very oxygen had been thinned by the invisible pressure.\n\nA jagged obsidian shard protruded from a stump of petrified oak. It didn't just sit in the light; it seemed to drink it, casting a shadow that fell toward the sun rather than away. Touching it would be a mistake\u2014the last time a finger had brushed a similar fracture, the skin had turned the color of a bruised plum and stayed cold for a week. Instead, the focus remained on the tension of the wire stretched across the path, nearly invisible against the gray mist. It was set at mid-thigh height, weighted with a lead sinker to ensure it wouldn't flutter in the wind. A simple trap, but one that required a steady hand and a sharp eye to bypass without tripping the chime hidden in the hollow log nearby. The world didn't offer warnings, only consequences recorded in the stiffness of joints and the steady, rhythmic thud of a heart working too hard against a thinning atmosphere.\n\nState:\n{\n
