Weave a narrative rich with subtle foreshadowing and intricate plot threads, ensuring that major reveals feel earned and are judiciously hinted at throughout the text. Maintain a mythic and epic tone through descriptive language and thematic depth. Develop complex, morally ambiguous characters alongside clear heroes and villains, exploring their internal conflicts and motivations. Integrate world-building seamlessly, avoiding direct info-dumps. Vary sentence structure and pacing, using longer, flowing sentences for description and shorter, impactful ones for tension and revelation. Avoid deus ex machina, predictable character arcs, and simplistic moral resolutions. Focus on creating a layered reading experience where the importance of minor details becomes clear in surprising, satisfying ways, rewarding attentive readers.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\n",
