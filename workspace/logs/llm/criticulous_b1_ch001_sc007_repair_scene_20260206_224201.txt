PROSE:
The Mayor’s office in Oakhaven didn't just smell like power; it smelled like high-resolution rendering and expensive, micro-transactional wax. The walls were lined with shelves of leather-bound ledgers that Artie suspected were actually just physical manifestations of the town’s database. Behind a desk carved from a single, massive block of Obsidian-Oak—a material that looked like it had a very high damage threshold—sat the Mayor.

Artie stood on the plush, crimson carpet, feeling every bit the level-one glitch he was. His right hand was white-knuckled around the hilt of the Broken Tutorial Sword. It was a pathetic weapon, little more than a jagged shard of iron, but it was the only thing between him and the terrifyingly polished reality of this room. In his left hand, the Participation Trophy pulsed with a rhythmic, sickly neon light. The "Aura of the Beacon" was currently making the shadows in the corners of the room vibrate with a low-frequency hum that Artie was pretty sure was the sound of every monster in a five-mile radius checking their GPS.

The Mayor of Oakhaven was a man whose character model was clearly set to 'Opulent.' He wore a silver chain of office that shimmered with a constant stream of scrolling data: [Level 42], [Social Standing: Exalted], [Current Mood: Opportunistic]. He didn't look at Artie; he looked at the space six inches above Artie’s head where his name and title floated.

"Statistical Anomaly," the Mayor whispered, the words sounding like a cash register opening. "The gate scanner hasn't thrown a Fatal Error like that since the Great Patch of '04. Do you have any idea what you are, Mr. Penhaligon?"

"A guy who really needs a chair and maybe a sandwich?" Artie suggested.

[Status: Winded (Recovery Rate -50%)]

The hunger bar in the corner of his vision was flickering a threatening shade of orange, a pixelated stomach growling for sustenance. He kept his posture straight, despite the fact that his legs felt like they were made of overcooked noodles. In a world where a stiff breeze could deplete his entire 1 HP health pool, looking like a "glass cannon" was a tactical necessity. Looking like "shattered glass" was an invitation for the Mayor to sweep him into a dustpan.

"You are a walking mint," the Mayor said, standing up. He rounded the desk, his eyes locked on Artie’s character sheet—or at least the parts the System hadn't redacted with "Error 404" messages. "A 100% Critical Hit rate. Do you understand the economic implications? Most artisans spend decades trying to reach a five-percent 'Masterwork' proc rate. You? You could tap a piece of raw iron and it would come out a Vorpal Blade just because the System doesn't know how to roll a 'normal' result for you."

Artie tightened his grip on the Broken Tutorial Sword. "I'm more of a 'vaporize the tutorial wolf' kind of guy. I don't do much blacksmithing. Mostly because I don't have a hammer. Or a forge. Or any health."

"You will," the Mayor countered, a predatory smile stretching his cheeks. "Oakhaven is a hub of commerce, and commerce requires stability. Your presence is... unstable. Therefore, the municipal code requires a 'Variance Tax' for all anomalies of Tier 3 or higher. It’s for the safety of the server, you understand."

[System Notification: New Quest Offered - The Mayor’s Cut]
[Objective: Pay 500 Gold in 'Variance Taxes' or provide 10 pieces of 'Crit-Forged' equipment.]
[Reward: Citizenship, 500 XP, 1x 'Safe Zone' voucher.]
[Failure: Immediate deportation to the 'Unpatched Wilds'.]

"Five hundred gold?" Artie barked, the Participation Trophy nearly slipping from his left hand. "I have exactly one copper coin and a trophy that makes me a magnet for everything with teeth. I'm not a bank, I'm a target."

The Mayor leaned in, his Level 42 aura pressing against Artie like a physical weight. It was a passive intimidation check, and Artie could feel his 1 HP vibrating in protest. The Mayor’s left hand rested on his Town Seal, a heavy golden stamp that looked like it could deal at least 10-15 blunt damage—more than enough to delete Artie ten times over.

"Then you'd better start swinging that broken toothpick of yours at something valuable," the Mayor said. "Or perhaps, I could 'invest' in your potential. A small contract. You provide Oakhaven with a guaranteed 'Crit-Output' for our local guild, and I overlook the fact that your HP is..." He paused, squinting at the blurred red bar above Artie's head. "Well, it’s remarkably low, isn't it? One might almost say it's a rounding error. A single point?"

Artie’s heart hammered against his ribs. This was the moment. If the Mayor realized that Artie was a literal one-hit-point wonder, the negotiation was over. The Mayor wouldn't tax him; he’d harvest him like a rare crafting node.

"It's a specialized build," Artie lied, his voice dropping into a low, confident register. He channeled every tech support agent he’d ever argued with. "The System balances the 100% Crit by compressing my health into a 'Perfect Guard' state. I don't need HP if I never get hit. It’s a high-level optimization. And trust me, you don't want to see what happens when the 'Reflect' damage procs on a 100% Crit build. The last thing that touched me turned into a pile of unformatted metadata."

It was total nonsense—a bluff built on the shaky foundation of the System's own bad math. But the Mayor hesitated. In this world, the weirdest builds were often the most dangerous, and "Perfect Guard" sounded like the kind of broken mechanic a developer would forget to patch.

"A bold claim," the Mayor muttered, stepping back and removing his hand from the Town Seal. "But a Statistical Anomaly is, by definition, an unknown variable. I’ll give you twenty-four hours to find a way to pay that tax, Penhaligon. Until then, you are a guest of Oakhaven. But remember: in this town, we don't worship the gods. We worship the roll. And right now? Your rolls are the only thing keeping you from being recycled into raw data."

Artie turned to leave, the Participation Trophy’s neon glow illuminating the Mayor’s greedy expression. As the heavy oak doors clicked shut behind him, Artie let out a breath he didn't know he was holding. He was still holding the Broken Tutorial Sword in his right hand, his knuckles finally beginning to regain their color.

He was in. He was safe—for now. But the end condition of his stay was clear. He wasn't just a player anymore; he was a walking jackpot. And in a town full of gamblers, someone was eventually going to try and pull the lever.

"Fizz," Artie whispered to the empty air, "we need to find a way to turn 'breaking the game' into 'paying the rent' before that guy decides to check my 'Perfect Guard' with a crossbow."
