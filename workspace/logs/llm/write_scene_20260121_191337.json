  "text": "PROSE:\n\nThe floor of the Inner Sanctum didn't just tilt; it shrieked, a tectonic groan of marble shearing away from the Spire\u2019s central spine. Kaelen slammed his boots against the base of a heavy oak lectern, his right arm vibrating with a frequency that threatened to liquefy the marrow. The pewter filament woven into his radius bone ground against the inner surface of the cortex, a rhythmic, white-hot agony that mirrored the *thump-hiss* of the star-shard in his satchel.\n\nAcross the sloping chamber, Commander Varkas stood at an impossible angle. He wasn't bracing himself. He was anchored by the bruised violet light bleeding from the fracture in his chest, his boots fused to the stone by crystalline growths. The man who had taught Kaelen the first tenets of the Oath was gone, replaced by a hollowed-out vessel of star-glass and void-shadow. Varkas\u2019s eyes were no longer human; they were twin pits of violet event horizons, swirling with the same sickly luminescence that had turned the valley floor to razor-glass.\n\n\"The maps, Kaelen,\" Varkas said. His voice was a discordant harmony, two tones overlapping\u2014one familiar and gravelly, the other a high, crystalline chime. \"Leave them. The stars do not need to be charted. They need to be felt.\"\n\nVarkas raised a hand. The air in the sanctum turned brittle, the temperature plummeting until Kaelen\u2019s breath came in ragged, frozen puffs that scorched his throat. A lash of violet energy whipped across the room, shattering the remaining display cases. Kaelen dived behind the central archive table, the scent of scorched copper and ozone filling his lungs. \n\nHe reached into his satchel, his fingers brushing the star-shard. The moment of contact sent a jolt of ice-water through his nervous system. The shard didn't just pulse; it pulled. It wanted the corruption in Varkas. It wanted to consume the very thing that had hollowed out his commander.\n\n\"You're not him,\" Kaelen hissed, his teeth aching from the cold. \"Varkas died when the first ward broke.\"\n\n\"Varkas was a jailer,\" the thing in the commander's skin replied. \"I am the key.\"\n\nThe table between them disintegrated. Not into splinters, but into fine, violet dust that hung in the air, defiant of gravity. Kaelen lunged forward, his boots skidding on the frost-slicked marble. He drew his short-blade, but he didn't aim for the heart. He knew there was nothing left there but glass. He aimed for the throat, for the place where the pewter filament of Varkas\u2019s own Oath-binding was visible beneath the translucent, purple-veined skin.\n\nVarkas moved with a fluid, terrifying speed, his arm snapping out to catch Kaelen\u2019s wrist. The contact was like grabbing a frozen iron bar. Frost-burn bloomed instantly across Kaelen\u2019s forearm, the skin turning the color of a bruised plum. \n\nKaelen roared, not in pain, but in a desperate attempt to force the shard\u2019s resonance through his own arm. He opened the gates of his Oath, letting the unstable essence of the star-shard flood the pewter filament in his bone. The reaction was violent. A metallic scent, sharp and biting, filled the air as the filament heated to a dull glow. \n\nThe resonance clash sent a shockwave through the room. The stained-glass windows above the archives exploded outward, the shards caught in the Spire's tilting gravity and pulled into the abyss below. Varkas recoiled, his violet eyes flickering. For a second, the commander\u2019s true face surfaced\u2014a mask of absolute, unadulterated terror.\n\n\"Kaelen... stop...\"\n\n\"I can't,\" Kaelen choked out, his lungs feeling as if they were filled with liquid lead. \"The Oath is broken, Commander. You broke it.\"\n\nKaelen twisted the blade, the edge catching on the crystalline growths on Varkas\u2019s chest. He didn't pull back. He pushed. He drove the shard\u2019s hunger directly into the commander\u2019s core. The *thump-hiss* reached a deafening crescendo, a rhythmic thrumming that shook the very foundations of the Spire.\n\nVarkas\u2019s body began to fracture. Lines of brilliant, blinding violet light spiderwebbed across his skin. The star-glass in his chest hummed, then shattered. The explosion wasn't outward, but inward\u2014a sudden, violent vacuum that pulled the air from Kaelen\u2019s lungs and the light from the room. \n\nVarkas collapsed, his form dissolving into a heap of dull, gray ash and jagged violet shards. The pressure in the room vanished, replaced by the howling wind of the storm outside. \n\nKaelen slumped against the archive rack, his right arm hanging limp and blackened by starwrought scarring. His breath hitched, each inhale a battle against the frost-burn in his chest. He couldn't stay. The floor gave another sickening lurch, the angle now so steep that the heavy archive racks began to slide toward the shattered windows.\n\nHe scrambled toward the central dais. There, inside a reinforced brass cylinder etched with the constellations of the Old Era, lay the Star-Maps. He grabbed the cylinder, the metal freezing to his palm, and shoved it into his satchel alongside the pulsing shard. \n\nThe Spire groaned one last time\u2014a final, terminal sound of structural failure. The ceiling began to rain dust and debris. Kaelen didn't look back at the remains of his commander. He turned toward the archway leading to the outer battlements, his boots finding purchase on the crumbling stone as he began a desperate, uphill sprint toward the only exit left.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_kaelen\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"High Spire - Inner Sanctum (Collapsing)\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Kaelen killed the corrupted Commander Varkas by overloading his internal star-glass with shard resonance.\",\n      \"Kaelen secured the Star-Maps in their brass cylinder.\",\n      \"Varkas's body dissolved into ash and violet shards upon death.\",\n      \"Kaelen suffered significant frost-burn and starwrought scarring on his right arm during the duel.\",\n      \"The High Spire is undergoing final structural collapse.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_oath_binding\",\n      \"THREAD_starfall_corruption\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Kaelen engaged in a lethal duel with the corrupted Commander Varkas within the collapsing Inner Sanctum.\",\n      \"Using the resonance of the star-shard, Kaelen shattered Varkas's internal star-glass, killing him and dissolving his form.\",\n      \"Kaelen secured the Star-Maps and began a desperate escape toward the battlements as the Spire reached its tipping point.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Kaelen confronts the transformed Commander Varkas in the tilting sanctum.\",\n      \"The duel involves a violent resonance clash between Kaelen's shard and Varkas's corruption.\",\n      \"Kaelen experiences severe physical costs, including frost-burn and scorched lungs, from channeling shard essence.\",\n      \"Varkas is killed, his body reduced to ash and glass fragments.\",\n      \"Kaelen retrieves the Star-Maps from the archive dais.\",\n      \"Kaelen flees the Inner Sanctum as the Spire begins its final descent into the void.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"Magic use causes physical frost-burn, scorched lungs, and metallic scents.\",\n      \"The Starwrought Oath is a physical pewter filament in the radius bone.\",\n      \"The starfall corruption is characterized by violet light and a 'thump-hiss' resonance.\",\n      \"Kaelen's right arm bears black, starwrought scarring from the shard's integration.\",\n      \"The High Spire is in a state of catastrophic, terminal collapse.\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Kaelen killed his corrupted commander, Varkas, in the Inner Sanctum.\",\n      \"Kaelen secured the Star-Maps, the only key to understanding the starfall.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",

Your writing is characterized by a tight, limited third-person perspective that never breaks into omniscient narration. You must maintain strict continuity, ensuring that characters utilize their full range of established skills and knowledge. Do not use 'As you know' dialogue or provide summaries of previous events. When a scene begins, drop the reader directly into the character's current sensory experience. Avoid clich\u00e9s in descriptions; instead of 'cold as ice,' describe the 'brittle, biting snap of air that makes the lungs ache.' Ensure all plot payoffs are seeded with subtle clues in earlier movements. Magic and high-fantasy elements must have clear costs and logical consistency.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"The Silver Fracture\",\"goal\":\"Witness the starfall and establish Kaelen's failing

}\n]\n\nStyle anchor:\nThe scent of scorched copper clung to the back of the throat, thick enough to mask the underlying rot of the marsh. Every step through the knee-deep peat required a deliberate shift of weight, a calculated gamble against the suction of the black mud. To rush was to sink; to hesitate was to let the stinging gnats find the gaps in the leather greaves.\n\nThe silver needle of the compass didn\u2019t spin; it shuddered, vibrating with a frequency that numbed the thumb pressing against the casing. This wasn't the erratic jitter of a magnetic anomaly, but the rhythmic, heavy thrum of a tethered ley-line. It pulled at the marrow, a dull ache in the long bones that signaled the proximity of a ruptured seal. The price of such proximity was always paid in blood-sugar and breath; the lungs felt scorched, as if the very oxygen had been thinned by the invisible pressure.\n\nA jagged obsidian shard protruded from a stump of petrified oak. It didn't just sit in the light; it seemed to drink it, casting a shadow that fell toward the sun rather than away. Touching it would be a mistake\u2014the last time a finger had brushed a similar fracture, the skin had turned the color of a bruised plum and stayed cold for a week. Instead, the focus remained on the tension of the wire stretched across the path, nearly invisible against the gray mist. It was set at mid-thigh height, weighted with a lead sinker to ensure it wouldn't flutter in the wind. A simple trap, but one that required a steady hand and a sharp eye to bypass without tripping the chime hidden in the hollow log nearby. The world didn't offer warnings, only consequences recorded in the stiffness of joints and the steady, rhythmic thud of a heart working too hard against a thinning atmosphere.\n\nState:\n{\n
