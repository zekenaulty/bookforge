PROSE:
Artie’s lungs felt like they had been scrubbed with industrial-grade sandpaper and then set on fire. Every breath was a jagged reminder that a Dexterity score of two—even with the "Pity Bonus" he’d clawed out of the System’s cold, dead hands—was not built for a cross-country sprint. He scrambled over a moss-covered log, his right hand white-knuckling the Broken Tutorial Sword while his left hand remained fused to the glowing, golden weight of the Participation Trophy.

[Stamina: 9/100]
[Status: Winded (Recovery Rate -50%)]

"Faster, Artie! It’s gaining! And by 'it,' I mean the entire local ecosystem!" Fizz hovered alongside him, her wings a blur of cyan pixels. She wasn't running, of course. She was a guide. She just floated there, looking professionally concerned while Artie did all the dying.

Behind them, the Level 4 Tutorial Wolf let out a howl that sounded less like a predator and more like a dial-up modem screaming at a wall. It wasn't just the wolf. Thanks to the gold-plated monstrosity fused to Artie's left hand, he had a trail of angry slimes, two disgruntled squirrels, and a very confused-looking badger following him like he was the messiah of the misunderstood. The physical contact with the trailing edge of a Level 1 Slime—a sticky, acidic sensation against his heel—finally snapped as he put on a desperate burst of speed.

The Participation Trophy hummed. It didn't just vibrate; it sang with the frequency of a thousand "You Tried" stickers. 

[Participation Trophy (Cursed/Soul-bound)]
[Effect: Aura of the Beacon (+500% Aggro)]
[Effect: Magnetic Failure (Projectile Attraction)]

"I hate this thing," Artie wheezed, his boots skidding on the gravel as the treeline finally broke. "I hate the System. I hate math."

"Math loves you, Artie! It just has a very aggressive way of showing it!" Fizz pointed ahead. "Look! The Oakhaven Safe Zone! If we cross the threshold, the aggro-leash should snap!"

The gates of Oakhaven weren't just wood and iron. They were a sprawling monument to the System’s obsession with order. Massive white stone pillars rose from the earth, inscribed with glowing blue runes that pulsed in time with the world’s heartbeat. Above the archway, a massive floating UI display read: [WELCOME TO OAKHAVEN - POPULATION: 1,242 (98.4% STABLE)].

Artie didn't care about the stability. He cared about the invisible line in the dirt. He threw himself forward, the wolf lunging behind him, its jaws snapping inches from his Linen Tunic. If those teeth touched him, he was gone. One hit point. One. He was a soap bubble in a world made of needles.

He crossed the line.

*BZZZT.*

The wolf hit an invisible wall of shimmering blue force and bounced backward, its snarl turning into a series of glitched whimpers. The slimes and the badger followed suit, piling up against the barrier like a crowd at a sold-out concert.

[Entering: Oakhaven (Safe Zone)]
[Aggro Cleared. Welcome, Traveler.]

Artie collapsed onto the cobbles, the Participation Trophy clattering against the stones. It didn't fall out of his hand, of course. It was soul-bound. It just sat there, glowing with a smug, golden light, attracting the curious stares of a few nearby NPCs.

"We... we made it," Artie gasped, watching his stamina bar begin its agonizingly slow crawl back toward double digits.

"Don't get too comfortable," Fizz said, landing on his shoulder. "We still have to pass the Gate Scanner. And usually, the System likes its travelers to have, you know, more than one hit point and a luck stat that doesn't look like a typo."

Artie looked up. Suspended from the center of the gate’s arch was a massive, crystalline eye. It wasn't a biological eye; it was a multifaceted diamond that rotated with a series of mechanical clicks. As he stood up, the eye swiveled toward him. A beam of pale green light shot out, sweeping from his boots to his head.

[Initiating Standard Entry Scan...]
[Analyzing Player Data: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon...]
[Level: 2]
[Class: N/A (Unassigned)]

The green light hit the Participation Trophy. The beam immediately flickered, turning a sickly shade of yellow. 

"Oh, here we go," Fizz muttered, her Data Slate beginning to spark.

[Warning: High-Level Aggro-Beacon Detected.]
[Analyzing Item: Participation Trophy...]
[Result: Cursed. Soul-bound. Tier 3 System Error Source.]

The scanner’s mechanical clicking accelerated. The green light turned a violent, pulsing red. The floating UI display above the gate began to scroll through text at a speed that made Artie's head spin.

[Error: Statistical Inconsistency Detected.]
[Checking HP...]
[HP: 1/1]
[Result: Within Bounds (Technically).]

[Checking Luck...]
[Luck: 104]
[Result: Out of Range for Level 2. Recalculating...]

[Checking Critical Hit Rate...]
[Crit Rate: 100%]
[Result: FATAL ERROR.]

"Fizz, what’s it doing?" Artie asked, backing away as the crystalline eye began to smoke.

"It's trying to find a category for you!" she shouted over the rising whine of the scanner. "The System hates anomalies, Artie! It wants everyone in a neat little box! A 'Warrior' box or a 'Mage' box! You’re a 'One-Hit-Point-Walking-Nuclear-Option' box!"

Two guards in polished silver plate armor stepped forward, their hands on the pommels of their swords. Above their heads, their tags read [Oakhaven Gate Guard - Lvl 25]. They looked bored, but as the scanner began to wail, that boredom shifted into visible confusion.

"Identify yourself, traveler!" the lead guard shouted. "And put that... whatever that golden thing is... away!"

"I can't!" Artie yelled back, holding up his left hand. "It's stuck! It's a reward! Sort of!"

The scanner reached a crescendo. A bolt of red energy shot from the eye, striking the ground in front of Artie and forming a massive, shimmering holographic window that everyone in the vicinity could see.

[CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE: DATA OVERFLOW]
[Subject: CHAR_ARTIE]
[Logic Loop: 100% Crit + 1 HP = Does Not Compute.]
[Applying Emergency Classification...]

The red light suddenly vanished, replaced by a dull, persistent purple glow that settled over Artie like a heavy blanket. He felt a weight on his chest, not physical, but digital. A new icon appeared next to his name in his peripheral vision.

[New Title Assigned: Statistical Anomaly]
[Description: You are a glitch in the grand design. A rounding error with a pulse. The System cannot account for your existence, so it has simply decided to label you 'Problematic.']

[Entry Permitted (Under Protest).]

The guards looked at the purple tag hovering over Artie's head. They looked at each other. The lead guard sighed and stepped aside.

"An Anomaly, huh?" he muttered, shaking his head. "Great. Another one of those. Just don't go critting the fountain, kid. The Mayor hates cleaning up the logic-leaks."

The gates groaned open, revealing the bustling streets of Oakhaven. 

"See?" Fizz said, her wings fluttering with relief. "Entry granted. And you only broke one automated security system to do it. That’s a new personal record."

Artie looked at the purple 'Statistical Anomaly' tag reflecting in a nearby puddle. It pulsed with a steady, rhythmic light, marking him as something different, something broken.

"I have a feeling," Artie said, stepping into the city, "that 'under protest' is going to be the theme of my life here."
