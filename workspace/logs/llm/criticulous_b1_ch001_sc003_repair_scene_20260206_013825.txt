PROSE:

The transition from the flickering blue void of the System’s waiting room to the physical world felt less like a magical teleportation and more like being shoved out of a moving car into a pile of damp laundry. 

Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon hit the grass with the grace of a dropped sack of flour. He didn't even fall from a height; he simply materialized six inches above the ground and succumbed to gravity. Yet, the moment his chest brushed the clover, a terrifying red flash strobed across his vision, accompanied by a sound like a klaxon muffled by a heavy blanket.

[Warning: Kinetic Impact Detected!]
[Damage Negated: Tutorial Grace Period (0.9s remaining)]
[Current HP: 1/1]
[Note: You are currently one aggressive sneeze away from a permanent 'Game Over'. Please exercise extreme caution, or don't. The System enjoys the paperwork either way.]

Artie lay perfectly still, his cheek pressed against a blade of grass that looked suspiciously sharp. His heart hammered against his ribs—a frantic, rhythmic reminder that his entire existence now hung by a thread of code thinner than a spider's silk. "I’m alive," he whispered, the words catching in a throat that felt like it was lined with sandpaper. "Or at least, I’m not dead again. Yet."

"Oh, good! You didn't shatter on impact," a cheery, high-pitched voice chirped from somewhere above his left ear. 

Artie rolled onto his back with the agonizing slowness of a man trying not to trigger a pressure-sensitive landmine. Fizz was hovering there, her translucent wings buzzing with a sound like a malfunctioning drone. She looked down at him, her tiny face twisted into an expression of morbid curiosity, her hands tucked into the small pouch at her waist.

"Welcome to the Tutorial Zone, Artie! It’s green, it’s lush, and it’s statistically likely to be the last thing you ever see," she said, doing a little loop-de-loop that sent a spray of Sparkle Dust over his nose. "How’s the 1 HP treating you? Feeling... fragile? Brittle? Perhaps a bit like a Faberge egg in a rock tumbler?"

"I feel like a glass statue in a seismic testing facility," Artie grunted. He pushed himself up, his movements jerky and precise. Every joint felt like it was made of porcelain. He checked his right hand, his fingers tightening around the grip of the Rusty Shortsword. The prop—the same one that had acted as a lightning rod for the Snack-O-Matic 3000 back in the office—was still there, its metal cold and pitted. It looked even more pathetic in the sunlight of this new world, the rust flakes glinting like sad, orange glitter.

He patted his pockets with his left hand, careful not to jostle his own frame. The dead weight of his smartphone and his wallet were still there. Small, useless comforts from a life ended by a bag of 'Nacho Average Jalapeño' chips.

"Okay," Artie said, standing fully upright and swaying slightly as the wind caught his jacket. "I’m in the game. I’ve got the sword. I’ve got the guide. Now, where’s the easy stuff? Give me a quest to pick flowers or talk to a confused villager. Something that doesn't involve moving parts or, you know, physics."

"About that," Fizz said, pointing a tiny, shimmering finger toward a patch of nearby bushes. "The System doesn't really do 'peaceful' for anomalies. It prefers 'stress-testing'. And you, Artie, are the ultimate stress test."

The bushes parted with a soft rustle. Out wobbled a creature that, in any other context, would have been adorable. It was a translucent, neon-green blob about the size of a beach ball. It had two black dots for eyes and a permanent, mindless smile etched into its gelatinous face.

[Lesser Forest Slime - Lvl 1]
[HP: 10/10]

"It’s a slime," Artie said, his voice flat. He leveled the rusty prop sword at the creature, his right arm trembling slightly. "It’s the literal bottom of the food chain. I could probably kill it by looking at it funny."

"True," Fizz agreed, crossing her arms as she floated at eye level. "But remember that whole 'stat allocation' fiasco back in the void? You know, where you let a stray electrical charge from your vending machine death dump all your points into Critical Probability instead of Vitality?"

Artie winced. The memory of the UI glitching, the bars sliding all the way to the right while he screamed in the blue darkness, was still fresh. "I remember. I wanted to be a tank. I wanted to be unkillable."

"Right. Well, the System has a sense of irony. That Slime has an attack power of 2. You have a maximum health of 1. Do the math, Artie. In this world, that jiggling pile of lime gelatin is essentially a tactical nuke. If it so much as brushes against your shoelaces, you’re going back to the vending machine in the sky."

The slime let out a wet, squelching sound and began to hop toward him. It wasn't fast—it moved with the rhythmic, leisurely pace of a toddler—but every time it hit the ground, the vibration felt like a tremor to Artie’s heightened, terrified senses.

"Stay back," Artie warned, his voice rising an octave. "I mean it. I’ve got a 100% Crit rate. I’ll vaporize you into a puddle of floor cleaner."

The slime didn't care. It didn't have ears, a brain, or a sense of self-preservation. It just had a hunger for anything that wasn't green. It hopped again, closing the distance to three meters.

Artie took a step back, his boots crunching on the dry grass. His heel caught on a protruding root, and he nearly tumbled. The red warning flash returned instantly, pulsing at the corner of his eye as his balance wavered.

[Caution: Environmental Hazard! Stability at 42%. Fall damage is lethal for entities with < 2 HP.]

"Are you kidding me?" Artie hissed, flailing his left arm to steady himself while keeping the sword pointed forward. "I can die from tripping? Who designed this? I want to speak to a developer! I want to file a bug report!"

"The developers are busy counting the souls of people who died to vending machines and faulty toasters," Fizz said, floating just out of reach. "Focus, Artie! If that thing touches your boots, you’re done. It’s a 'Contact Damage' type. Very basic. Very lethal for a man with the constitution of wet tissue paper."

The slime lunged. It wasn't a fast jump, but it was aimed directly at Artie’s shins. 

Artie scrambled backward, his breath coming in ragged gasps. He wasn't just afraid; he was insulted. He was a grown man being hunted by a dessert. He swung the rusty sword in a wide, desperate arc, but the slime was already mid-recoil, its gelatinous body absorbing the vibration of the air. The blade whistled through empty space, the weight of the swing nearly pulling Artie off his feet.

"Swing harder!" Fizz encouraged, though she sounded like she was enjoying the show. "Or, you know, run. Running is good. I highly recommend running as a primary combat strategy for the rest of your very short life."

Artie didn't need to be told twice. He turned and bolted toward a cluster of ancient-looking oaks. Every footfall felt like a gamble. Every time his boots hit the uneven soil, he expected the System to inform him that he’d shattered his ankles and died of shock. 

[Stamina: 14/20]
[Warning: Low Stamina. Movement speed will be penalized shortly.]

"I have twenty stamina?" Artie yelled over his shoulder, his lungs already burning. "I’ve seen smokers with better lung capacity than this avatar!"

"You put zero points into Endurance, Artie! You’re lucky you can walk and talk at the same time without fainting!"

He reached the first tree, a massive thing with bark as thick as armor plating. He spun around, his back hitting the rough wood. He braced himself, absorbing the impact with his knees to avoid another 'Critical Impact' warning. 

The slime was still coming. It had rounded the bushes and was now ten feet away, its mindless smile seemingly wider now, as if it knew it had its prey cornered. It squelched, a sound of pure, unadulterated hunger.

Artie gripped the hilt of his sword with both hands now, his knuckles white. He was backed against the tree, the rough bark scraping against his shirt. To his left, a steep drop-off into a ravine. To his right, thick thorny brambles that would surely trigger a 'Bleed' effect—which, for him, was just another word for 'Deletion'.

"Okay, okay," Artie muttered, his eyes locked on the bouncing green menace. "One hit. That’s all I need. 100% Crit. If I land one blow, it’s over. I just have to not die first."

"And if it lands one hop?" Fizz asked, hovering right in his line of sight, her expression unhelpfully cheerful.

"Then I hope the next guy who tries to get those Jalapeño chips has better luck than I did."

The slime paused, its base expanding as it prepared for a larger leap. Artie held his breath, the rusty sword trembling in his hands. He was a glass cannon in a world made of hammers, and the first hammer was about to drop.
