PROSE:
The Snack-O-Matic 9000 was a cruel, unyielding mistress, and she was currently holding Arthur Penhaligon’s lunch hostage.

Artie stood in the office breakroom, the fluorescent lights overhead flickering with a rhythmic, soul-sucking hum that matched the dull throb in his temples. His Polyester Suit—a bargain-bin special that possessed the breathability of a plastic trash bag—was already sticking to his lower back. It was 2:15 PM on a Tuesday. He had three spreadsheets due by five, a supervisor who used "synergy" as a threat, and a stomach that was currently performing a convincing impression of a dying whale.

He looked down at his right hand. The One Dollar Coin sat there, a dull gold disc that represented the absolute limit of his liquid assets until Friday’s direct deposit hit. This wasn't just a dollar; it was a bridge to the only thing that could get him through the afternoon: a bag of Zesty Ranch Zings.

"Don't do it, Artie," he whispered to himself. "She smells weakness."

He ignored his own advice. He leaned forward, the Plastic ID Badge tucked safely in his left pocket pressing against his thigh as he reached for the coin slot. He slid the dollar in.

The machine swallowed it with a mechanical gulp. Artie pressed the buttons: B-4. The metal spiral began to rotate. It was a slow, agonizing crawl, the bag of Zings inching forward like a condemned man walking toward the gallows. The spiral completed its turn. The bag tipped. It leaned.

And then, it stopped.

The bag was dangling by a single, microscopic corner of crimped plastic, caught on the very tip of the metal coil. It swayed gently in the stagnant air of the breakroom, mocking him.

"You have got to be kidding me," Artie muttered, pressing his forehead against the cool glass. 

He checked his internal state of mind. If he had a UI, his 'Patience' bar would be flashing red and emitting a high-pitched whine. He looked around. The breakroom was empty, save for a half-empty pot of coffee that looked like it had been brewed during the Nixon administration. No witnesses.

Artie gripped the sides of the Snack-O-Matic. "Give. Me. My. Zings."

He gave the machine a firm shake. The glass rattled. The bag of chips didn't budge. It just swung there, a neon-orange middle finger to his existence. 

His life felt like a series of poorly rolled checks. His Spreadsheet Management skill was at a respectable Rank 4, sure, but it didn't help when the physical world decided to glitch out on him. He was just a man with a Rank 2 Passive-Aggressive Emailing skill and a Title that probably read [Unsuspecting Victim of Late-Stage Capitalism].

He reached into the dispenser flap at the bottom, his arm disappearing into the dark, crumb-filled maw of the machine. He reached up, trying to find the bottom of the B-4 tray. His fingers brushed against cold metal and something that felt suspiciously like a petrified gummy bear.

"Just... one... inch..."

That’s when he heard it. A low, predatory growl coming from the guts of the machine. Not the sound of a cooling fan, but the sound of an electrical transformer reaching its breaking point. 

A blue spark jumped from the coin return to his thumb.

[System Notification]
[Critical Hit! -10 HP]

The world didn't just go dark; it inverted. The beige walls of the breakroom shattered into a million jagged pixels. His Polyester Suit felt like it was melting into his skin, and for a brief, agonizing second, Artie could see the skeletal structure of his own hand illuminated by a surge of pure, unadulterated voltage.

He didn't even have time to scream. His heart, which had been at a steady 75 BPM, decided to skip the rest of the song and go straight to the silence at the end of the track.

[HP: 0/10]
[Status: Deceased]

Then came the void.

It wasn't black, exactly. It was the color of a monitor that was turned on but displaying nothing—a deep, humming grey that stretched out into infinity. Artie didn't have a body anymore, or if he did, it was currently being handled by the local paramedics back in the breakroom. He was just a point of consciousness floating in the digital soup.

"Great," he thought. "I died for Zesty Ranch Zings. My obituary is going to be a punchline."

Suddenly, a box of light snapped into existence in front of his non-existent eyes. It wasn't a heavenly gate or a tunnel of light. It was a window. A UI window.

[System Notification]
[User 'Arthur Penhaligon' has successfully disconnected from Server: EARTH_01.]
[Reason: Fatal Hardware Error (Vending Machine Malfunction).]

"Fatal hardware error?" Artie tried to shout, but the words only appeared as a thought-echo in the grey. "It was a bag of chips! I want a refund!"

[Scanning soul for compatible attributes...]
[Luck Stat: 1]
[Warning: Statistical Anomaly Detected.]
[Applying System Stress Test...]
[Luck stat has triggered an Integer Underflow!]

The grey void began to vibrate. 

[Recalculating...]
[Due to your unique circumstances, you have been selected for the 'Beta-Glitch' Compensation Package.]

[Welcome to the System. Please prepare for Character Creation.]

Artie stared at the floating text. This was it. The 'Ding' he’d been waiting for his entire life, even if he’d had to die to hear it. Somewhere in the back of his mind, the ghost of his Passive-Aggressive Emailing skill whispered that he should probably ask to speak to a manager about the electrocution, but the rest of him was too busy watching the numbers start to roll.
