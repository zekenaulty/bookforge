PROSE:

The transition from the Character Creation Suite to the Whispering Woods didn't feel like a majestic step into a new world; it felt like being shoved through a narrow pipe while wearing a suit made of sandpaper. One moment I was staring at a snarky UI and a floating guide who looked like she’d rather be anywhere else, and the next, the smell of damp pine and rot hit me like a physical blow.

I stumbled, my feet catching on a stray root. My heart did a frantic tap-dance against my ribs.

[System Notification: Warning!]
[Status: Fragile is active.]
[Caution: Physical impact detected. HP: 1/1. Any further trauma will result in immediate Deletion.]

"Easy there, Glass Joe," Fizz said, her voice floating down from somewhere above my left shoulder. She was lazily flipping through the *Standard Guide's Manual*, her translucent wings buzzing with a sound that reminded me of a failing fluorescent light. "The ground is technically an environmental hazard for you now. Try to stay vertical."

I froze, one hand gripping the rough bark of a nearby sapling to steady myself. My palm stung. Even that tiny friction felt dangerous, like the bark was trying to sand down my existence. I looked down at my hands—pale, trembling, and definitely not equipped for a world that wanted to kill me. 

"You’re kidding," I whispered, my voice cracking. "One HP? I’ve had papercuts more substantial than my entire life bar."

"Hey, you're the one who dumped everything into Crits," Fizz replied, not looking up from her book. "The System just balanced the scales. You’re the ultimate glass cannon, Artie. Minus the cannon part, for now. Right now, you’re just the glass."

I reached into my pocket, my fingers brushing against my Leather Wallet and the cold, jagged edges of my Keyring. They felt absurdly heavy. My keys—the ones to an apartment I’d never see again and a car that was probably being towed from the office parking lot—were currently the most dangerous things I owned. If I fell on them, I was dead.

A low, wet sound echoed through the clearing. It wasn't a growl, exactly. It was more like someone dropping a giant bowl of gelatin onto a marble floor. 

*Schlorp.*

I turned my head slowly. Twenty feet away, the ferns parted. Emerging from the undergrowth was a creature that, in any other RPG, would have been the punchline of a tutorial joke. It was a translucent green blob, about the size of a beach ball, vibrating with a rhythmic intensity that made the grass beneath it quiver.

[Lesser Forest Slime - Lvl 1]
[HP: 10/10]

A tiny, red health bar hovered over its jiggly head. It looked harmless. It looked like something you’d find in a high-end candy store. But as it turned toward me, its entire body rippled, and I saw the way the acidic slime dissolved the fallen leaves in its path.

"Fizz," I said, my voice rising an octave. "Tell me that thing is a passive mob."

"Let's see," Fizz hummed, finally closing her manual with a snap. She squinted at the slime. "Lesser Forest Slime. Diet: organic matter, small rodents, and... oh, look at that. 'Unwary Level 1 Travelers.' It’s an aggressive-type. It probably thinks you’re a particularly crunchy snack."

The slime lunged. It didn't move fast, but it moved with a terrifying, mindless persistence. It compressed its body and then sprang forward, covering three feet in a single, wet hop.

"Move!" Fizz chirped.

I didn't need the prompt. I scrambled backward, my boots slipping on the mulch. Every step was a gamble. If I tripped, I died. If I hit a branch, I died. The world had become a minefield of mundane objects. I could feel the 'Fragile' status humming in my bones, a constant, low-frequency reminder that I was essentially made of fine china.

[System Notification]
[Title Active: Crit or Quit]
[Effect: 100% Critical Hit Rate confirmed. Penalty: HP capped at 1/1.]

"I can't fight that thing!" I yelled, backing away as the slime hopped again. *Schlorp.* It was closer now. I could see the bits of undigested twigs floating inside its translucent gut. "I don't even have a sword! I have a rewards card for a sandwich shop and a set of house keys!"

"Then use your keys!" Fizz suggested, hovering just out of reach. "You have a hundred percent crit rate, Artie. You could probably kill a god with a toothpick if you timed it right. Of course, the god would only have to sneeze on you to win, but that’s the 'Quit' part of the title."

The slime hopped again, and this time, it was close enough that I could smell it—a cloying, sweet scent like rotting peaches. It wasn't just a blob; it was a predator. Its surface tension rippled as it prepared for a larger leap.

I backed up further, my heart hammering against my chest so hard I was afraid it would count as internal damage. My heel hit something solid. I glanced back.

A massive, ancient oak tree blocked my path. Its roots were gnarled and thick, twisting out of the earth like petrified snakes. I was cornered. 

The slime sensed it. It stopped five feet away, its body pulsing, glowing with a faint, sickly green light as it drew in air—or whatever it used for breath—to launch itself at my face.

"Okay, Penhaligon," I muttered to myself, my breath coming in shallow, ragged gasps. "Think. You're a spreadsheet guy. You're a data analyst. This is just a hostile merger. With a giant grape."

I reached into my right pocket and gripped my Keyring. I pulled it out, the metal jingling with a sound that felt like a funeral bell. I didn't have a shield. I didn't have armor. I had a 100% chance to do something spectacular, and a 100% chance to die if I messed it up.

I dropped into a low, desperate crouch, my back pressed against the rough bark of the tree. I held the keys out in front of me like a dinky, silver dagger, my knuckles white. 

"Come on, then," I snarled at the vibrating puddle of goo. "Let's see if the math holds up."

The slime compressed itself into a flat pancake, then launched.
