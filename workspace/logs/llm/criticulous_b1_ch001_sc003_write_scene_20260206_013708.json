  "text": "COMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: SC_001_003\nAllowed events: Spawning into tutorial zone, encountering Level 1 Slime, realizing 1 HP fragility, being backed against a tree.\nForbidden milestones: tutorial_slime_kill (NOT_YET), level_up (NOT_YET), participation_trophy_acquisition (NOT_YET).\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: CHAR_ARTIE -> Rusty Shortsword (Prop) (carried, hand_right); Smartphone (dead) (stowed, pockets); Wallet (stowed, pockets).\n\nPROSE:\n\nThe transition from the flickering blue void of the System\u2019s waiting room to the physical world felt less like a magical teleportation and more like being shoved out of a moving car into a pile of damp laundry. \n\nArthur 'Artie' Penhaligon hit the grass face-first. The impact wasn't hard, but a terrifying red flash strobed across his vision, accompanied by a sound like a klaxon muffled by a pillow.\n\n[Warning! Critical Impact Detected!]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Note: You are currently one aggressive sneeze away from a permanent 'Game Over'. Please exercise extreme caution, or don't. The System enjoys the paperwork either way.]\n\nArtie lay perfectly still, his cheek pressed against a blade of grass that looked suspiciously sharp. \"I\u2019m alive,\" he whispered. \"Or at least, I\u2019m not dead again. Yet.\"\n\n\"Oh, good! You didn't shatter on impact,\" a cheery, high-pitched voice chirped from somewhere above his left ear. \n\nArtie rolled onto his back with the agonizing slowness of a man trying not to trigger a landmine. Fizz was hovering there, her translucent wings buzzing with a sound like a malfunctioning drone. She looked down at him, her tiny face twisted into an expression of morbid curiosity.\n\n\"Welcome to the Tutorial Zone, Artie! It\u2019s green, it\u2019s lush, and it\u2019s statistically likely to be the last thing you ever see,\" she said, doing a little loop-de-loop. \"How\u2019s the 1 HP treating you? Feeling... fragile? Brittle? Perhaps a bit like a Faberge egg in a rock tumbler?\"\n\n\"I feel like a glass statue in a seismic testing facility,\" Artie grunted. He pushed himself up, his movements jerky and precise. He checked his right hand. The Rusty Shortsword\u2014the same prop that had acted as a lightning rod for the Snack-O-Matic 3000 back in the office\u2014was still gripped firmly in his fist. It looked even more pathetic in the sunlight of this new world, the rust flakes glinting like sad, orange glitter.\n\nHe patted his pockets. The dead weight of his smartphone and his wallet were still there. Small comforts from a life ended by a bag of 'Nacho Average Jalape\u00f1o' chips.\n\n\"Okay,\" Artie said, standing fully upright and swaying slightly. \"I\u2019m in the game. I\u2019ve got the sword. I\u2019ve got the guide. Now, where\u2019s the easy stuff? Give me a quest to pick flowers or talk to a confused villager. Something that doesn't involve moving parts.\"\n\n\"About that,\" Fizz said, pointing a tiny, shimmering finger toward a patch of nearby bushes. \"The System doesn't really do 'peaceful' for anomalies. It prefers 'stress-testing'.\"\n\nThe bushes parted. Out wobbled a creature that, in any other context, would have been adorable. It was a translucent, neon-green blob about the size of a beach ball. It had two black dots for eyes and a permanent, mindless smile.\n\n[Lesser Forest Slime - Lvl 1]\n[HP: 10/10]\n\n\"It\u2019s a slime,\" Artie said, his voice flat. \"It\u2019s the literal bottom of the food chain. I could probably kill it by looking at it funny.\"\n\n\"True,\" Fizz agreed, crossing her arms. \"But remember that whole 'stat allocation' fiasco? You know, where you let a stray electrical charge dump all your points into Critical Probability instead of Vitality?\"\n\nArtie winced. The memory of the UI glitching, the bars sliding all the way to the right while he screamed in the void, was still fresh. \"I remember.\"\n\n\"Right. Well, that Slime has an attack power of 2. You have a maximum health of 1. Do the math, Artie. In this world, that jiggling pile of lime gelatin is essentially a tactical nuke.\"\n\nThe slime let out a wet, squelching sound and began to hop toward him. It wasn't fast\u2014it moved with the rhythmic, leisurely pace of a toddler\u2014but every time it hit the ground, Artie\u2019s heart skipped a beat.\n\n\"Stay back,\" Artie warned, leveling the rusty prop sword at the creature. \"I mean it. I\u2019ve got a 100% Crit rate. I\u2019ll vaporize you.\"\n\nThe slime didn't care. It didn't have ears, a brain, or a sense of self-preservation. It just had a hunger for anything that wasn't green. It hopped again, closing the distance to three meters.\n\nArtie took a step back. His heel caught on a protruding root, and he nearly tumbled. The red warning flash returned, pulsing at the corner of his eye as his balance wavered.\n\n[Caution: Environmental Hazard! Stability at 42%. Fall damage is lethal.]\n\n\"Are you kidding me?\" Artie hissed, flailing his left arm to steady himself. \"I can die from tripping? Who designed this? I want to speak to a developer!\"\n\n\"The developers are busy counting the souls of people who died to vending machines,\" Fizz said, floating just out of reach. \"Focus, Artie! If that thing touches your boots, you\u2019re done. It\u2019s a 'Contact Damage' type. Very basic. Very lethal for a man with the constitution of wet tissue paper.\"\n\nThe slime lunged. It wasn't a fast jump, but it was aimed directly at Artie\u2019s shins. \n\nArtie scrambled backward, his breath coming in ragged gasps. He wasn't just afraid; he was insulted. He was a grown man being hunted by a dessert. He swung the rusty sword in a wide, desperate arc, but the slime was already mid-recoil, its gelatinous body absorbing the vibration of the air.\n\n\"Swing harder!\" Fizz encouraged. \"Or, you know, run. Running is good. I highly recommend running.\"\n\nArtie didn't need to be told twice. He turned and bolted toward a cluster of ancient-looking oaks. Every footfall felt like a gamble. Every time his boots hit the uneven soil, he expected the System to inform him that he\u2019d shattered his ankles and died of shock. \n\n[Stamina: 14/20]\n[Warning: Low Stamina. Movement speed will be penalized shortly.]\n\n\"I have twenty stamina?\" Artie yelled over his shoulder. \"I\u2019ve seen smokers with better lung capacity!\"\n\n\"You put zero points into Endurance, Artie! You\u2019re lucky you can walk and talk at the same time!\"\n\nHe reached the first tree, a massive thing with bark as thick as armor plating. He spun around, his back hitting the rough wood. The impact was firm, but he\u2019d braced himself enough to avoid the 'Critical Impact' warning this time. \n\nThe slime was still coming. It had rounded the bushes and was now ten feet away, its mindless smile seemingly wider now, as if it knew it had its prey cornered. It squelched, a sound of pure, unadulterated hunger.\n\nArtie gripped the hilt of his sword with both hands, his knuckles white. He was backed against the tree, the rough bark scraping against his shirt. To his left, a steep drop-off into a ravine. To his right, thick thorny brambles that would surely trigger a 'Bleed' effect\u2014which, for him, was just another word for 'Death'.\n\n\"Okay, okay,\" Artie muttered, his eyes locked on the bouncing green menace. \"One hit. That\u2019s all I need. 100% Crit. If I land one blow, it\u2019s over.\"\n\n\"And if it lands one hop?\" Fizz asked, hovering right in his line of sight.\n\n\"Then I hope the next guy who tries to get those Jalape\u00f1o chips has better luck than I did.\"\n\nThe slime paused, its base expanding as it prepared for a larger leap. Artie held his breath, the rusty sword trembling in his hands. He was a glass cannon in a world made of hammers, and the first hammer was about to drop.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present_ids\": [\"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"CHAR_FIZZ\"],\n    \"location\": \"Tutorial Zone\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie spawned into the Tutorial Zone and nearly died from the impact of hitting the ground.\",\n      \"Artie encountered a Level 1 Lesser Forest Slime.\",\n      \"Artie realized that 1 HP makes even the weakest enemies and environmental hazards lethal.\",\n      \"Artie is currently backed against a tree by the slime.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\", \"THREAD_SYSTEM_GLITCH\"]\n  },\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 3,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\"item\": \"Rusty Shortsword (Prop)\", \"container\": \"hand_right\", \"status\": \"carried\"},\n        {\"item\": \"Smartphone (dead)\", \"container\": \"pockets\", \"status\": \"stowed\"},\n        {\"item\": \"Wallet\", \"container\": \"pockets\", \"status\": \"stowed\"}\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\"container\": \"hand_right\", \"location\": \"arm_right\", \"contents\": [\"Rusty Shortsword (Prop)\"]},\n        {\"container\": \"pockets\", \"location\": \"legs\", \"contents\": [\"Smartphone (dead)\", \"Wallet\"]}\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie is experiencing acute mechanical dread regarding his 1 HP status.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie spawned into the Tutorial Zone, discovering that his 1 HP build makes even landing on grass a near-death experience.\",\n      \"He was immediately confronted by a Level 1 Slime and forced to flee as contact would result in instant death.\",\n      \"The scene ended with Artie backed against a tree, preparing for a desperate first strike against the creature.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Artie arrived in the Tutorial Zone with 1/1 HP.\",\n      \"Fizz explained the lethality of 'Contact Damage' for a 1 HP build.\",\n      \"Artie attempted to flee from a Level 1 Lesser Forest Slime.\",\n      \"Artie realized environmental hazards like falling or tripping are now lethal.\",\n      \"Artie was cornered against a tree by the slime.\",\n      \"milestone: tutorial_arrival = DONE\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"milestone: artie_death = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: stat_allocation = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: tutorial_arrival = DONE\",\n      \"status: CHAR_ARTIE -> 1 HP (hard constraint)\",\n      \"status: CHAR_ARTIE -> 100% Critical Hit Rate (hard constraint)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Rusty Shortsword (Prop) (carried, hand_right)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Smartphone (dead) (stowed, pockets)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Wallet (stowed, pockets)\",\n      \"milestone: tutorial_slime_kill = NOT_YET\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Artie arrived in the Tutorial Zone and discovered that his 'Glass Cannon' build turns minor inconveniences into life-threatening hazards.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the RNG-Hellscape\",\"goal\":\"Introduce Artie and his

If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n- Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\n- Inventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- For held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\n- If a required event is not in the Scene Card, do not perform it.\n- summary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\n- STATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\n- If state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\n- Return prose plus a state_patch JSON block.\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Use cursor_advance only if you need to override the default cursor.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n  - Each entry must include character_id, chapter, scene, inventory (full current list), containers (full current list), invariants_add (array), persona_updates (array).\n  - If you have a single persona update, still wrap it in an array of strings.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger and invariants using standard phrasing, e.g.:\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> shard (carried, container=satchel)\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> longsword (carried, container=hand_right)\n  - container: satchel (owner=CHAR_example, contents=[shard, maps])\n  - milestone: shard_bind = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - milestone: maps_acquired = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - injury: right forearm scar / left arm filament\n  - ownership: shard (carried) / shard (bound but physical)\n\nScene card:\n{\n  \"cast_present\": [\n    \"Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon\",\n    \"Fizz\"\n  ],\n  \"cast_present_ids\": [\n    \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n    \"CHAR_FIZZ\"\n  ],\n  \"chapter\": 1,\n  \"conflict\": \"Artie must avoid a seemingly harmless Level 1 Slime because any contact results in instant death.\",\n  \"constraints\": [\n    \"target_words: 2000\",\n    \"milestone: tutorial_arrival = DONE\",\n    \"status: CHAR_ARTIE -> 1 HP (hard constraint)\",\n    \"status: CHAR_ARTIE -> 100% Critical Hit Rate (hard constraint)\",\n    \"no-recaps\"\n  ],\n  \"end_condition\": \"Artie is backed against a tree by the slime, realizing his survival depends on never being touched.\",\n  \"goal\": \"Establish the terrifying reality of the 1 HP Glass Cannon build.\",\n  \"introduces\": [],\n  \"introduces_ids\": [],\n  \"required_callbacks\": [\n    \"stat_allocation\",\n    \"artie_death\"\n  ],\n  \"scene\": 3,\n  \"scene_id\": \"SC_001_003\",\n  \"scene_target\": \"Artie spawns into the tutorial zone and faces his first immediate threat.\",\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.1\",\n  \"thread_ids\": []\n}\n\nContinuity pack:\n{\n  \"cast_present\": [\n    \"Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon\",\n    \"Fizz\"\n  ],\n  \"constraints\": [\n    \"milestone: artie_death = DONE\",\n    \"milestone: stat_allocation = DONE\",\n    \"milestone: tutorial_arrival = NOT_YET\",\n    \"status: CHAR_ARTIE -> 1 HP (hard constraint)\",\n    \"status: CHAR_ARTIE -> 100% Critical Hit Rate (hard constraint)\",\n    \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Rusty Shortsword (Prop) (carried, hand_right)\",\n    \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Smartphone (dead) (stowed, pockets)\",\n    \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Wallet (stowed, pockets)\"\n  ],\n  \"location\": \"Tutorial Zone\",\n  \"next_action\": \"Artie spawns into the tutorial zone and faces his first immediate threat, a Level 1 Slime.\",\n  \"open_threads\": [\n    \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\",\n    \"THREAD_SYSTEM_GLITCH\"\n  ],\n  \"scene_end_anchor\": \"The System finalized Artie's build as a 'Glass Cannon' with 100% Critical Hit Rate and 1 HP.

it vibrated with the rhythmic intensity of a subwoofer in a teenager\u2019s trunk. I checked the floating red bar hovering above its translucent, jiggly head. \n\n[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 3] [HP: 45/45]\n\nForty-five health. At my current Strength of 12, with a base weapon damage of 4-6, I was looking at a nine-hit kill minimum, assuming the RNG gods didn't decide to spit on my shoes today. \n\n\"You know,\" I said, adjusting my grip on the rusted shortsword. \"In most worlds, puddles are for stepping in, not for getting dissolved by.\"\n\nThe slime responded by launching a glob of corrosive mucus. I rolled left, the grass staining my knees.\n\n[Stamina: 88/100]\n\n\"Missed me. Barely. That\u2019s a three-second cooldown on your spit, isn't it?\"\n\nI didn't wait for the confirmation. I lunged. The blade sank into the gelatinous mass with a sound like a heavy boot pulling out of thick mud.\n\n[Critical Hit! -14 HP]\n\n\"There we go. Who needs luck when you have math?\"\n\nThe slime shuddered, its HP bar dipping into the yellow. \n\n[HP: 31/45]\n\n\"One more of those and we can talk about your retirement plan,\" I muttered. My lungs burned slightly, a reminder that my Agility was still garbage. \n\n[Passive Skill Gained: Basic Analysis (Rank F)]\n[Description: You can see basic stats and cooldowns of enemies within 5 meters. You\u2019ve stopped guessing and started counting. Good for you.]\n\n\"Finally,\" I breathed, dodging another glob. \"The ding is coming. I can practically taste the experience points. They taste like copper and bad decisions.\" \n\nI swung again, the numbers popping in the air like neon confetti. This wasn't just a fight; it was a grind. And in this world, the grind was the only thing that kept you from becoming part of the scenery.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"characters\": {\n    \"count\": 5,\n    \"status\": \"READY\",\n    \"updated_at\": \"2026-02-06T01:21:05Z\"\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 3\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"outline\": {\n    \"path\": \"outline/outline.json\"\n  },\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_001/scene_003.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"DRAFTING\",\n  \"summary\": {\n    \"chapter_so_far\": [\n      \"Artie died in a mundane office accident and has been drafted into a System-driven world.\",\n      \"Artie met Fizz and accidentally created a broken 'Glass Cannon' build with 1 HP and 100% Crit rate.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_facts_ring\": [\n      \"Artie is introduced as a cynical office drone carrying a LARP prop (Rusty Shortsword).\",\n      \"A bag of 'Nacho Average Jalape\\u00f1o' chips gets stuck in the Snack-O-Matic 3000.\",\n      \"Artie attempts to shake the machine and reach into the bin for the chips.\",\n      \"The Rusty Shortsword conducts a fatal electrical surge from a frayed wire into Artie.\",\n      \"Artie dies and his consciousness enters the System Void.\",\n      \"The System mocks Artie's 'Stupidity-Induced Electrical Discharge' and begins character creation.\",\n      \"milestone: artie_death = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: system_entry = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: chips_retrieved = DONE\",\n      \"location: System Void\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Rusty Shortsword (Prop) (carried, hand_right)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Smartphone (dead) (stowed, pockets)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Wallet (stowed, pockets)\",\n      \"Fizz introduced herself as the legally mandated System Guide.\",\n      \"Artie attempted to allocate 80 points into Vitality to become a 'tank'.\",\n      \"Residual electricity from the Snack-O-Matic caused a UI malfunction.\",\n      \"All 100 stat points were forced into Critical Probability and Multiplier.\",\n      \"The System assigned the 'Glass Cannon' trait and set Artie's HP to 1/1.\",\n      \"The System Void dissolved, beginning Artie's transport to the game world.\",\n      \"milestone: stat_allocation = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: tutorial_arrival = NOT_YET\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Rusty Shortsword (Prop) (carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"status: CHAR_ARTIE -> 1 HP (hard constraint)\",\n      \"status: CHAR_ARTIE -> 100% Critical Hit Rate (hard constraint)\"\n    ],\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie met his System Guide, Fizz, in the flickering blue void of character creation.\",\n      \"A residual electrical surge from his death glitched the UI, dumping all his stat points into Critical Probability instead of Vitality.\",\n      \"The System finalized his build as a 'Glass Cannon' with 100% Crit and a precarious 1 HP before transport began.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"milestone: artie_death = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: system_entry = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: chips_retrieved = DONE\",\n      \"location: System Void\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Rusty Shortsword (Prop) (carried, hand_right)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Smartphone (dead) (stowed, pockets)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Wallet (stowed, pockets)\",\n      \"milestone: stat_allocation = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: tutorial_arrival = NOT_YET\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Rusty Shortsword (Prop) (carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"status: CHAR_ARTIE -> 1 HP (hard constraint)\",\n      \"status: CHAR_ARTIE -> 100% Critical Hit Rate (hard constraint)\"\n    ],\n    \"pending_story_rollups\": [],\n    \"story_so_far\": []\n  },\n  \"world\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [],\n    \"cast_present_ids\": [\n      \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"CHAR_FIZZ\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"System Void\",\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"\n    ],\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie met his System Guide, Fizz.\",\n      \"A residual electrical charge from Artie's death glitched the character creation UI.\",\n      \"Artie's stat points were accidentally dumped into Critical Probability.\",\n      \"The System balanced Artie's 100% Crit rate by reducing his HP to 1.\",\n      \"Artie acquired the 'Glass Cannon' Legendary/Cursed trait.\"\n    ],\n    \"time\": {}\n  }\n}\n\nOutput (required, no code fences):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n"
