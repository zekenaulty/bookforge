PROSE:

The bag of ‘Vinegar Vengeance’ chips didn't just hang there; it mocked him. It was suspended by a single, microscopic polymer fiber, dangling from the metal coil of Slot B4 like a suicidal mountain climber who’d had second thoughts halfway down the cliff.

Arthur ‘Artie’ Penhaligon leaned his forehead against the cool, smudge-streaked glass of the Snack-O-Matic 3000. He could see his own reflection: a man whose soul had been slowly replaced by spreadsheets and lukewarm coffee. His Silk Tie, a gift from an ex-girlfriend who had cited his "lack of ambition" as a deal-breaker, felt like a silk noose.

"Come on," Artie whispered, his breath fogging the glass. "I gave you the three quarters. I even gave you the nickel with the weird dent in it. Just... drop."

The machine hummed, a low-frequency vibration that seemed to vibrate Artie’s very teeth. In his left hand, the remaining Loose Change clinked—a depressing tally of his net worth at 4:15 PM on a Tuesday. His right hand gripped his Leather Wallet, the imitation cowhide worn smooth from years of being pulled out to pay for things that brought him no joy.

[HP: 10/10]

The little floating bar in the corner of his vision—something he’d always attributed to a persistent ocular migraine caused by the fluorescent lights of the accounting department—flickered. He’d seen it for years. Doctors called it "stress-induced visual phenomena." Artie called it his "give-a-damn meter." Today, it felt particularly fragile.

He checked his watch. He had exactly six minutes before the quarterly earnings meeting, a gathering designed to transform human hope into PowerPoint slides. He needed those chips. They were the only thing standing between him and a total breakdown.

"Last warning, you overpriced box of rust," Artie muttered.

He shifted his weight. His Data Entry skill, currently sitting at a mediocre Level 4, told him that the probability of the bag falling on its own was approximately 0.03%. His Sarcasm skill, a robust Level 10, suggested he should probably just start eating the glass.

He chose a third option: physical violence.

Artie pulled back his foot—shod in a sensible, non-slip loafer—and delivered a sharp kick to the base of the Snack-O-Matic. 

The machine groaned. The coil in Slot B4 gave a pathetic little shimmy. The bag of chips stayed put.

"Oh, you want to play dirty?"

Artie shoved his Leather Wallet into his pocket and grabbed the sides of the machine. He began to rock it. It was a dangerous game—the safety stickers clearly depicted a stick figure being crushed by a falling vending machine—but Artie was past caring. If he was going to go out, he was going to go out covered in salt and malt vinegar.

"Give. Me. My. Chips!"

He gave the machine a final, desperate heave. 

Something inside the Snack-O-Matic 3000 snapped. It wasn't the coil. It was something deeper, something electrical and angry. A shower of blue sparks erupted from the coin slot, dancing across Artie’s sweaty palms.

[Warning: Critical System Failure Detected]

"What?" Artie blinked. The text wasn't in his head this time. It was projected onto the glass, bright and neon-green. 

The humming sound escalated into a scream. The floor beneath Artie’s feet began to vibrate with enough force to rattle his bones. He tried to let go, but his hands were fused to the metal frame by a sudden, localized gravitational anomaly—or perhaps just a really bad short circuit.

[Environmental Hazard: Electrical Surge (High Voltage)]
[-2 HP]

"Ow! Dammit!" Artie yelled. The Loose Change in his left hand grew white-hot. He felt the Silk Tie around his neck begin to singe.

[HP: 8/10]

The breakroom lights flickered and died, leaving only the frantic, pulsing glow of the vending machine. The ‘Vinegar Vengeance’ chips finally fell, but they didn't hit the bottom tray. They dissolved into a cloud of glowing pixels before they even reached the flap.

"My chips..." Artie gasped. 

The machine wasn't just sparking anymore. It was bleeding light. A jagged crack formed in the air right in front of the glass, a rift of pure static that smelled like ozone and burnt hair. 

[Direct Interface Initiated...]
[Unauthorized User Detected]
[Applying Correction...]

"Correction? Wait, I just wanted a snack!"

A bolt of pure, unadulterated energy shot out from the rift, hitting Artie square in the chest. It felt like being kicked by a mule made of lightning. He flew backward, his body slamming into the breakroom table. The impact was secondary to the feeling of his very atoms being rearranged by a drunk architect.

[Critical Hit!]
[-10 HP]

Artie’s vision went white. The floating bar in the corner of his eye didn't just dip; it shattered.

[HP: 0/10]

[Status: Deceased]

"Well," Artie thought, his consciousness beginning to drift like a balloon with a slow leak. "At least I don't have to go to that meeting."

The world didn't go black. It went... null. 

The sensation of the breakroom floor vanished. The smell of burnt coffee and carpet cleaner was replaced by a sterile, absolute nothingness. Artie felt himself floating, though 'floating' implied a direction. This was just existence without the inconvenience of geometry.

He looked down at his hands. They were translucent, shimmering with a faint blue light. His Leather Wallet, his Loose Change, even his singed Silk Tie—they were all there, but they looked like wireframe models in a half-rendered video game.

[System Notification]
[Welcome, User: ARTHUR PENHALIGON]
[Analyzing Life Metrics...]
[Result: Exceptionally Average]

"Average? I'll have you know I once won a regional spelling bee," Artie said, his voice echoing in a way that suggested the 'room' he was in was roughly the size of forever.

[Spelling Bee: Irrelevant.]
[Data Entry Level 4: Pathetic.]
[Sarcasm Level 10: Noted.]

A massive, glowing screen manifested in the void before him. It was covered in sliders, numbers, and categories that made his head spin. At the top, in bold, flickering letters, it read:

[CHARACTER CREATION: PHASE 1]

"Character creation?" Artie squinted at the screen. "Is this heaven? Because if heaven is a UI, I’m going to be very disappointed."

[Heaven is currently undergoing maintenance. You have been redirected to the System Integration Hub.]
[Please select your starting attributes. Note: Due to the 'Vending Machine Incident,' your account has been flagged for 'Anomalous Death Bonus.']

Artie drifted closer to the screen. He saw Strength, Agility, Intelligence—the usual suspects. They were all set to 10. Balanced. Boring. 

"Anomalous Death Bonus, huh?" Artie reached out a translucent finger. "Does that mean I get better chips?"

[Bonus applies to 'Luck' and 'Critical' sub-routines.]
[Warning: Manual adjustment of stats is permanent. Please choose wisely.]

Artie looked at his 10 HP. It looked so small. So fragile. He looked at the 'Crit' stat, which was currently a tiny, flickering icon at the bottom of the screen.

"If I’m going to be stuck in a game," Artie muttered, "I might as well make it interesting. Nobody ever remembers the guy who played it safe."

He reached for the sliders, but before he could touch them, the void began to shake again. A voice, much louder and far less polite than the System notifications, boomed through the emptiness.

"USER 992-DELTA! YOU ARE LATE FOR YOUR ALLOCATION!"

Artie spun around—or tried to—but there was nothing to see but the white light of the screen. 

"I'm working on it!" Artie shouted back. "The UI is clunky!"

[Alert: External Interference Detected.]
[Accelerating Character Creation...]

The sliders began to move on their own, dancing to the rhythm of the void's tremors. Artie watched in horror as his Strength dropped to 1. His Agility dropped to 1. His Intelligence, his Stamina, his Charisma—all of them plummeted toward the bottom of the scale.

"Hey! Stop that! I didn't click that!"

[Points Reallocated to: CRITICAL HIT RATE]
[Current Rate: 100%]

"One hundred percent?" Artie stared at the screen. "What about my health? What about my defense?"

[HP: 1/1]

The screen flashed a blinding, violent red. 

[Build Finalized: THE GLASS CANNON]
[Title Acquired: Statistical Anomaly]

"One HP? You're sending me into a world with one HP?" Artie screamed at the void. "A stiff breeze will kill me! A slightly aggressive squirrel will be my boss fight!"

[Integration in 3... 2... 1...]

The void collapsed. The silence was replaced by the chirping of birds, the rustle of leaves, and the terrifyingly loud sound of Artie’s own heartbeat. 

He wasn't in the breakroom anymore. And he definitely wasn't in accounting.
