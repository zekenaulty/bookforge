He stood at the threshold, the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion pulsing with a neon yellow radiance so aggressive it made the ancient, moss-covered stones look like they were at a bad rave.\n\n\"Is the glow strictly necessary?\" Artie whispered, his voice echoing off the damp walls. He clutched the Participation Trophy in his left hand, the golden plastic wings of the award catching the cloak\u2019s garish light. \"I feel like a walking 'Kill Me' sign. Which, considering my health bar, is redundant.\"\n\n[Aggro Meter: 99% (CRITICAL DENSITY)]\n\n\"It\u2019s not just a sign, Artie. It\u2019s a lighthouse for the unliving,\" Fizz said, her tiny blue form flickering as she hovered near his ear. She left a trail of pixelated dust in the air. \"The Cloak of the Cowardly Lion provides a massive evasion boost, but the trade-off is that every monster within three zip codes knows exactly where you are and what you\u2019re wearing. Also, you look ridiculous.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the fashion critique, Fizz. I\u2019ll be sure to mention it in my obituary,\" Artie muttered. He took a step forward, his sneakers squeaking on the stone floor.\n\nThe interior of the crypt was a masterpiece of budget-friendly dungeon design: flickering torches, the smell of wet calcium, and a floor plan that seemed to have been designed by someone who hated straight lines. As Artie rounded the first corner, the \"lighthouse\" effect of his cloak hit its first customers.\n\nThree skeletons, their bones bleached a dull grey, rattled to life in a nearby alcove. They didn't have eyes, but they certainly had a focus. They turned in unison, their jawbones clicking.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 100% (MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE)]\n[Warning: You have entered the detection radius of: Crypt Skirmisher (Lvl 4) x3]\n\n\"Oh, look, fans,\" Artie said, his heart hammering against his ribs. He had 1 HP. If one of those rusted scimitars so much as grazed his Corporate ID Badge, he was going to be a very flat, very dead office drone.\n\nThe first skeleton lunged. It was a clumsy, overhead swing that should have been easy to avoid, but Artie\u2019s feet felt like they were glued to the floor. Then, the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion twitched.\n\nA sudden, violent jerk pulled Artie\u2019s torso three inches to the right. The scimitar whistled past his ear, cutting through the space where his head had been a millisecond prior.\n\n[Evasion Proc! (Cloak of the Cowardly Lion)]\n[Status: Coward's Shame (Active) - Your dignity has decreased, but your life has not.]\n\n\"Whoa!\" Artie stumbled, his body moving with a twitchy, involuntary grace. \"The cloak... it just moved me. I didn't even think about it.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s the 'Coward's Shame' in action,\" Fizz chirped, dodging a stray rib bone. \"It bypasses your sluggish human reflexes and replaces them with pure, unadulterated terror-based automation. Don't think, Artie. Just... vibrate.\"\n\nThe second skeleton stepped forward, thrusting its blade. Artie\u2019s knees buckled\u2014not from fear, but because the cloak forced him into a deep, undignified squat. The blade passed over his head.\n\n[Evasion Proc! (Cloak of the Cowardly Lion)]\n\n\"This is humiliating,\" Artie said, his face inches from the dusty floor. He saw the third skeleton preparing to strike. It was drawing back its arm in a slow, deliberate arc.\n\nWait.\n\nArtie watched the skeleton\u2019s feet. Clack-clack. Pause. Clack-clack. Pause.\n\nThe skeleton swung. Artie didn't wait for the cloak to jerk him this time. He stepped left on the Pause. The scimitar struck the wall with a shower of sparks.\n\n\"Fizz, did you see that?\" Artie asked, his eyes narrowing as he watched the trio reset.\n\n\"See what? Your life flashing before your eyes? I\u2019ve seen it three times in the last minute,\" she replied.\n\n\"No. The timing. They\u2019re... they\u2019re on a beat.\"\n\nThe skeletons moved again. It was a synchronized dance of decay. Step-step-swing. Step-step-swing. It was exactly like the rhythm of the data entry software Artie had used for six years\u2014a predictable, looping sequence of inputs.\n\n\"One, two, three, dodge,\" Artie whispered. He watched the first skeleton. One, two, three... He stepped back. The blade missed by a mile. He didn't even need the evasion proc.\n\n\"It\u2019s a rhythm game,\" Artie realized, a manic grin spreading across his face. \"This isn't combat. It\u2019s Dance Dance Revolution with higher stakes and worse music.\"\n\n[Skill Gained: Pattern Recognition (Rank G)]\n[Description: You\u2019ve realized that the world is just a series of predictable loops. Congratulations on being slightly more observant than a rock.]\n\n\"Okay, boys,\" Artie said, adjusting his grip on the Participation Trophy. \"Let\u2019s see if you can keep up with the tempo.\"\n\nHe stepped into the center of the three skeletons. One, two, three, pivot. He spun, the neon yellow cloak flaring out like a radioactive tutu. A scimitar passed under his arm. One, two, three, slide. He glided past the second skeleton, his sneakers chirping on the stone.\n\n[Evasion Proc!]\n[Evasion Proc!]\n[Evasion Proc!]\n\nThe damage numbers didn't appear because nothing was hitting him. Instead, the air was filled with the sound of rusted metal hitting stone and the frantic clicking of skeleton teeth.\n\n\"You\u2019re actually doing it,\" Fizz said, sounding genuinely surprised. \"You\u2019re gaming the system by... counting?\"\n\n\"In my old life, I processed four thousand spreadsheets a week, Fizz. I know a loop when I see one,\" Artie said. He ducked under a horizontal slash, his neon glow illuminating the frustrated movements of the undead. \"These guys are running on a 120-BPM combat script. It\u2019s almost insulting.\"\n\nHe began to hum a jaunty, synthesized tune under his breath, matching his steps to the skeletons' clacking bones. He was no longer a fugitive; he was the conductor of a very boney orchestra.\n\n\"Next stop, the boss,\" Artie said, sliding between the last two skeletons and heading deeper into the crypt. \"I hope

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nUI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says \"always include\".\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it unless explicitly removing a stale fact with REMOVE and restating the current truth.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v2\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\":

        "content": "# REPAIR\n\nFix the scene based on lint issues.\nSummaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\nTimeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: pre-scene invariants and summary facts are binding unless the Scene Card depicts a change. If this scene changes a durable fact, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value and remove the old entry.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n\n- must_stay_true removal (mandatory when a durable fact is superseded):\n  - Add \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" in summary_update.must_stay_true.\n  - Place REMOVE lines before the new final invariant.\n  - REMOVE lines also apply to key_facts_ring (purge stale facts from continuity).\n\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- Inventory posture reconciliation:\n  - If inventory/containers change (held/stowed/container), must_stay_true must be updated to the final posture.\n  - Add REMOVE lines for prior inventory/container invariants before the new final entries.\n  - Use canonical invariant formats:\n    - inventory: CHAR_X -> <item display_name> (status=held|carried|equipped|stowed, container=hand_left|hand_right|<container>)\n    - container: <container> (owner=CHAR_X, contents=[<item display_name>, ...])\nFor held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\nContinuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.\n- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.\n- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.\n- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI gate: only include bracketed UI blocks when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If false, remove or rephrase UI blocks into narrative prose.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or a short parenthetical annotation (e.g., (locked), (Warning: ...)).\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nCanonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\nIf item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for authoritative labels and custody terms.\nUse item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If a durable appearance change occurs in this scene, record it in character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- APPEARANCE_CHECK is required in COMPLIANCE for each cast_present_id (4-8 tokens from atoms/marks).\n\nNaming repairs:\n- If lint flags an item naming issue, fix it with minimal edits.\n- Do not remove humor; simply anchor the item (add display_name near first mention) and ensure custody-change sentences include the display_name.\n- Do not rename item_id or registry fields; only adjust prose wording.\nsummary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\nSTATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\nmust_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\nIf state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\nEnforce scene-card durable constraints: `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\nRespect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`.\n\n- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):\n  - If timeline_scope != \"present\" OR ontological_scope != \"real\", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).\n  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.\n  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category=\"timeline_override\".\n\nReturn corrected prose plus a corrected state_patch JSON block.\n\nOutput format (required, no code fences, no commentary):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n\nAPPEARANCE_CHECK:\n- CHAR_ID: <4-8 tokens from atoms/marks>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}]\n\n- All *_updates arrays must contain objects; never emit bare strings as array entries.\n- JSON shape guardrails (strict, do not deviate):\n  - character_updates MUST be an array of objects.\n    - INVALID: \"character_updates\": {\"character_id\": \"CHAR_X\"}\n    - VALID: \"character_updates\": [{\"character_id\": \"CHAR_X\"}]\n  - character_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects with character_id.\n    - INVALID: \"character_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {...}}\n    - VALID: \"character_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"character_id\": \"CHAR_X\", \"set\": {...}}]\n  - summary_update fields must be arrays of strings.\n    - INVALID: \"summary_update\": {\"last_scene\": \"text\"}\n    - VALID: \"summary_update\": {\"last_scene\": [\"text\"], \"key_events\": [\"...\"], \"must_stay_true\": [\"...\"], \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\"...\"]}\n\n  - appearance_updates MUST be an object under character_updates.\n    - INVALID: \"appearance_updates\": [{\"set\": {...}}] OR \"appearance_updates\": {\"marks_add\": [...]}\n    - VALID: \"appearance_updates\": {\"set\": {\"marks_add\": [{\"name\": \"Singed Hair\", \"location\": \"head\", \"durability\": \"durable\"}]}, \"reason\": \"...\"}\n\n- character_updates.containers must be an array of objects with at least: container, owner, contents (array).\n- Durable-state mutation blocks are mandatory when applicable:\n- Required fields for durable registry entries (when creating NEW ids or filling missing required fields):\n  - item_registry_updates MUST be an array of objects.

Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_device_id, replacement_of.\n  - custodian must be a non-null string id/scope (character id or \"world\"). Never use null.\n    - INVALID: \"custodian\": null\n    - VALID: \"custodian\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\" or \"world\"\n  - owner_scope must be \"character\" or \"world\" and must match the custodian scope.\n  - plot_device_updates: set must include name, custody_scope, custody_ref, activation_state, linked_threads, constraints, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n\n- Transfer vs registry conflict rule (must follow):\n  - If you create a NEW item in item_registry_updates with final custodian already set (e.g., CHAR_ARTIE), DO NOT emit transfer_updates for that item.\n  - If you emit transfer_updates for a NEW item, the registry entry must start with custodian=\"world\" and then transfer to the character.\n  - expected_before must match the registry entry at the moment of transfer (after any registry update that applies before it).  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects; never an object with an `updates` field.\n\n  - inventory_alignment_updates[*].set MUST be an object (not a list).\n    - INVALID: \"set\": []\n    - VALID:   \"set\": {\"inventory\": [...], \"containers\": [...]}\n- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.\n- If you mutate durable state, do not leave the same mutation only in prose.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n- appearance_updates: when a durable appearance change happens, include appearance_updates on the relevant character_updates entry.\n\n  - appearance_updates MUST be an object, not an array.\n    - INVALID: \"appearance_updates\": [{\"set\": {...}, \"reason\": \"...\"}]\n    - VALID: \"appearance_updates\": {\"set\": {\"marks_add\": [{\"name\": \"Singed Hair\", \"location\": \"head\", \"durability\": \"durable\"}]}, \"reason\": \"...\"}\n\n  - appearance_updates.set may include atoms and marks only (canonical truth).\n    - Do NOT put marks_add at the top level; it belongs under set.\n    - Use set.marks_add / set.marks_remove for marks changes.\n    - Use set.atoms for atom changes.\n  - appearance_updates.reason is required (brief, factual).\n  - Do NOT set summary or art text in appearance_updates (derived after acceptance)\n  - Each entry must include character_id, chapter, scene, inventory (full current list), containers (full current list), invariants_add (array), persona_updates (array).\n  - character_updates.inventory MUST be an array of objects, never string item ids.\n  - Inventory object shape: {\"item\":

\"contents\": [\"ITEM_id\", \"...\"]}.\n  - If you have a single persona update, still wrap it in an array of strings.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger and invariants using standard phrasing, e.g.:\n  - Avoid numeric mechanics in must_stay_true; store them in continuity system updates instead.\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> shard (carried, container=satchel)\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> longsword (carried, container=hand_right)\n  - container: satchel (owner=CHAR_example, contents=[shard, maps])\n  - milestone: shard_bind = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - milestone: maps_acquired =

He stood at the threshold, the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion pulsing with a neon yellow radiance so aggressive it made the ancient, moss-covered stones look like they were at a bad rave. \n\n\"Is the glow strictly necessary?\" Artie whispered, his voice echoing off the damp walls. He clutched the Participation Trophy in his left hand, the golden plastic wings of the \"award\" catching the cloak\u2019s garish light. \"I feel like a walking 'Kill Me' sign. Which, considering my health bar, is redundant.\"\n\n[Aggro Meter: 99% (CRITICAL DENSITY)]\n\n\"It\u2019s not just a sign, Artie. It\u2019s a lighthouse for the unliving,\" Fizz said, her tiny blue form flickering as she hovered near his ear. She left a trail of pixelated dust in the air. \"The Cloak of the Cowardly Lion provides a massive evasion boost, but the trade-off is that every monster within three zip codes knows exactly where you are and what you\u2019re wearing. Also, you look ridiculous.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the fashion critique, Fizz. I\u2019ll be sure to mention it in my obituary,\" Artie muttered. He took a step forward, his sneakers squeaking on the stone floor. \n\nThe interior of the crypt was a masterpiece of budget-friendly dungeon design: flickering torches, the smell of wet calcium, and a floor plan that seemed to have been designed by someone who hated straight lines. As Artie rounded the first corner, the \"lighthouse\" effect of his cloak hit its first customers.\n\nThree skeletons, their bones bleached a dull grey, rattled to life in a nearby alcove. They didn't have eyes, but they certainly had a focus. They turned in unison, their jawbones clicking.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 100% (MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE)]\n[Warning: You have entered the detection radius of: Crypt Skirmisher (Lvl 4) x3]\n\n\"Oh, look, fans,\" Artie said, his heart hammering against his ribs. He had 1 HP. If one of those rusted scimitars so much as grazed his Corporate ID Badge, he was going to be a very flat, very dead office drone.\n\nThe first skeleton lunged. It was a clumsy, overhead swing that should have been easy to avoid, but Artie\u2019s feet felt like they were glued to the floor. Then, the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion twitched.\n\nA sudden, violent jerk pulled Artie\u2019s torso three inches to the right. The scimitar whistled past his ear, cutting through the space where his head had been a millisecond prior.\n\n[Evasion Proc! (Cloak of the Cowardly Lion)]\n[Status: Coward's Shame (Active) - Your dignity has decreased, but your life has not.]\n\n\"Whoa!\" Artie stumbled, his body moving with a twitchy, involuntary grace. \"The cloak... it just moved me. I didn't even think about it.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s the 'Coward's Shame' in action,\" Fizz chirped, dodging a stray rib bone. \"It bypasses your sluggish human reflexes and replaces them with pure, unadulterated terror-based automation. Don't think, Artie. Just... vibrate.\"\n\nThe second skeleton stepped forward, thrusting its blade. Artie\u2019s knees buckled\u2014not from fear, but because the cloak forced him into a deep, undignified squat. The blade passed over his head.\n\n[Evasion Proc! (Cloak of the Cowardly Lion)]\n\n\"This is humiliating,\" Artie said, his face inches from the dusty floor. He saw the third skeleton preparing to strike. It was drawing back its arm in a slow, deliberate arc.\n\nWait.\n\nArtie watched the skeleton\u2019s feet. *Clack-clack. Pause. Clack-clack. Pause.*\n\nThe skeleton swung. Artie didn't wait for the cloak to jerk him this time. He stepped left on the *Pause*. The scimitar struck the wall with a shower of sparks.\n\n\"Fizz, did you see that?\" Artie asked, his eyes narrowing as he watched the trio reset. \n\n\"See what? Your life flashing before your eyes? I\u2019ve seen it three times in the last minute,\" she replied.\n\n\"No. The timing. They\u2019re... they\u2019re on a beat.\"\n\nThe skeletons moved again. It was a synchronized dance of decay. *Step-step-swing. Step-step-swing.* It was exactly like the rhythm of the data entry software Artie had used for six years\u2014a predictable, looping sequence of inputs.\n\n\"One, two, three, dodge,\" Artie whispered. He watched the first skeleton. *One, two, three...* He stepped back. The blade missed by a mile. He didn't even need the evasion proc.\n\n\"It\u2019s a rhythm game,\" Artie realized, a manic grin spreading across his face. \"This isn't combat. It\u2019s *Dance Dance Revolution* with higher stakes and worse music.\"\n\n[Skill Gained: Pattern Recognition (Rank G)]\n[Description: You\u2019ve realized that the world is just a series of predictable loops. Congratulations on being slightly more observant than a rock.]\n\n\"Okay, boys,\" Artie said, adjusting his grip on the Participation Trophy. \"Let\u2019s see if you can keep up with the tempo.\"\n\nHe stepped into the center of the three skeletons. *One, two, three, pivot.* He spun, the neon yellow cloak flaring out like a radioactive tutu. A scimitar passed under his arm. *One, two, three, slide.* He glided past the second skeleton, his sneakers chirping on the stone. \n\n[Evasion Proc!]\n[Evasion Proc!]\n[Evasion Proc!]\n\nThe damage numbers didn't appear because nothing was hitting him. Instead, the air was filled with the sound of rusted metal hitting stone and the frantic clicking of skeleton teeth.\n\n\"You\u2019re actually doing it,\" Fizz said, sounding genuinely surprised. \"You\u2019re gaming the system by... counting?\"\n\n\"In my old life, I processed four thousand spreadsheets a week, Fizz. I know a loop when I see one,\" Artie said. He ducked under a horizontal slash, his neon glow illuminating the frustrated movements of the undead. \"These guys are running on a 120-BPM combat script. It\u2019s almost insulting.\"\n\nHe began to hum a jaunty, synthesized tune under his breath, matching his steps to the skeletons' clacking bones. He was no longer a fugitive; he was the conductor of a very boney orchestra. \n\n\"Next stop, the boss,\" Artie said, sliding between the last two skeletons and heading deeper into the crypt. \"I hope he likes techno.\"\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"characters\": {\n    \"count\": 5,\n    \"status\": \"READY\",\n    \"updated_at\": \"2026-02-13T07:51:22Z\"\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 2,\n    \"scene\": 4\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"global_continuity_system_state\": {\n    \"active_mechanics\": [\n      \"HP\",\n      \"Crit Rate\",\n      \"Point Buy\",\n      \"System Notification\",\n      \"Damage Number\",\n      \"Level Up\",\n      \"Aggro Meter\"\n    ],\n    \"aggro_meter\": 99,\n    \"reality_stability\": 40,\n    \"world_type\": \"dungeon_interior\"\n  },\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_002/scene_004.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"DRAFTING\",\n  \"summary\": {\n    \"chapter_so_far\": [\n      \"Artie's attempt to fix his aggro problem backfired, making the Participation Trophy a permanent part of his build.\",\n      \"Artie successfully bypassed a high-level security lock using his crit glitch, revealing the gear he needs to survive.\",\n      \"Artie acquired the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion, gaining a massive evasion boost at the cost of his dignity.\",\n      \"Artie escaped the collapsing merchant shop and is now a fugitive in the backstreets of Oakhaven.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_facts_ring\": [\n      \"Artie gained the permanent 'The Eternal Participant' status.\",\n      \"The shop was surrounded by aggro-crazed mobs, forcing Artie to look for a back exit.\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Participation Trophy (status=held, container=hand_left, soul-bound=TRUE)\",\n      \"milestone: eternal_participant_status_gained = DONE\",\n      \"The Aggro Meter reached 99%, triggering a critical density of mobs outside the shop.\",\n      \"Artie used 'Percussive Maintenance' on the High-Level Shop Lock.\",\n      \"The lock was destroyed by a 'NaN' damage critical hit.\",\n      \"The Cloak of the Cowardly Lion was revealed on the pedestal.\",\n      \"Artie's 'Gate-Crasher' title became active.\",\n      \"Artie's Aggro Meter is at 99% (CRITICAL DENSITY).\",\n      \"Artie possesses the 'Gate-Crasher' title (Active).\",\n      \"milestones: shop_lock_vaporized and cloak_of_the_cowardly_lion_revealed are DONE.\",\n      \"injury: vending machine scar on right knuckle\",\n      \"Artie equipped the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion (+50 Evasion, -100 Dignity).\",\n      \"Artie survived two lethal attacks via Evasion procs (50% chance) against a butcher and a thief.\",\n      \"The Aggro Meter remained at 99% Critical Density throughout the escape.\",\n      \"Artie activated the Coward's Sprint passive, increasing his movement speed by 20% while fleeing.\",\n      \"Barnaby's Bargains & Blunders collapsed, temporarily blocking the mob's pursuit.\",\n      \"Artie escaped into the backstreets of Oakhaven as a neon-yellow fugitive.\",\n      \"location: Oakhaven -
