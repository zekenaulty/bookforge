PROSE:

The bell above the door chimed with a cheery, synthesized ring that felt entirely too optimistic for a man with a single hit point and a literal beacon for murder clutched in his hand. Artie stepped into "Barnaby’s Bargains & Blunders," his boots scuffing against floorboards that looked like they’d been rendered with a low-resolution texture pack. 

[HP: 1/1]
[Aggro Meter: 94% (Status: Cooling...)]

"Cooling, my ass," Artie muttered, shifting his grip on the Participation Trophy. The gold-plated plastic felt warm—unpleasantly so—and it emitted a low-frequency hum that made his teeth ache. It wasn't just an item; it was a rhythmic headache that told every monster in a three-mile radius exactly where to find a squishy, Level 2 snack.

Fizz hovered near his shoulder, her neon blue form flickering. Her pixelated trail left a faint shimmer in the dusty air of the shop. "Look, Artie, the math is simple. Merchants in Oakhaven are programmed to accept almost any loot as long as it has a rarity tag. You dump the trophy, the 'Monster Beacon' status falls off, and we can go back to being regular, non-murdered anomalies."

"Regular is a stretch," Artie said, eyeing the merchant behind the counter. 

The man, presumably Barnaby, was a stout NPC with a mustache so symmetrical it had to be a procedural asset. He was currently polishing a rusted buckler, but as Artie approached, the merchant’s eyes drifted toward the Participation Trophy. Then they drifted toward Artie’s face. Then they widened.

[Aggro Meter: 95% (Warning: Social Tension Rising)]

"Welcome to—" Barnaby started, then stopped. He sniffed the air. "By the Great D20, boy, what are you carrying? You smell like a world boss and a bad debt."

Artie didn't waste time with pleasantries. He’d spent ten years in data entry; he knew how to cut through the fluff. He slammed the Participation Trophy onto the wooden counter. The hum of the item grew louder, a vibrating *thrum-thrum-thrum* that caused a display of glass potions to rattle precariously.

"I want to sell this," Artie said. "Give me five copper. Give me a stale cracker. Just take it out of my inventory."

Barnaby leaned over the counter, squinting. A translucent window popped up between them, visible only to Artie.

[Trade Interface: Initiated]
[Item: Participation Trophy (Cursed)]
[Value: 0 Gold, 0 Silver, 1 'Get Out of My Shop' Look]

"I can't take that," Barnaby whispered, his voice trembling. He reached out a hand, then yanked it back as if the trophy were made of white-hot maggot-fire. "That’s not just loot. That’s... that’s a liability. Look at the meter, lad!"

Artie glanced up. The red bar above his head was pulsing.

[Aggro Meter: 97% (Alert: Local Entities Becoming Hostile)]

Outside the shop window, Artie saw a stray dog stop in the street. It bared its teeth, its eyes turning a glowing, aggressive red. A passing guard paused, his hand drifting toward the hilt of his sword, his gaze fixed on the shop’s front door with sudden, inexplicable loathing.

"It’s just a trophy!" Artie hissed. "It says I participated! That’s a good thing! Positive reinforcement!"

"It’s a beacon!" Fizz chirped, though she looked worried. "Artie, try the 'Force Sell' exploit. Use your Data Entry skill to bypass the confirmation prompt. If you can move the item data to his side of the ledger before the System realizes it’s soul-bound—"

"Soul-bound?" Artie’s heart hammered against his ribs—a dangerous activity for a man with 1 HP. "You didn't mention soul-bound."

"I was eighty percent sure it wasn't!" Fizz countered, her pixels buzzing. "The other twenty percent was... well, the 'Cursed' tag is a bit of a wildcard."

Artie ignored the mounting panic and focused on the counter. He reached out, grabbing the Participation Trophy with his left hand, his thumb brushing the vending machine scar on his right knuckle as he tried to shove the item toward Barnaby’s chest. 

"Take. The. Deal," Artie commanded.

[Skill Check: Data Entry (Rank F) vs. Merchant Willpower]
[Result: Critical Success! (100% Crit Rate Applied)]

The world stuttered. For a fraction of a second, the Participation Trophy turned into a string of raw hexadecimal code. Artie felt the weight of the item leave his hand. The 'Trade Confirmed' chime rang out, a beautiful, melodic sound that promised freedom from the hum.

Then, the System screamed.

[ERROR: Invalid Transaction]
[Item 'Participation Trophy' is Soul-Bound to: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[Reason: You didn't just participate; you're the only one left.]

The trophy didn't just reappear in Artie's hand; it manifested with a thunderclap of static. The force of the failed transfer sent a shockwave through the shop. Barnaby was blown backward, hitting a shelf of 'Minor Health Potions' that shattered, drenching him in red liquid that looked suspiciously like strawberry syrup.

[Aggro Meter: 98% (MAXIMUM PROXIMITY ALERT)]

"Out!" Barnaby screamed, scrambling to his feet, his mustache twitching in terror. "Get that thing out of here! You’re bringing the whole zone down on us! I can hear the slimes hitting the walls!"

Artie looked at the door. The scratching sound of claws against wood was unmistakable. Through the glass, he saw the shadows of at least three Level 5 'Rabid Town Dogs' and one very confused, very angry guard.

"I can't drop it!" Artie yelled, shaking his left hand. The Participation Trophy was stuck to his palm like it had been welded there by a god with a sick sense of humor. "It’s part of me now!"

"It’s a permanent status effect," Fizz said, her voice small. "The 'Monster Beacon' isn't coming off, Artie. You aren't just a player anymore. You’re the objective."

[System Notification: New Status Permanent - 'The Eternal Participant']
[Description: You cannot discard the Participation Trophy. You cannot sell it. You are the lighthouse in the storm of RNG. Monsters will always find you. Good luck (You'll need it).]

Artie looked at the trophy, then at his 1/1 HP bar, then at the door as it began to splinter under the weight of the aggro-crazed mobs outside.

"Great," Artie whispered, his hazel eyes reflecting the flickering blue light of his guide. "I’m not a hero. I’m a loot drop that walks like a man."

He gripped the trophy tight, the hum now vibrating through his entire arm. He had 1 HP, a 100% crit rate, and a world that suddenly, collectively, wanted him dead.

"Fizz?"

"Yes, Artie?"

"Remind me to crit the next person who offers me a trophy."

Artie turned toward the back door, the only exit that wasn't currently being besieged by the local wildlife. He didn't have a plan, but he had a very high movement speed fueled by pure, unadulterated terror.
