  "text": "COMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: SC_001_007\nAllowed events: Artie meets the Mayor, Mayor attempts to tax Artie, Artie bluffs about his 1 HP, Artie receives 'The Mayor\u2019s Cut' quest.\nForbidden milestones: Any mention of Vane (not present), any mention of leaving Oakhaven (not yet), any change to Artie's 1 HP status.\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: CHAR_ARTIE -> Broken Tutorial Sword (hand_right), Participation Trophy (hand_left), Linen Tunic (body), Single Copper Coin (pockets). CHAR_MAYOR -> Town Seal (hand_left), Scroll of Tasks (belt_pouch).\n\nPROSE:\nThe Mayor\u2019s office in Oakhaven didn't just smell like power; it smelled like high-resolution rendering and expensive, micro-transactional wax. The walls were lined with shelves of leather-bound ledgers that Artie suspected were actually just physical manifestations of the town\u2019s database. Behind a desk carved from a single, massive block of Obsidian-Oak\u2014a material that looked like it had a very high damage threshold\u2014sat the Mayor.\n\nArtie stood on the plush, crimson carpet, feeling every bit the level-one glitch he was. His right hand was white-knuckled around the hilt of the Broken Tutorial Sword. It was a pathetic weapon, little more than a jagged shard of iron, but it was the only thing between him and the terrifyingly polished reality of this room. In his left hand, the Participation Trophy pulsed with a rhythmic, sickly neon light. The \"Aura of the Beacon\" was currently making the shadows in the corners of the room vibrate with a low-frequency hum that Artie was pretty sure was the sound of every monster in a five-mile radius checking their GPS.\n\nThe Mayor of Oakhaven was a man whose character model was clearly set to 'Opulent.' He wore a silver chain of office that shimmered with a constant stream of scrolling data: [Level 42], [Social Standing: Exalted], [Current Mood: Opportunistic]. He didn't look at Artie; he looked at the space six inches above Artie\u2019s head where his name and title floated.\n\n\"Statistical Anomaly,\" the Mayor whispered, the words sounding like a cash register opening. \"The gate scanner hasn't thrown a Fatal Error like that since the Great Patch of '04. Do you have any idea what you are, Mr. Penhaligon?\"\n\n\"A guy who really needs a chair and maybe a sandwich?\" Artie suggested.\n\n[Stamina: 12/100]\n[Status: Winded (Recovery Rate -50%)]\n\nThe hunger bar in the corner of his vision was flickering a threatening shade of orange, a pixelated stomach growling for sustenance. He kept his posture straight, despite the fact that his legs felt like they were made of overcooked noodles. In a world where a stiff breeze could deplete his entire 1 HP health pool, looking like a \"glass cannon\" was a tactical necessity. Looking like \"shattered glass\" was an invitation for the Mayor to sweep him into a dustpan.\n\n\"You are a walking mint,\" the Mayor said, standing up. He rounded the desk, his eyes locked on Artie\u2019s character sheet\u2014or at least the parts the System hadn't redacted with \"Error 404\" messages. \"A 100% Critical Hit rate. Do you understand the economic implications? Most artisans spend decades trying to reach a five-percent 'Masterwork' proc rate. You? You could tap a piece of raw iron and it would come out a Vorpal Blade just because the System doesn't know how to roll a 'normal' result for you.\"\n\nArtie tightened his grip on the Broken Tutorial Sword. \"I'm more of a 'vaporize the tutorial wolf' kind of guy. I don't do much blacksmithing. Mostly because I don't have a hammer. Or a forge. Or any health.\"\n\n\"You will,\" the Mayor countered, a predatory smile stretching his cheeks. \"Oakhaven is a hub of commerce, and commerce requires stability. Your presence is... unstable. Therefore, the municipal code requires a 'Variance Tax' for all anomalies of Tier 3 or higher. It\u2019s for the safety of the server, you understand.\"\n\n[System Notification: New Quest Offered - The Mayor\u2019s Cut]\n[Objective: Pay 500 Gold in 'Variance Taxes' or provide 10 pieces of 'Crit-Forged' equipment.]\n[Reward: Citizenship, 500 XP, 1x 'Safe Zone' voucher.]\n[Failure: Immediate deportation to the 'Unpatched Wilds'.]\n\n\"Five hundred gold?\" Artie barked, the Participation Trophy nearly slipping from his left hand. \"I have exactly one copper coin and a trophy that makes me a magnet for everything with teeth. I'm not a bank, I'm a target.\"\n\nThe Mayor leaned in, his Level 42 aura pressing against Artie like a physical weight. It was a passive intimidation check, and Artie could feel his 1 HP vibrating in protest. The Mayor\u2019s left hand rested on his Town Seal, a heavy golden stamp that looked like it could deal at least 10-15 blunt damage\u2014more than enough to delete Artie ten times over.\n\n\"Then you'd better start swinging that broken toothpick of yours at something valuable,\" the Mayor said. \"Or perhaps, I could 'invest' in your potential. A small contract. You provide Oakhaven with a guaranteed 'Crit-Output' for our local guild, and I overlook the fact that your HP is...\" He paused, squinting at the blurred red bar above Artie's head. \"Well, it\u2019s remarkably low, isn't it? One might almost say it's a rounding error. A single point?\"\n\nArtie\u2019s heart hammered against his ribs. This was the moment. If the Mayor realized that Artie was a literal one-hit-point wonder, the negotiation was over. The Mayor wouldn't tax him; he\u2019d harvest him like a rare crafting node.\n\n\"It's a specialized build,\" Artie lied, his voice dropping into a low, confident register. He channeled every tech support agent he\u2019d ever argued with. \"The System balances the 100% Crit by compressing my health into a 'Perfect Guard' state. I don't need HP if I never get hit. It\u2019s a high-level optimization. And trust me, you don't want to see what happens when the 'Reflect' damage procs on a 100% Crit build. The last thing that touched me turned into a pile of unformatted metadata.\"\n\nIt was total nonsense\u2014a bluff built on the shaky foundation of the System's own bad math. But the Mayor hesitated. In this world, the weirdest builds were often the most dangerous, and \"Perfect Guard\" sounded like the kind of broken mechanic a developer would forget to patch.\n\n\"A bold claim,\" the Mayor muttered, stepping back and removing his hand from the Town Seal. \"But a Statistical Anomaly is, by definition, an unknown variable. I\u2019ll give you twenty-four hours to find a way to pay that tax, Penhaligon. Until then, you are a guest of Oakhaven. But remember: in this town, we don't worship the gods. We worship the roll. And right now? Your rolls are the only thing keeping you from being recycled into raw data.\"\n\nArtie turned to leave, the Participation Trophy\u2019s neon glow illuminating the Mayor\u2019s greedy expression. As the heavy oak doors clicked shut behind him, Artie let out a breath he didn't know he was holding. He was still holding the Broken Tutorial Sword in his right hand, his knuckles finally beginning to regain their color.\n\nHe was in. He was safe\u2014for now. But the end condition of his stay was clear. He wasn't just a player anymore; he was a walking jackpot. And in a town full of gamblers, someone was eventually going to try and pull the lever.\n\n\"Fizz,\" Artie whispered to the empty air, \"we need to find a way to turn 'breaking the game' into 'paying the rent' before that guy decides to check my 'Perfect Guard' with a crossbow.\"\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present_ids\": [\"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"CHAR_MAYOR\"],\n    \"location\": \"Oakhaven - Mayor's Office\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie met the Mayor of Oakhaven and was threatened with a 'Variance Tax'.\",\n      \"Artie successfully bluffed the Mayor into believing his 1 HP is a 'Perfect Guard' build.\",\n      \"The Mayor offered Artie a quest to pay 500 gold or provide crit-forged gear.\",\n      \"Artie realized that his 100% Crit rate makes him an economic target in Oakhaven.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"character_stat_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"stats\": {\n        \"hp\": 1,\n        \"stamina\": 12,\n        \"mp\": 1\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"run_stat_updates\": {\n    \"stamina\": {\n      \"label\": \"Stamina\",\n      \"description\": \"Physical energy used for sprinting and combat actions.\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 7,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\"item\": \"Broken Tutorial Sword\", \"container\": \"hand_right\", \"status\": \"carried\"},\n        {\"item\": \"Participation Trophy\", \"container\": \"hand_left\", \"status\": \"carried\"},\n        {\"item\": \"Linen Tunic\", \"container\": \"body\", \"status\": \"equipped\"},\n        {\"item\": \"Single Copper Coin\", \"container\": \"pockets\", \"status\": \"stowed\"}\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\"container\": \"hand_right\", \"location\": \"arm_right\", \"contents\": [\"Broken Tutorial Sword\"]},\n        {\"container\": \"hand_left\", \"location\": \"arm_left\", \"contents\": [\"Participation Trophy\"]},\n        {\"container\": \"body\", \"location\": \"torso\", \"contents\": [\"Linen Tunic\"]},\n        {\"container\": \"pockets\", \"location\": \"legs\", \"contents\": [\"Single Copper Coin\"]}\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie is becoming adept at using 'System-speak' to bluff more powerful NPCs.\",\n        \"Artie recognizes that his economic value is as dangerous as his combat potential.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie met with the Mayor of Oakhaven, who identified him as a 'walking mint' due to his 100% Crit rate.\",\n      \"The Mayor attempted to impose a 500-gold 'Variance Tax' on Artie, leading to a high-stakes negotiation.\",\n      \"Artie bluffed about his 1 HP being a 'Perfect Guard' mechanic to prevent the Mayor from attacking him.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Artie entered the Mayor's office while holding the Broken Tutorial Sword and the Participation Trophy.\",\n      \"The Mayor revealed that 'Crits' are a form of currency and industrial standard in Oakhaven.\",\n      \"Artie received the quest 'The Mayor\u2019s Cut' with a 24-hour deadline.\",\n      \"Artie successfully used a 'Perfect Guard' bluff to maintain his social standing.\",\n      \"Artie's stamina was recorded at 12/100, leaving him winded.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"milestone: oakhaven_entry = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: statistical_anomaly_tagged = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: mayor_meeting = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: variance_tax_imposed = DONE\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Broken Tutorial Sword (carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Participation Trophy (carried, container=hand_left)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_MAYOR -> Town Seal (carried, container=hand_left)\",\n      \"Artie has 1 HP and 100% Crit Rate.\",\n      \"The Participation Trophy is soul-bound and cannot be stowed.\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Artie has been 'taxed' by the Mayor of Oakhaven and must find 500 gold in 24 hours.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nMechanics contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and labels (stats/skills) must be sourced from state or explicitly updated in the state_patch. Do not invent numbers or canonical tokens.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the RNG-Hellscape\",\"goal\":\"Introduce Artie and his

and the faint, ozone-heavy scent of a System-monitored climate control. Behind a desk carved from a single block of Obsidian-Oak, the Mayor of Oakhaven sat, his eyes darting between a glowing holographic scroll and the man standing before him.\n\nArtie shifted his weight, his boots leaving faint mud streaks on the plush carpet. In his left hand, the Participation Trophy pulsed with a rhythmic, sickly neon light, its \"Aura of the Beacon\" making the shadows in the corner of the room dance nervously. In his right, he gripped the hilt of the Broken Tutorial Sword, mostly because he didn't have a scabbard and dropping it might accidentally trigger a collision-detection glitch.\n\n\"Statistical Anomaly,\" the Mayor whispered, the words tasting like gold on his tongue. He was a portly man with a silver chain of office that displayed his current Level (42) and Social Standing (Exalted). \"The gate scanner hasn't thrown a Fatal Error like that since the Great Patch of '04. Do you have any idea what you are, Mr. Penhaligon?\"\n\n\"A guy who really needs a chair and maybe a sandwich?\" Artie suggested.\n\n[Stamina: 12/100]\n[Status: Winded (Recovery Rate -50%)]\n\nThe hunger bar in the corner of his vision was flickering a threatening shade of orange. But he kept his posture straight. He couldn't afford to look weak. In a world where a stiff breeze could deplete his entire 1 HP health pool, looking like a \"glass cannon\" was fine. Looking like \"shattered glass\" was a death sentence.\n\n\"You are a walking mint,\" the Mayor said, standing up. He rounded the desk, his eyes locked on Artie\u2019s character sheet\u2014or at least the parts the System hadn't redacted with \"Error 404\" messages. \"A 100% Critical Hit rate. Do you understand the economic implications? Most artisans spend decades trying to reach a 5% 'Masterwork' proc rate. You? You could tap a piece of raw iron and it would come out a Vorpal Blade just because the System doesn't know how to roll a 'normal' result for you.\"\n\n\"I'm more of a 'vaporize the tutorial wolf' kind of guy,\" Artie said, keeping his voice steady. \"I don't do much blacksmithing.\"\n\n\"You will,\" the Mayor countered, a predatory smile stretching his cheeks. \"Oakhaven is a hub of commerce, and commerce requires stability. Your presence is... unstable. Therefore, the municipal code requires a 'Variance Tax' for all anomalies of Tier 3 or higher.\"\n\n[System Notification: New Quest Offered - The Mayor\u2019s Cut]\n[Objective: Pay 500 Gold in 'Variance Taxes' or provide 10 pieces of 'Crit-Forged' equipment.]\n[Reward: Citizenship, 500 XP, 1x 'Safe Zone' voucher.]\n[Failure: Immediate deportation to the 'Unpatched Wilds'.]\n\n\"Five hundred gold?\" Artie barked, nearly dropping the trophy. \"I have exactly one copper coin and a trophy that makes every monster within a three-mile radius want to eat my face. I'm not a bank.\"\n\nThe Mayor leaned in, his Level 42 aura pressing against Artie like a physical weight. \"Then you'd better start swinging that broken toothpick of yours at something valuable. Or perhaps, I could 'invest' in your potential. A small contract. You provide Oakhaven with a guaranteed 'Crit-Output' for our local guild, and I overlook the fact that your HP is...\" He paused, squinting at the blurred red bar above Artie's head. \"Well, it\u2019s remarkably low, isn't it? One might almost say it's a rounding error.\"\n\nArtie\u2019s heart hammered against his ribs. If the Mayor realized that a single poke from his ceremonial Town Seal would result in Artie\u2019s immediate deletion, the negotiation was over. The Mayor wouldn't tax him; he\u2019d harvest him.\n\n\"It's a specialized build,\" Artie lied, his voice dropping into a low, confident register he usually reserved for arguing with tech support. \"The System balances the 100% Crit by compressing my health into a 'Perfect Guard' state. I don't need HP if I never get hit. And trust me, you don't want to see what happens when the 'Reflect' damage procs on a 100% Crit build.\"\n\nIt was total nonsense, a bluff built on the shaky foundation of the System's own bad math. But the Mayor hesitated. In this world, the weirdest builds were often the most dangerous.\n\n\"A bold claim,\" the Mayor muttered, stepping back. \"But a Statistical Anomaly is, by definition, an unknown variable. I\u2019ll give you twenty-four hours to find a way to pay that tax, Penhaligon. Until then, you are a guest of Oakhaven. But remember: in this town, we don't worship the gods. We worship the roll. And right now? Your rolls are the only thing keeping you from being recycled into raw data.\"\n\nArtie turned to leave, the Participation Trophy\u2019s glow illuminating the Mayor\u2019s greedy expression. As the heavy oak doors clicked shut behind him, Artie let out a breath he didn't know he was holding. \n\nHe was in. He was safe\u2014for now. But he was also a marked man. In a town where 'Crits' were currency, he wasn't just a player. He was a jackpot waiting to be hit.\n\n\"Fizz,\" Artie whispered to the empty air, \"we need to find a way to turn 'breaking the game' into 'paying the rent' before that guy decides to check my stats with a crossbow.\"\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"characters\": {\n    \"count\": 5,\n    \"status\": \"READY\",\n    \"updated_at\": \"2026-02-06T21:45:27Z\"\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 7\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_001/scene_007.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"run_stats\": {},\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"DRAFTING\",\n  \"summary\": {\n    \"chapter_so_far\": [\n      \"Artie has died on Earth and entered the System's character creation void after a vending machine accident.\",\n      \"Artie met his guide, Fizz, and reviewed the details of his death.\",\n      \"Artie exploited the character creation system to create a high-variance 'Crit-Only' build.\",\n      \"Artie entered the Whispering Woods and engaged in his first combat encounter.\",\n      \"Artie discovered that the System's rounding mechanics make his 1 HP build extremely fragile.\",\n      \"Artie survived his first combat encounter by accidentally nuking the tutorial zone.\",\n      \"Artie discovered that his crits can overwrite System rules and destroy world objects.\",\n      \"Artie received a cursed Participation Trophy that makes him a magnet for all monsters and projectiles in the area.\",\n      \"Artie reached Oakhaven and was flagged as a Statistical Anomaly by the gate scanners.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_facts_ring\": [\n      \"Artie received the 'Participation Trophy' (Cursed/Soul-bound) as an achievement for causing a Tier 3 System Error.\",\n      \"Fizz identified the trophy's hidden stats: Aura of the Beacon (+500% aggro) and Magnetic Failure (projectile attraction).\",\n      \"A Level 4 Tutorial Wolf and a swarm of other mobs aggroed on Artie due to the trophy's effects.\",\n      \"Artie fled North toward a ravine as the tutorial zone's stability dropped to 84%.\",\n      \"Artie narrowly dodged a slime projectile that curved toward him due to the trophy's Magnetic Failure.\",\n      \"Artie's stamina dropped to 42/100 during the frantic retreat.\",\n      \"milestone: artie_died = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: participation_trophy_acquired = DONE\",\n      \"Artie has 1 HP and 1 MP;
