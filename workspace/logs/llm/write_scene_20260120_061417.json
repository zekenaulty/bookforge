  "text": "PROSE:\nThe sky-glass beneath Kaelen\u2019s palms hummed with a low-frequency vibration that rattled his teeth. It was no longer the translucent blue of the valley\u2019s natural quartz; the shadow-forms he\u2019d just shattered had bled into the silicate, staining the crater floor a bruised, oily black. Every breath was a struggle against the scent of scorched copper and the sulfurous tang of the star\u2019s impact. \n\nHe shifted his weight, and a flare of agony bolted from his shoulder laceration down to his hip. The blood was warm, soaking through his tunic and cooling rapidly in the thin, biting air of the valley floor. He didn't look at the wound. He couldn't afford to. His focus was entirely on the object at the center of the blackened glass: a jagged sliver of white-hot radiance that seemed to vibrate at a speed the human eye wasn't meant to process.\n\nThe star-shard. It didn't cast light so much as it carved holes in the darkness.\n\nKaelen reached out. His fingers trembled, the skin of his hand pale and mapped with grime. As his hand drew closer, the oath-mark on his forearm\u2014once a vibrant, regal purple\u2014throbbed with a rhythmic, light-eating blackness. It felt like a void stitched into his flesh, pulling at his very marrow. The starfall corruption wasn't just in the air or the shadows; it was trying to take root in the mark itself.\n\n\"Yield,\" he wheezed, the word cracking in his dry throat. \n\nHe closed his fingers around the shard.\n\nThe world didn't explode; it imploded. For a heartbeat, the crater vanished, replaced by a blinding, pressurized silence. The shard wasn't cold, nor was it hot in any way Kaelen understood. It was a weightless pressure that surged up his arm like liquid lead. It hit the black oath-mark and the two forces collided with a sound like grinding tectonic plates. \n\nKaelen\u2019s back arched. The scorched skin of his chest felt as though it were being peeled away and re-knitted with silver wire. He could feel the shard\u2019s volatile essence\u2014raw, unrefined, and screaming with the echoes of the void\u2014tearing through his meridians. It sought a path of least resistance, a way to vent its celestial heat, and found only the blackened, corrupted channels of his oath.\n\nHe forced himself to hold on. To let go now was to let the star-essence shatter his physical form and scatter his atoms across the High Spire Valley. He had to bind it. He had to weave the volatile star-stuff into the existing structure of the Starwrought Oath, even if the foundation was crumbling.\n\nHe visualized the binding, not as a delicate lace, but as a cage of iron and will. He dragged the shard\u2019s energy into the center of the black mark on his arm. The void-influence resisted, snapping at the starlight like a wounded beast, but the sheer, pressurized gravity of the shard forced the corruption to yield. The blackness didn't vanish, but it shifted, swirling with the white-hot veins of the shard until the mark on his skin resembled a storm-tossed sky at midnight.\n\nThe pressure snapped. Kaelen collapsed forward, his forehead striking the cold sky-glass. \n\nThe shard was gone, dissolved into the metaphysical architecture of his being. His heart hammered a frantic, uneven rhythm, each beat sending a pulse of cold fire through his veins. The shoulder laceration had stopped bleeding, the edges of the wound cauterized by the sheer proximity of the binding, but the ache remained\u2014a deep, structural fatigue that suggested he had traded years of his life for these few seconds of survival.\n\nHe lay there for a long moment, listening to the wind whistle over the rim of the crater. The shadows were gone for now, but the sky-glass remained black, a permanent scar on the valley floor. The starfall corruption was spreading, and he was now a vessel for the very power that had caused it.\n\nWith a grunt of effort, Kaelen pushed himself up. His limbs felt heavy, as if his bones had been replaced with denser metal. He looked up at the towering silhouette of the High Spire, its peak lost in the gathering gloom of the upper atmosphere. The climb was miles of vertical rock and treacherous ledges, a journey that would challenge a man in peak condition. In his current state, it was a death sentence.\n\nHe gripped his forearm, feeling the new, unstable hum of the bound shard beneath his skin. The oath was changed. He was changed. \n\nHe took a single, staggering step toward the crater\u2019s edge. Then another. The ascent began not with a leap, but with the slow, agonizing scrape of a boot against the blackened glass. He had the shard. Now, he had to survive long enough to deliver it.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_kaelen\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"The Impact Crater (High Spire Valley)\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Kaelen successfully bound the volatile star-shard to his oath-mark through a violent metaphysical process.\",\n      \"The oath-mark has transitioned from solid black to a swirling pattern of midnight and white-hot veins.\",\n      \"Kaelen's shoulder wound has been cauterized by the energy of the binding, though he remains in a state of extreme physical exhaustion.\",\n      \"Kaelen has begun the treacherous climb out of the crater toward High Spire.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_oath_binding\",\n      \"THREAD_starfall_corruption\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",

Your writing is characterized by a tight, limited third-person perspective that never breaks into omniscient narration. You must maintain strict continuity, ensuring that characters utilize their full range of established skills and knowledge. Do not use 'As you know' dialogue or provide summaries of previous events. When a scene begins, drop the reader directly into the character's current sensory experience. Avoid clich\u00e9s in descriptions; instead of 'cold as ice,' describe the 'brittle, biting snap of air that makes the lungs ache.' Ensure all plot payoffs are seeded with subtle clues in earlier movements. Magic and high-fantasy elements must have clear costs and logical consistency.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\n",

Every step through the knee-deep peat required a deliberate shift of weight, a calculated gamble against the suction of the black mud. To rush was to sink; to hesitate was to let the stinging gnats find the gaps in the leather greaves.\n\nThe silver needle of the compass didn\u2019t spin; it shuddered, vibrating with a frequency that numbed the thumb pressing against the casing. This wasn't the erratic jitter of a magnetic anomaly, but the rhythmic, heavy thrum of a tethered ley-line. It pulled at the marrow, a dull ache in the long bones that signaled the proximity of a ruptured seal. The price of such proximity was always paid in blood-sugar and breath; the lungs felt scorched, as if the very oxygen had been thinned by the invisible pressure.\n\nA jagged obsidian shard protruded from a stump of petrified oak. It didn't just sit in the light; it seemed to drink it, casting a shadow that fell toward the sun rather than away. Touching it would be a mistake\u2014the last time a finger had brushed a similar fracture, the skin had turned the color of a bruised plum and stayed cold for a week. Instead, the focus remained on the tension of the wire stretched across the path, nearly invisible against the gray mist. It was set at mid-thigh height, weighted with a lead sinker to ensure it wouldn't flutter in the wind. A simple trap, but one that required a steady hand and a sharp eye to bypass without tripping the chime hidden in the hollow log nearby. The world didn't offer warnings, only consequences recorded in the stiffness of joints and the steady, rhythmic thud of a heart working too hard against a thinning atmosphere.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 5\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"outline\": {\n    \"path\": \"outline/outline.json\"\n  },\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_001/scene_005.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"DRAFTING\",\n  \"world\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_kaelen\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"The Impact Crater (High Spire Valley)\",\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_oath_binding\",\n      \"THREAD_starfall_corruption\"\n    ],\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Kaelen defended the shard against shadow-forms that emerged from the crater's edge.\",\n      \"The shadow-forms were dissipated by a violent burst of energy from Kaelen's oath-mark.\",\n      \"The remnants of the shadow-forms have been absorbed into the sky-glass of the crater, staining it black.\",\n      \"Kaelen has sustained serious physical injuries, including a scorched chest and a deep shoulder laceration.\",\n      \"The oath-mark has shifted from bruised purple to a deep, light-eating black.\"\n    ],\n    \"time\": {}\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n"
