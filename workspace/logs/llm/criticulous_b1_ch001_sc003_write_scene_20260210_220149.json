Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon hit the forest floor with a thud that vibrated through his very soul\u2014or whatever was left of it after the System finished digitizing his existence.\n\n[Location: Whispering Woods (Tutorial Zone)]\n[Environmental Status: Damp, Slightly Spooky, 100% Chance of Death]\n\n\"Welcome to the world of tomorrow, Artie! Try not to bleed on the grass; it\u2019s a nightmare to get out of the textures,\" Fizz chirped. \n\nShe was hovering a few feet above the moss, looking entirely too refreshed for someone who had just witnessed a man commit statistical suicide. She flipped through The Official System Guidebook, the pages crackling with a faint blue light.\n\nArtie groaned, pushing himself up. His palms came away smeared with green slime and dirt. He looked down at his Standard Issue Jumpsuit. It was a grey, mesh-like fabric that offered all the defensive properties of a wet paper towel. \n\n\"I feel... light,\" Artie muttered. \"And not the 'I lost ten pounds' light. More like the 'I am made of glass and hope' light.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s because you are,\" Fizz said, pointing a translucent finger at the air above his head. \"Check your HUD. I think the System is still trying to decide if you\u2019re a player or a very specific type of error message.\"\n\nArtie looked up. The floating red bar was there, mocking him.\n\n[HP: 1/1] (locked)\n\n\"One,\" Artie whispered. \"It really is just one.\"\n\n\"On the bright side, you don't have to worry about complicated math during combat,\" Fizz offered, her wings buzzing with manic energy. \"If a number bigger than zero touches you, you're a loot drop. It\u2019s very binary. Very elegant.\"\n\nA wet, squelching sound echoed through the clearing. It sounded like someone dropping a gallon of mayonnaise into a bathtub. Artie froze. To his left, a bush shuddered, and a translucent, lime-green blob wobbled into the light. It was about the size of a beach ball and looked suspiciously like it was made of industrial-strength dish soap.\n\n[Lesser Forest Slime - Lvl 1]\n[HP: 15/15]\n\n\"Oh, look! Your first tutorial mob,\" Fizz said, floating back to a safe distance. \"Usually, players use these to test their basic attacks and maybe take a few hits to see how their armor feels. You... well, you might want to skip the 'taking hits' part.\"\n\nThe slime didn't have eyes, but it definitely had intent. It vibrated, its entire body rippling with a rhythmic, hungry intensity. It began to slide across the moss toward Artie. It wasn't fast, but it was persistent.\n\n\"Okay,\" Artie said, backing away. \"It\u2019s a slime. I\u2019ve played games. You just... you hit it, right? I have 100% Crit Rate. I should be able to just poke it and it explodes.\"\n\n[Crit Rate: 100%] (locked)\n\n\"Theoretically, yes,\" Fizz called out. \"But remember, Artie, you have the Agility of a sedentary office chair. And that slime? It\u2019s Level 1, but it\u2019s still faster than a spreadsheet.\"\n\nArtie stepped back again, his heel catching on a gnarled root. He stumbled, his heart hammering against his ribs\u2014a frantic, 1-HP drumbeat. The slime surged forward, a glob of its acidic body stretching out like a questing tongue. It sizzled as it touched a patch of grass near Artie\u2019s foot, turning the green blades into a blackened, smoking slurry.\n\n[Warning: Corrosive Contact Detected]\n[Estimated Damage: 2-4 HP per second]\n\n\"Two to four?\" Artie\u2019s voice went up an octave. \"I only have one! That\u2019s a 400% overkill!\"\n\n\"The System loves a good rounding error,\" Fizz said, appearing to take notes in her manual.\n\nArtie scrambled backward, his hands searching for a weapon, a rock, a particularly sturdy stick\u2014anything. But the Whispering Woods were suspiciously clean of debris. The slime lunged again, a slow-motion leap that felt like a falling mountain of jelly. Artie twisted out of the way, the Standard Issue Jumpsuit brushing against a low-hanging branch.\n\n[Stamina: 95/100]\n\nHe was breathing hard now. Every movement felt heavy, every step a gamble. He could see the individual bubbles trapped inside the slime\u2019s body. It was close enough that he could smell it\u2014a cloying, chemical scent like an over-cleaned hospital hallway.\n\nHe backed up one more step and his shoulder blades hit something hard and unforgiving. He glanced back. A massive, ancient oak tree blocked his path. Its bark was rough and indifferent to his plight.\n\nHe was trapped.\n\nThe slime stopped its slide a few feet away. It began to compress itself, drawing its gelatinous mass inward like a coiled spring. It was preparing to launch.\n\n\"Fizz?\" Artie gulped.\n\n\"Yes, Artie?\"\n\n\"If I die in the tutorial, do I get a refund on my life?\"\n\n\"Checking...\" Fizz flipped a page. \"Nope. But you do get a very colorful 'Game Over' screen. I hear the music is quite catchy.\"\n\nThe slime vibrated one last time, a high-pitched hum that made Artie's teeth ache. He pressed his back against the tree, his eyes wide, realizing that in this world, 'Level 1' didn't mean 'Easy.' It meant 'Lethal.' \n\nThe slime launched.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"CHAR_FIZZ\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"Whispering Woods\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie arrived in the Whispering Woods tutorial zone.\",\n      \"Artie encountered a Level 1 Lesser Forest Slime.\",\n      \"Artie realized that even minimal environmental damage (2-4 HP) is fatal to his 1 HP build.\",\n      \"Artie is currently backed against a tree with the slime launching an attack.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie arrived in the Whispering Woods and immediately encountered a Level 1 Slime.

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nItem naming: use display_name for prose; use item_id only in JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\n\ufeffOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the

No recap.\n- Summaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\n- Use the continuity pack and state for continuity.\n- Use character_registry to keep names consistent in prose.\n- Timeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\n- State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\n- Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n- Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\n- Inventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- For held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\n- Continuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or '(locked)' only.\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\n- titles are arrays of objects with stable name fields; do not emit titles as plain strings.\n- If item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for ownership/custody labels in authoritative outputs.\n- Use item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\n- If a required event is not in the Scene Card, do not perform it.\n- Enforce scene-card durable constraints: honor `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, and `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\n- Respect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope` when proposing durable mutations; do not mutate physical custody in non-present/non-real scope unless explicitly marked override.\n- summary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\n- STATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\n- If state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\n- Return prose plus a state_patch JSON block.\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n- All *_updates arrays must contain objects; never emit bare strings as array entries.\n- character_updates.containers must be an array of objects with at least: container, owner, contents (array).\n- Durable-state mutation blocks are mandatory when applicable:\n- Required fields for durable registry entries (when creating NEW ids or filling missing required fields):\n  - item_registry_updates MUST be an array of objects.

I checked the floating red bar hovering above its translucent, jiggly head. \n\n[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 3] [HP: 45/45]\n\nForty-five health. At my current Strength of 12, with a base weapon damage of 4-6, I was looking at a nine-hit kill minimum, assuming the RNG gods didn't decide to spit on my shoes today. \n\n\"You know,\" I said, adjusting my grip on the rusted shortsword. \"In most worlds, puddles are for stepping in, not for getting dissolved by.\"\n\nThe slime responded by launching a glob of corrosive mucus. I rolled left, the grass staining my knees.\n\n[Stamina: 88/100]\n\n\"Missed me. Barely. That\u2019s a three-second cooldown on your spit, isn't it?\"\n\nI didn't wait for the confirmation. I lunged.

They taste like copper and bad decisions.\" \n\nI swung again, the numbers popping in the air like neon confetti. This wasn't just a fight; it was a grind.
