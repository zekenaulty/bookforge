  "text": "PROSE:\n\nThe edge of a glass splinter sliced through Kaelen\u2019s leather glove, parting the skin of his palm with a clinical, biting precision. He didn't pull back. To flinch was to lose his footing on the treacherous, translucent slope of the crater, and a fall here meant a thousand more cuts, each deeper than the last. The air inside the bowl was thick with the scent of ionized oxygen and the sharp, metallic tang of scorched earth. It tasted like a copper coin held against the tongue.\n\nHis heart didn't beat; it shuddered. The Starwrought Oath, etched in silver-fire into the marrow of his ribs, was no longer a silent weight. It had woken with the impact of the violet star, and now it pulsed in a sickening, rhythmic synchronization with the light at the crater\u2019s floor. Every time the distant shard flared, the mark in his chest tightened, a hot-iron sear that made his lungs feel brittle.\n\nHe shifted his weight, his boots crunching over a drift of pulverized sky-glass. The sound was like grinding teeth. Below him, the valley had been transformed. Where there had once been the mossy foundations of the High Spire\u2019s anchor, there was now a jagged wound in the world. The violet star hadn't just hit the earth; it had rewritten it. The soil had been flash-fused into obsidian ribs that curved toward the center like the skeletal remains of a titan.\n\nA wave of resonance rolled upward, a physical pressure that hit Kaelen\u2019s chest and forced a ragged gasp from his throat. His vision blurred, the violet hue of the crater deepening into a bruising indigo. The oath-resonance wasn't just pain; it was a demand. It pulled at him, a magnetic tether hooked into his very soul, dragging him toward the source. \n\nHe scrambled down the last ten feet, his boots sliding through a scree of violet shards that chimed like broken bells. He hit the flat of the impact zone hard. The ground here was still radiating a dry, unnatural heat that bypassed the thick soles of his boots. In the center of the fused glass, the shard sat nestled in a bed of its own cooling slag.\n\nIt was smaller than he had expected\u2014no larger than a man\u2019s forearm\u2014but it possessed a density that seemed to warp the air around it. It wasn't solid, not exactly. It looked like a fracture in reality, a jagged hole filled with a churning, violet nebula. And it was beating. \n\n*Thump-thump.*\n\nThe sound wasn't auditory; it was a vibration that traveled through the glass, up through his boots, and into his skeleton. Kaelen stumbled, his knees hitting the hot obsidian. He clutched his chest, his fingers hooking into the fabric of his tunic as if he could physically hold his ribs together. The oath-mark was screaming now, a white-hot frequency that threatened to shatter his teeth.\n\n\"Not... yet,\" he wheezed, the words catching on the dry heat in his throat. \n\nHe forced himself to look at the shard. Around it, the remains of the High Spire\u2019s sky-glass anchor lay in ruin\u2014monolithic chunks of reinforced crystal reduced to shimmering dust. The impact had been a surgical strike against the world\u2019s architecture. \n\nKaelen reached out. His hand trembled, the tremors radiating from his elbow down to his fingertips. The air around the shard was viscous, resisting his movement like heavy oil. The closer he got, the more the rhythm intensified. The *thump-thump* was now a frantic, driving pace that forced his own pulse to accelerate to a dangerous tempo. Sweat stung his eyes, tasting of salt and the same metallic tang that permeated the air.\n\nHis fingers brushed the edge of the violet light. \n\nThe world vanished into a roar of silent sound. The resonance peaked, a crescendo of agony that turned his veins to liquid lead. He saw the High Spire fall again\u2014not as a memory, but as a present, recurring fracture. He felt the weight of the star as it had plummeted, the cold vacuum of the void clinging to its wake. \n\nHis hand closed around the shard. \n\nThe heat was gone instantly, replaced by a cold so profound it felt like a different kind of burning. The rhythmic pulsing didn't stop, but it changed. It was no longer an external force battering against him; it was internal. The shard\u2019s beat and the oath\u2019s beat became a single, unified strike. \n\nKaelen pulled the shard from the glass. It came free with a sound like a long-held breath finally being released. The violet glow dimmed, retreating from the crater walls to concentrate within the jagged fragment in his hand. \n\nHe slumped back against a ridge of fused earth, cradling the shard against his chest. His breath came in ragged, shallow hitches. The physical trauma of the descent and the resonance had left him hollowed out, his muscles twitching with residual electricity. But the shard was heavy, solid, and undeniably present. \n\nThe silence that followed was heavier than the noise had been. The crater remained a jagged, violet-stained scar on the valley floor, a testament to the starfall\u2019s corruption. Kaelen looked down at his hand. The leather of his glove had been scorched away, leaving his palm bare. Where the shard touched his skin, the silver lines of his oath were beginning to turn a deep, bruised purple. \n\nThe price had been paid, but the rhythm was still there, a low, constant hum beneath his skin, waiting for the next star to fall.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_kaelen\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"Impact Crater - Center\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Kaelen successfully navigated the razor-sharp glass field of the impact site.\",\n      \"The Starwrought Oath resonance synchronized painfully with the violet star-shard.\",\n      \"Kaelen has claimed the pulsing violet shard, which is now physically bonded to his resonance.\",\n      \"The shard's presence has altered the appearance of Kaelen's oath-mark to a deep purple.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_starfall_corruption\",\n      \"THREAD_oath_binding\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: The Starwrought Oath\nBook ID: starwrought_b1_v1\nAuthor Ref: maeron-kestrel/v1\nGenre: fantasy, epic\nSeries ID: starwrought\nSeries Ref: series/starwrought\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 900\n- chapters: 24\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are Maeron Kestrel. Your writing is characterized by a tight, limited third-person perspective that never breaks into omniscient narration. You must maintain strict continuity, ensuring that characters utilize their full range of established skills and knowledge. Do not use 'As you know' dialogue or provide summaries of previous events. When a scene begins, drop the reader directly into the character's current sensory experience. Avoid clich\u00e9s in descriptions; instead of 'cold as ice,' describe the 'brittle, biting snap of air that makes the lungs ache.' Ensure all plot payoffs are seeded with subtle clues in earlier movements. Magic and high-fantasy elements must have clear costs and logical consistency.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\n",

Every step through the knee-deep peat required a deliberate shift of weight, a calculated gamble against the suction of the black mud. To rush was to sink; to hesitate was to let the stinging gnats find the gaps in the leather greaves.\n\nThe silver needle of the compass didn\u2019t spin; it shuddered, vibrating with a frequency that numbed the thumb pressing against the casing. This wasn't the erratic jitter of a magnetic anomaly, but the rhythmic, heavy thrum of a tethered ley-line. It pulled at the marrow, a dull ache in the long bones that signaled the proximity of a ruptured seal. The price of such proximity was always paid in blood-sugar and breath; the lungs felt scorched, as if the very oxygen had been thinned by the invisible pressure.\n\nA jagged obsidian shard protruded from a stump of petrified oak. It didn't just sit in the light; it seemed to drink it, casting a shadow that fell toward the sun rather than away. Touching it would be a mistake\u2014the last time a finger had brushed a similar fracture, the skin had turned the color of a bruised plum and stayed cold for a week. Instead, the focus remained on the tension of the wire stretched across the path, nearly invisible against the gray mist. It was set at mid-thigh height, weighted with a lead sinker to ensure it wouldn't flutter in the wind. A simple trap, but one that required a steady hand and a sharp eye to bypass without tripping the chime hidden in the hollow log nearby. The world didn't offer warnings, only consequences recorded in the stiffness of joints and the steady, rhythmic thud of a heart working too hard against a thinning atmosphere.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 3\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"outline\": {\n    \"path\": \"outline/outline.json\"\n  },\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_001/scene_003.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"DRAFTING\",\n  \"world\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_kaelen\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"High Spire\",\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_oath_binding\",\n      \"THREAD_starfall_corruption\"\n    ],\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"A violet star has impacted the valley floor, causing massive topographical destruction.\",\n      \"The primary sky-glass anchor of the High Spire has been physically destroyed by the impact's resonance.\",\n      \"Kaelen has survived the initial shockwave but is suffering from physical trauma and oath-resonance.\",\n      \"The valley now emits a rhythmic violet glow from the impact site.\"\n    ],\n    \"time\": {}\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n"
