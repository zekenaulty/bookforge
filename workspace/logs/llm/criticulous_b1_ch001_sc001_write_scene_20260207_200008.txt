PROSE:

The fluorescent lights of the St. Jude’s breakroom hummed at a frequency specifically designed to induce migraines in anyone with a soul. It was a flickering, sickly yellow glow that made the beige linoleum floor look like a petri dish. Arthur ‘Artie’ Penhaligon leaned his forehead against the cool, scratched glass of the "Snack-O-Matic 3000" and let out a sigh that felt like it carried the weight of his entire thirty-two years of mediocre existence.

"Come on, you mechanical extortionist," Artie muttered. "It’s been three minutes. Just give me the Zesty Zaps."

Behind the glass, the coiled metal arm held a bag of neon-orange corn chips in a death grip. The bag was dangling—teetering on the edge of the precipice—held aloft by nothing more than a half-inch of crinkled plastic and the machine’s sheer, unadulterated spite.

Artie checked his wrist. Not for the time—the hospital had taken his watch—but at the plastic Patient ID Bracelet that marked him as a resident of Room 402. It was a reminder that he was currently a captive audience for this tragedy.

"I’ve already lost my appendix, machine," Artie said, his voice dropping into the low, dangerous register he usually reserved for healers who stood in the fire during raid nights. "Don't make me lose my three dollars, too. That’s a 100% loss rate on my current liquid assets."

He tapped the glass. Nothing. He nudged the side of the machine with his hip, careful not to jostle the IV bruise on his arm. The bag of chips didn't even quiver. It was as if the laws of physics had decided to take a coffee break specifically to screw him over.

In Artie’s mind, a translucent red bar appeared over the machine. 

[Vending Machine - Lvl 1] [HP: 150/150]

He’d spent too many years staring at screens. Now, even in the "real world," he couldn't help but categorize his problems as encounters. The machine was a Tank. High defense, zero mobility, and currently holding his loot hostage.

"Right. Percussive maintenance it is," Artie whispered. 

He took a half-step back, his hospital gown fluttering open at the back in a way that was definitely a debuff to his Charisma stat. He ignored the draft. He had a goal. He had a hunger that only MSG and food coloring could satisfy.

He delivered a sharp, calculated kick to the base of the machine.

*Clang.*

The machine groaned. The coil turned a fraction of a millimeter. The bag of Zesty Zaps shifted, then settled back into its stubborn hang.

"Oh, you want to play dirty?" Artie’s eyes narrowed. "I see how it is. You’re a boss with a second phase."

He reached into the depths of his gown’s pocket—which was really just a hole in the seam—and realized he was out of quarters. He’d pumped three dollars’ worth of change into this thing, and it had given him nothing but a digital middle finger in the form of a 'Transaction Pending' message that refused to clear.

He looked around the breakroom. It was empty. The nurses were busy at the station down the hall, and the only other patient in the wing was a ninety-year-old man who thought Artie was his grandson, 'Little Timmy.'

Artie turned back to the machine. He could see the internal wiring through a gap where the plastic molding had come loose near the coin slot. A faint, ozone-heavy scent wafted from the gap. Most people would have seen a fire hazard. Artie saw a glitch in the armor.

"If I can just... jiggle the sensor..."

He reached out, his fingers hovering near the jagged edge of the coin return. He wasn't thinking about the fact that he was standing on a damp floor in thin socks. He wasn't thinking about the faulty wiring of a building that hadn't been renovated since the Nixon administration. He was thinking about the chips.

"Identify weakness," he muttered, a habit from his tabletop days.

He shoved his hand into the coin return slot, reaching upward toward the mechanism. His fingers brushed against something cold, metallic, and vibrating with an intensity that felt... wrong.

Then, the world changed.

A spark, bright as a dying star, jumped from the machine’s internal motherboard directly into Artie’s Patient ID Bracelet. The plastic didn't melt; it acted as a conduit. 

[Warning: Critical System Error Detected!]

The text didn't appear on a screen. It appeared in the air, burned into his retinas in a searing, neon violet.

"Wait, what?" Artie gasped, but the word was cut short as a surge of electricity slammed into his chest.

It didn't feel like a shock. It felt like a calculation. It felt like a million lines of code being written into his marrow at the speed of light. His heart, usually a reliable if somewhat sluggish organ, decided to attempt a 200-bpm sprint before hitting a brick wall.

[HP: 45/45]
[HP: 22/45]
[HP: 5/45]

Artie’s vision began to pixelate. The beige floor turned into a grid of shimmering white squares. The vending machine wasn't a machine anymore; it was a towering monolith of error messages and corrupted textures.

"I'm... dying... over... chips?" Artie thought, the snark surviving even as his nervous system began to fry. "That is... such a... garbage... drop..."

[HP: 1/45]

The world tilted. The hum of the fluorescent lights rose to a deafening roar, a digital scream that drowned out the sound of his own pulse. The Zesty Zaps finally fell, hitting the bottom of the tray with a plastic *thud* that Artie heard with impossible clarity.

[HP: 0/45]

[Status: Deceased]
[Processing Soul Data...]
[Error: Statistical Anomaly Detected!]
[Re-routing to System Initialization...]

The breakroom dissolved. The smell of ozone and hospital disinfectant vanished, replaced by a profound, echoing silence. Artie felt himself falling, not down, but *out*—out of the room, out of the hospital, out of the reality that had spent thirty-two years trying to bore him to death.

He drifted in a void of pure obsidian, punctuated by scrolling lines of code that moved too fast to read. 

"Well," Artie’s internal voice echoed in the darkness. "On the bright side, I don't have to worry about that hospital bill anymore."

A single, massive window materialized in front of him. It was sleek, blue, and pulsed with a soft, rhythmic light.

[Welcome, User: Arthur Penhaligon]
[You have died due to: Environmental Hazard (Vending Machine)]
[Calculating Compensation for 'Absurdity of Death'...]

"Absurdity of death?" Artie would have laughed if he had lungs. "Yeah, tell me about it. I hope there's a 'Dying for Snacks' achievement. Does it come with a title?"

[Compensation Calculated.]
[System initialization beginning in 3... 2... 1...]

The void exploded into light.
