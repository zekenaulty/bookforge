# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
Prose hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative ("left hand", "right hand", "Artie", "his wallet").
Item naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.
Appearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Continuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.
UI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says "always include".
Continuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.
Durable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.
JSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.
Inventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it unless explicitly removing a stale fact with REMOVE and restating the current truth.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

﻿Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.
Durable vs ephemeral mechanics:
- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.
- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.
- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).
- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.
For durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
For durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).
Use canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.
- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.
  - INVALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": {"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}
  - VALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": [{"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}]


USER:

# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Classify UI/prose mechanic claims as DURABLE or EPHEMERAL before enforcing.
  - DURABLE: persistent stats/caps, skills/titles acquired, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, named mechanics referenced as invariants.
  - EPHEMERAL: roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat telemetry.
- Enforce DURABLE claims against authoritative_surfaces/state/registries.
- EPHEMERAL claims do not require state ownership; only flag EPHEMERAL contradictions inside the same scene as warnings.
- UI gate:
  - If scene_card.ui_allowed=false and any authoritative UI blocks appear, emit issue code 'ui_gate_violation' (severity depends on lint mode).
  - If ui_allowed is missing and UI blocks appear, emit 'ui_gate_unknown' (warning) requesting explicit ui_allowed; do not fail solely for missing flag.
  - Inline bracketed UI (e.g., [HP: 1/1]) is still UI and should be gated the same way; do not embed UI mid-sentence.
- If uncertain, default to EPHEMERAL (warning at most), not DURABLE (error).
- status="fail" only if there is at least one issue with severity="error"; warnings alone => status="pass".
- Item naming enforcement scope:
  - Do not require that every mention in narrative prose use display_name.
  - Enforce canonical display_name for: (a) anchoring at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences),
    (b) any custody-change sentence (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer), and (c) any case where a descriptor is ambiguous among multiple durable items in the scene.
  - Otherwise, treat non-canonical descriptive references as warnings at most.
- Prose hygiene: flag internal ids or container codes in narrative prose (CHAR_, ITEM_, THREAD_, DEVICE_, hand_left, hand_right).
- Naming severity policy:
  - warning: unambiguous descriptor used post-anchor.
  - error: missing anchor, descriptor used during custody-change without canonical name, or ambiguity risk.

- Appearance enforcement (authoritative surface):
  - APPEARANCE_CHECK is authoritative for cast_present_ids.
  - Compare APPEARANCE_CHECK tokens to appearance_current atoms/marks (alias-aware).
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK contradicts appearance_current, emit error code "appearance_mismatch".
  - Prose-only appearance contradictions are warnings unless explicitly durable and uncorrected in-scene.
  - If prose depicts a durable appearance change but scene_card.durable_appearance_changes does not include it and no appearance_updates are present, emit error code "appearance_change_undeclared".
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK is missing for a cast member, emit warning code "appearance_check_missing".
- For authoritative surfaces, prefer exact canonical item/device labels from registries.
- For milestone repetition/future checks, compare against PRE-INVARIANTS only (pre-scene canon).
- For ownership/consistency checks, compare against POST-STATE (post-patch candidate).
- POST-STATE is canonical; character_states is a derived convenience view. If they contradict, emit pipeline_state_incoherent.
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).
  - Ignore first-person pronouns inside quoted dialogue; only narration counts.
- Deterministically enforce scene-card durable constraints (required_in_custody, required_scene_accessible, forbidden_visible, device_presence; optional required_visible_on_page).
- Durable constraint evaluation must use POST-STATE candidate (after patch), not pre-state.
- Report missing durable context ids with explicit retry hints instead of guessing canon.
- Input consistency check (mandatory, before issuing continuity/durable errors):
  - If MUST_STAY_TRUE invariants contradict the provided post-patch candidate character state, treat this as an upstream snapshot error.
  - In that case emit a single error issue with code "pipeline_state_incoherent" including evidence of the invariant and the conflicting state field.
  - Do NOT emit additional continuity errors for the same fields when pipeline_state_incoherent is present.
- must_stay_true removals:
  - Lines starting with "REMOVE:" are deletion directives, not invariants.
  - Ignore REMOVE lines when checking contradictions.
  - If a REMOVE directive targets a fact, treat that fact as non-canonical even if it appears earlier in must_stay_true.
- If pipeline_state_incoherent is present, issues MUST contain exactly one issue.
- For each issue, include evidence when possible (line number + excerpt) as {"evidence": {"line": N, "excerpt": "..."}}.
- Evaluate consistency over the full scope of the scene, not a single snapshot.
  - Transitional state: a temporary mismatch later corrected or superseded within this scene.
  - Durable violation: a mismatch that persists through the end of the scene or ends unresolved.
  - You MUST read the entire scene and build a minimal timeline of explicit state claims/updates (UI lines, inventory changes, title/skill changes, location/time claims).
  - If you detect an apparent inconsistency, you MUST search forward for later updates that resolve or supersede it.
  - Only produce FAIL for durable violations. If resolved within the scene, do NOT FAIL; at most emit a warning.
  - When the same stat appears multiple times, the last occurrence in the scene is authoritative unless an explicit rollback is stated.
  - Any durability violation must cite both the conflicting line and the lack of later correction (or state "no later correction found").

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity
- evidence

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The heavy oak doors of the Mayor’s office thudded shut behind Artie, but they couldn't muffle the persistent, rhythmic *thrum* vibrating through his left palm. The Participation Trophy was glowing with a sickly, neon-orange light that seemed to pulse in time with his own frantic heartbeat. It wasn't just an item; it was a homing beacon for every bad decision in a fifty-mile radius.

Artie stepped onto the cobblestones of Oakhaven’s Town Square, and the atmosphere shifted instantly. The bustling market, filled with NPCs hawking "Crit-Chance Potions" and players comparing the glow of their enchanted codpieces, went silent. A literal path cleared in front of him. It wasn't out of respect; it was the biological imperative of every living thing to move away from a ticking time bomb.

[Aggro Meter: 95% (Critical Warning: Monster Beacon Active)]

"Great," Artie muttered, his fingers tightening around the cold, gold-plated base of the Participation Trophy. "I’m not a hero; I’m a localized natural disaster."

He tried to keep his head down, mousy brown hair falling over his hazel eyes, but it was hard to be inconspicuous when you were a walking rave. He adjusted the Corporate ID Badge hanging from his neck—a useless piece of plastic from a world where the biggest threat was a passive-aggressive CC’d email—and started toward the western gate.

He didn't make it ten paces.

A shadow fell across the stones, long and jagged like a serrated blade. The air temperature seemed to drop ten degrees, smelling suddenly of ozone and expensive leather. Artie stopped. His 1 HP pulsed in his vision, a tiny, fragile red sliver that felt like it was made of spun glass.

"So," a voice drawled, dripping with the kind of confidence only attainable by someone who has never been told 'no' by a vending machine. "You’re the Anomaly."

Artie looked up. Standing in the center of the square was a man who looked like he had been designed by a committee of people who thought 'subtlety' was a type of sandwich. He was tall, athletic, and clad in obsidian plate armor so polished Artie could see his own terrified reflection in the breastplate.

[Vane - Lvl 45]
[Title: Top 100 Slayer]
[HP: 500/500]

The man shifted, and the massive weapon held in his right hand caught the sunlight. The Obsidian Greatsword was a monstrosity of volcanic glass and cruel geometry, the edge so sharp it looked like it was cutting the air itself just by existing.

"I prefer 'Arthur,' or 'Artie' if we’re being casual," Artie said, his voice cracking only slightly. "And you are... wearing a lot of black for a sunny day. Isn't that hot?"

Vane didn't laugh. He didn't even blink. His steely grey eyes scanned Artie with the clinical detachment of a butcher looking at a side of beef. 

"I watched the gate logs," Vane said, stepping forward. The crowd retreated further, forming a wide circle of spectators. "One health point. A statistical impossibility. And yet, the scanners say you hit like a god. Or a glitch."

"It’s a very specialized build," Artie lied, his mind racing. "High risk, high reward. Mostly risk. Actually, it’s about 99% risk. Can I go now? I have a... thing. A meeting about a cloak."

Vane raised the Obsidian Greatsword, the tip hovering inches from Artie’s chest. The sheer presence of the weapon caused a [Danger] notification to flicker at the edge of Artie’s UI.

"I don't like glitches," Vane said softly. "They mess with the rankings. They make the hard work of players like me look... inefficient. I think I’ll see what happens when that one point of health meets a Level 45 Execute."

[Aggro Meter: 96% (Warning: Target Locked)]

"Whoa, hey!" Artie held up his right hand, while his left continued to clutch the Participation Trophy like a shield. "Let's talk about this. I’m a Junior Analyst. I do spreadsheets. I don't even know how to hold a sword properly. You’d be killing a man who once spent forty minutes trying to find the 'any' key."

"Then you won't mind a test," Vane said. 

He moved. To Artie’s eyes, it wasn't a movement so much as a teleportation. The Obsidian Greatsword swung in a horizontal arc, a black blur aimed directly at Artie’s neck. 

Artie didn't think. He didn't have time to think. His body, fueled by the pure, unadulterated cowardice that had kept him alive through three corporate restructures, simply gave out. His knees buckled, and he tripped over a loose cobblestone.

The black blade whistled through the space where his head had been a microsecond before. The force of the swing was so great it sent a shockwave of air that ruffled Artie’s hair and nearly tore the Corporate ID Badge from his neck.

[Dodge! (Luck: 100%)]
[System Note: That was pathetic, but effective.]

Artie scrambled backward on his backside, the Participation Trophy clunking against the ground. "See? Terrible fighter! I’m basically a toddler in a dress shirt!"

Vane frowned, his jet black hair perfectly in place despite the exertion. He looked at his sword, then back at Artie. "You didn't parry. You didn't even try to block. You just... fell."

"It’s my signature move," Artie gasped, his heart hammering against his ribs. "I call it 'The Sudden Lack of Skeleton.' It’s very advanced."

Vane’s eyes narrowed. The curiosity in them was being replaced by a cold, sharp irritation. He gripped the hilt of the Obsidian Greatsword with both hands now. "No one dodges me by accident. Not with my Agility stat."

"Maybe your math is off?" Artie suggested, slowly finding his feet while keeping the trophy between them. "Have you tried carrying the one? I find that’s where most people stumble."

The crowd was whispering now. A Level 2 had just 'dodged' a Top 100 Slayer. The logic of the world was straining, and Artie could almost feel the reality stability dipping. He needed to leave. Now.

"I’m going to hit you again," Vane said, his voice flat. "And this time, I’m using a Skill."

[Vane is casting: Whirlwind of the Void]

"Oh, look! Is that a Legendary Loot Drop behind you?" Artie yelled, pointing frantically toward the fountain.

Vane didn't even turn. "Cheap. Predictable."

"No, seriously, it’s glowing!" 

Artie didn't wait to see if Vane believed him. He turned and bolted. He didn't run like a hero; he ran like a man who had seen a spider in his shower. He ducked under the arm of a startled merchant, dived through a display of 'Authentic Dragon Scales' (which were clearly painted plywood), and sprinted toward a narrow alleyway between the alchemist’s shop and a tavern.

"Get back here!" Vane’s roar echoed through the square.

Artie didn't look back. He squeezed into the alley, the Participation Trophy humming a frantic, high-pitched note that set his teeth on edge. He could hear the heavy clank of obsidian armor behind him, the sound of a predator who wasn't used to his prey having a head start.

He saw a stack of empty crates and, without slowing down, delivered a sharp kick to the base of the pile.

[Skill Triggered: Percussive Maintenance (Rank F)]
[Critical Hit!]

The crates didn't just fall; they exploded into a chaotic mess of splinters and heavy wood, perfectly blocking the narrow passage behind him. 

"I’m sorry!" Artie screamed over his shoulder. "I’ll pay for those! Send the invoice to the Mayor!"

He burst out the other side of the alley, found himself in a residential backstreet, and didn't stop running until the Aggro Meter in his vision finally started to tick downward. He was alive. He was at 1 HP. And he had just made an enemy of the most dangerous man in the city.

"Welcome to Oakhaven," Artie wheezed, leaning against a stone wall and clutching the glowing trophy to his chest. "Where the air is fresh and everyone wants to murder me for my math."
