Artie stood at the epicenter of a hundred-yard trench, a perfectly straight scar of blackened earth that had replaced a significant portion of the Whispering Woods. His finger hovered over a glowing blue icon vibrating in the air.\n\n[Stat Points Available: 5]\n[Skill Points Available: 1]\n\n\"He needed to put these into something before a squirrel breathed on him,\" Artie muttered. His heart was hammering against his ribs, a reminder that his lanky frame was currently held together by exactly one hit point. One. A stiff breeze was a boss mechanic.\n\n\"Ooh, look at you! Level two and already a domestic terrorist,\" Fizz chirped, her neon pink hair leaving trails of digital sparks as she zipped around his head. Fizz reached into her satchel and pulled out the heavy, leather-bound volume of The Noob's Guide to Not Dying. \"The Guide says level two is when most players find their first pair of pants. You, however, seem to have found a way to violate the Geneva Convention.\"\n\n\"It was an accident, Fizz. The math glitched.\"\n\n\"The System doesn't call it a glitch, Artie. It calls it 'Optimization'.\"\n\n[System Notification: Optimization Complete]\n[Map Sector 4-B has been cleared of redundant biological assets. Calculation time: 0.0004s]\n[Performance Review: S-Rank (Efficiency)]\n\n\"Redundant biological assets?\" Artie looked at the smoldering remains of what used to be a very pretty grove of trees. \"You mean the forest? And the slime?\"\n\n\"And probably a few very confused dryads,\" Fizz added, flipping through The Noob's Guide to Not Dying. \"But hey, the System appreciates the hustle. Look, it\u2019s giving you a prize!\"\n\nA chime, bright and mocking, echoed through the clearing. A heavy, gold-painted Participation Trophy materialized directly into his right hand. \n\n[Reward Issued: Participation Trophy]\n\nArtie looked down. The Participation Trophy was a gaudy, gold-plated statue of a slime with a confused expression, mounted on a faux-marble base. A small brass plaque on the front read: I Survived the Math.\n\n\"A participation trophy?\" Artie lifted the heavy Participation Trophy. It felt like it weighed ten pounds. \"I vaporized a hundred yards of reality and I get a 'You Tried' sticker?\"\n\n\"Read the fine print, Artie. In this game, 'Participation' is a threat.\"\n\n[Item: Participation Trophy (Cursed)]\n[Type: Accessory / Monster Lure]\n[Description: Awarded to entities whose presence is statistically negligible but physically disruptive. You\u2019re not a hero, but you sure are loud.]\n[Effect: 'The Center of Attention' - Increases monster aggro radius by 400%. All nearby entities are now aware of your exact coordinates and your lack of defensive stats.]\n\nA low, guttural growl vibrated through the air, coming from the un-scorched edge of the woods. Then another. And a chittering sound that sounded like a thousand teeth grinding together.\n\n\"Fizz,\" Artie said, his voice dropping an octave. \"What is that?\"\n\n\"That would be the 'Center of Attention' effect kicking in,\" she said, her glowing violet eyes wide as she checked a new UI element appearing in his vision.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 15% - Mildly Interesting]\n\n\"I need to spend these points. Now.\" Artie stabbed his finger at the 'Agility' button on the floating menu. If he couldn't have health, he needed speed. \n\n[Warning: Stat allocation interrupted by environmental threat.]\n\n\"What? No! Confirm! Confirm Agility!\"\n\n[Aggro Meter: 42% - Socially Significant]\n\n\"Artie, the Guide has a section on this!\" Fizz shouted, hovering over his shoulder. \"Chapter 4, Section 2: 'If you find yourself the target of an entire ecosystem, try to blend in.' Do you have any camouflage? Maybe you can pretend to be a very lanky, very terrified tree?\"\n\n\"I am holding a glowing gold trophy that literally screams 'Kill Me' to everything with a pulse!\" Artie yelled, swiping frantically at the menu. The 'Confirm' button kept sliding away every time the ground shook.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 78% - Local Celebrity]\n\nThe bushes at the edge of the trench exploded. Three Level 4 Dire Wolves, their fur matted with burrs and their eyes glowing with a predatory red light, skidded onto the blackened earth. Behind them, a swarm of Level 3 Needle-Wasps began to pour out of the canopy like a funnel cloud of hate.\n\n\"Fizz, the book! Give me something useful!\"\n\n\"Uh, let's see... 'If surrounded by apex predators, remember that you are also made of meat, which is a valuable resource'\u2014no, that\u2019s the Chef\u2019s Guide\u2014here!

The shadows of the trees were moving. A lot of shadows.\n\nArtie didn't wait for the wolves to charge. He tucked the Participation Trophy under his arm like a football and bolted down the center of the trench. It was the only clear path\u2014a straight shot toward what he hoped was the exit of this nightmare tutorial zone.\n\n\"Run, Artie! The Guide says the wolves have a pounce range of six meters!\" Fizz screamed, flying alongside him. \"Also, you're breathing wrong! The Guide recommends rhythmic diaphragmatic breathing for optimal flight-from-death!\"\n\n\"I'll breathe... when I'm... not... a snack!\" Artie wheezed. \n\nBehind him, the howling intensified. The sound of paws thundering on the vitrified soil was getting louder. He risked a glance over his shoulder and saw the lead wolf's jaws snapping inches from where his heels had been a second ago.\n\n[Stamina: 25/100]\n[Aggro Meter: MAX]\n\n\"The exit!\" Fizz pointed toward a break in the trees where the trench ended and a faint stone path began. \"Just reach the path! Monsters usually respect regional boundaries for some reason!\"\n\n\"I hope... they read... the same... manual!\"\n\nArtie pushed his legs harder, his lanky frame straining as the swarm of Needle-Wasps began to dive-bomb his head. He swung the Participation Trophy blindly behind me, the gold-plated slime clunking against something hard and chitinous.\n\n[Critical Hit! -12 HP (Needle-Wasp)]\n[Note: That was lucky. Don't do it again.]\n\n\"I'm trying!\" Artie yelled, the exit of the Whispering Woods looming ahead of him as a tide of fur and stingers surged at his back.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"CHAR_FIZZ\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"Whispering Woods (Optimized)\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie received the cursed Participation Trophy as a reward for vaporizing the forest.\",\n      \"The trophy's 'Center of Attention' effect drew a mob of monsters to Artie's location.\",\n      \"Artie attempted to allocate his stat points but was interrupted by the rising Aggro Meter.\",\n      \"Artie fled the Whispering Woods with a pack of Dire Wolves and Needle-Wasps in pursuit.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\",\n      \"THREAD_SYSTEM_GLITCH\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie received a cursed Participation Trophy that acted as a monster lure.\",\n      \"Forced to flee a growing mob of predators, he ran for the tutorial zone's exit while Fizz provided unhelpful advice from her guidebook.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Artie received the cursed Participation Trophy as a reward for vaporizing the forest.\",\n      \"The trophy's 'Center of Attention' effect drew a mob of monsters to Artie's location.\",\n      \"Artie attempted to allocate his stat points but was interrupted by the rising Aggro Meter.\",\n      \"Artie fled the Whispering Woods with a pack of Dire Wolves and Needle-Wasps in pursuit.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"REMOVE: inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> crumpled dollar bill (status=carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"REMOVE: inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> cracked smartphone (status=stowed, container=pocket_right)\",\n      \"REMOVE: inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> leather wallet (status=stowed, container=pocket_left)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Participation Trophy (held, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"milestone: artie_death = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: crit_glitch_reveal = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: build_finalized = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: slime_defeated = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: first_level_up = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: participation_trophy_acquired = DONE\",\n      \"Artie's HP is 1 and he is locked into the Crit-Only build.\",\n      \"A hundred-yard trench of vaporized forest exists in the Whispering Woods.\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Artie received a cursed Participation Trophy that increased his aggro radius by 400%.\",\n      \"A mob of Dire Wolves and Needle-Wasps chased Artie out of the Whispering Woods.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\n          \"item\": \"ITEM_participation_trophy\",\n          \"container\": \"hand_right\",\n          \"status\": \"held\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\n          \"container\": \"pocket_right\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n          \"contents\": []\n        },\n        {\n          \"container\": \"pocket_left\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n          \"contents\": []\n        }\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie is now a fugitive from an entire ecosystem due to his disruptive presence.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_FIZZ\",\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\n          \"item\": \"ITEM_guidebook\",\n          \"container\": \"hand_right\",\n          \"status\": \"held\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"item\": \"ITEM_fizz_wand\",\n          \"container\": \"belt\",\n          \"status\": \"stowed\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\n          \"container\": \"satchel\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_FIZZ\",\n          \"contents\": []\n        },\n        {\n          \"container\": \"belt\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_FIZZ\",\n          \"contents\": [\n            \"ITEM_fizz_wand\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"character_continuity_system_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"set\": {\n        \"stats\": {\n          \"hp\": {\n            \"current\": 1,\n            \"max\": 1\n          },\n          \"level\": 2,\n          \"stat_points\": 5,\n          \"skill_points\": 1\n        },\n        \"resources\": {\n          \"stamina\": 25\n        }\n      },\n      \"reason\": \"Stamina depleted during flight;

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\n\ufeffOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\":

        "content": "# REPAIR\n\nFix the scene based on lint issues.\nSummaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\nTimeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: pre-scene invariants and summary facts are binding unless the Scene Card depicts a change. If this scene changes a durable fact, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value and remove the old entry.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n- must_stay_true removal (mandatory when a durable fact is superseded):\n  - Add \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" in summary_update.must_stay_true.\n  - Place REMOVE lines before the new final invariant.\n  - REMOVE lines also apply to key_facts_ring (purge stale facts from continuity).\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\nFor held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\nContinuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.\n- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.\n- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.\n- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or '(locked)' only.\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nCanonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\nIf item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for authoritative labels and custody terms.\nUse item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If a durable appearance change occurs in this scene, record it in character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- APPEARANCE_CHECK is required in COMPLIANCE for each cast_present_id (4-8 tokens from atoms/marks).\n\nNaming repairs:\n- If lint flags an item naming issue, fix it with minimal edits.\n- Do not remove humor; simply anchor the item (add display_name near first mention) and ensure custody-change sentences include the display_name.\n- Do not rename item_id or registry fields; only adjust prose wording.\nsummary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\nSTATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nmust_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nIf state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nEnforce scene-card durable constraints: `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\nRespect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`.\n- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):\n  - If timeline_scope != \"present\" OR ontological_scope != \"real\", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).\n  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.\n  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category=\"timeline_override\".\nReturn corrected prose plus a corrected state_patch JSON block.\n\nOutput format (required, no code fences, no commentary):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n\nAPPEARANCE_CHECK:\n- CHAR_ID: <4-8 tokens from atoms/marks>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects.

Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n- Transfer vs registry conflict rule (must follow):\n  - If you create a NEW item in item_registry_updates with final custodian already set (e.g., CHAR_ARTIE), DO NOT emit transfer_updates for that item.\n  - If you emit transfer_updates for a NEW item, the registry entry must start with custodian=\"world\" and then transfer to the character.\n  - expected_before must match the registry entry at the moment of transfer (after any registry update that applies before it).  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects;

I stood at the epicenter of a hundred-yard trench, a perfectly straight scar of blackened earth that had replaced a significant portion of the Whispering Woods. My finger hovered over a glowing blue icon vibrating in the air.\n\n[Level Up! You are now Level 2]\n[Stat Points Available: 5]\n[Skill Points Available: 1]\n\n\"I need to put these into something before a squirrel breathes on me,\" I muttered. My heart was hammering against my ribs, a reminder that my lanky frame was currently held together by exactly one hit point. One. A stiff breeze was a boss mechanic.\n\n\"Ooh, look at you! Level two and already a domestic terrorist,\" Fizz chirped, her neon pink hair leaving trails of digital sparks as she zipped around my head. She reached into her satchel and pulled out a heavy, leather-bound volume. \"The Guide says level two is when most players find their first pair of pants. You, however, seem to have found a way to violate the Geneva Convention.\"\n\n\"It was an accident, Fizz. The math glitched.\"\n\n\"The System doesn't call it a glitch, Artie. It calls it 'Optimization'.\"\n\n[System Notification: Optimization Complete]\n[Map Sector 4-B has been cleared of redundant biological assets. Calculation time: 0.0004s]\n[Performance Review: S-Rank (Efficiency)]\n\n\"Redundant biological assets?\" I looked at the smoldering remains of what used to be a very pretty grove of trees. \"You mean the forest? And the slime?\"\n\n\"And probably a few very confused dryads,\" Fizz added, flipping through The Noob's Guide to Not Dying. \"But hey, the System appreciates the hustle. Look, it\u2019s giving you a prize!\"\n\nA chime, bright and mocking, echoed through the clearing. A heavy, gold-painted object materialized directly into my right hand. \n\n[Reward Issued: Participation Trophy]\n\nI looked down. The Participation Trophy was a gaudy, gold-plated statue of a slime with a confused expression, mounted on a faux-marble base. A small brass plaque on the front read: *I Survived the Math.*\n\n\"A participation trophy?\" I lifted the heavy thing. It felt like it weighed ten pounds. \"I vaporized a hundred yards of reality and I get a 'You Tried' sticker?\"\n\n\"Read the fine print, Artie. In this game, 'Participation' is a threat.\"\n\n[Item: Participation Trophy (Cursed)]\n[Type: Accessory / Monster Lure]\n[Description: Awarded to entities whose presence is statistically negligible but physically disruptive. You\u2019re not a hero, but you sure are loud.]\n[Effect: 'The Center of Attention' - Increases monster aggro radius by 400%. All nearby entities are now aware of your exact coordinates and your lack of defensive stats.]\n\nA low, guttural growl vibrated through the air, coming from the un-scorched edge of the woods. Then another. And a chittering sound that sounded like a thousand teeth grinding together.\n\n\"Fizz,\" I said, my voice dropping an octave. \"What is that?\"\n\n\"That would be the 'Center of Attention' effect kicking in,\" she said, her glowing violet eyes wide as she checked a new UI element appearing in my vision.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 15% - Mildly Interesting]\n\n\"I need to spend these points. Now.\" I stabbed my finger at the 'Agility' button on the floating menu. If I couldn't have health, I needed speed. \n\n[Warning: Stat allocation interrupted by environmental threat.]\n\n\"What? No! Confirm! Confirm Agility!\"\n\n[Aggro Meter: 42% - Socially Significant]\n\n\"Artie, the Guide has a section on this!\" Fizz shouted, hovering over my shoulder. \"Chapter 4, Section 2: 'If you find yourself the target of an entire ecosystem, try to blend in.' Do you have any camouflage? Maybe you can pretend to be a very lanky, very terrified tree?\"\n\n\"I am holding a glowing gold trophy that literally screams 'Kill Me' to everything with a pulse!\" I yelled, swiping frantically at the menu. The 'Confirm' button kept sliding away every time the ground shook.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 78% - Local Celebrity]\n\nThe bushes at the edge of the trench exploded. Three Level 4 Dire Wolves, their fur matted with burrs and their eyes glowing with a predatory red light, skidded onto the blackened earth. Behind them, a swarm of Level 3 Needle-Wasps began to pour out of the canopy like a funnel cloud of hate.\n\n\"Fizz, the book! Give me something useful!\"\n\n\"Uh, let's see... 'If surrounded by apex predators, remember that you are also made of meat, which is a valuable resource'\u2014no, that\u2019s the Chef\u2019s Guide\u2014here! 'Chapter 12: Running is a valid tactical choice for those who enjoy living.'\"\n\n[Aggro Meter: 99% - Trending Topic]\n\n[System Notification: Combat State Re-Initialized]\n[Current HP: 1/1]\n[Warning: You are currently being targeted by 14 unique entities.]\n\n\"Fourteen?\" I looked behind the wolves. The shadows of the trees were moving. A lot of shadows.\n\nI didn't wait for the wolves to charge. I tucked the Participation Trophy under my arm like a football and bolted down the center of the trench. It was the only clear path\u2014a straight shot toward what I hoped was the exit of this nightmare tutorial zone.\n\n\"Run, Artie! The Guide says the wolves have a pounce range of six meters!\" Fizz screamed, flying alongside me. \"Also, you're breathing wrong! The Guide recommends rhythmic diaphragmatic breathing for optimal flight-from-death!\"\n\n\"I'll breathe... when I'm... not... a snack!\" I wheezed. \n\nBehind me, the howling intensified. The sound of paws thundering on the vitrified soil was getting louder. I risked a glance over my shoulder and saw the lead wolf's jaws snapping inches from where my heels had been a second ago.\n\n[Stamina: 45/100]\n[Aggro Meter: MAX]\n\n\"The exit!\" Fizz pointed toward a break in the trees where the trench ended and a faint stone path began. \"Just reach the path! Monsters usually respect regional boundaries for some reason!\"\n\n\"I hope... they read... the same... manual!\"\n\nI pushed my legs harder, my lanky frame straining as the swarm of Needle-Wasps began to dive-bomb my head. I swung the Participation Trophy blindly behind me, the gold-plated slime clunking against something hard and chitinous.\n\n[Critical Hit! -12 HP (Needle-Wasp)]\n[Note: That was lucky. Don't do it again.]\n\n\"I'm trying!\" I yelled, the exit of the Whispering Woods looming ahead of me as a tide of fur and stingers surged at my back.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n
