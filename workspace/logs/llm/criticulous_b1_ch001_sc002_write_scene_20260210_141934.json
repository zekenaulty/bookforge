It was a phantom sensation, a lingering memory of the office breakroom where he\u2019d just been vaporized by a snack machine. He looked down at his hands. They were translucent, shimmering with a faint blue light, and\u2014most distressingly\u2014they were no longer holding his wallet.\n\n\"Oh, stop looking for your punch card, Arthur. You\u2019ve been promoted to the great beyond. Or demoted. It depends on how you feel about manual labor and frequent dismemberment.\"\n\nArtie spun around, his feet sliding on the non-existent floor. A woman\u2014no, a sprite? A pixie? A very caffeinated intern with wings?\u2014was hovering three feet off the ground. She wore a sharp, pinstriped vest over a neon-yellow blouse, and her hair was a chaotic puff of violet static. She was currently flipping through a thick, glowing book that looked like it had been bound in dragon hide and corporate red tape.\n\n[Name: Fizz]\n[Role: System Guide (Level 742)]\n[Current Mood: Professionally Impatient]\n\n\"Who are you?\" Artie asked, his voice sounding weirdly echoed, like he was talking inside a giant porcelain bowl. \"And where is my tie? That was a silk blend.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m Fizz. I\u2019m your assigned transition specialist,\" she said, not looking up from her book. She tapped a finger against a page, and a spark of light drifted out. \"And your tie, along with your leather wallet and that pocketful of sticky nickels, has been converted into raw data. You\u2019re currently a Level 0 'Nothing.' We need to fix that before the System\u2019s garbage collector decides you\u2019re an orphan process and deletes you.\"\n\nShe snapped the book shut\u2014the cover clearly read *System Manual: So You\u2019ve Died to an Appliance*\u2014and waved a hand in front of Artie\u2019s face.\n\n[ITEM_FIZZ_GUIDE: System Manual]\n\nA massive, semi-transparent blue screen flickered into existence between them. It looked like a character creation menu from a mid-2000s RPG, complete with low-resolution buttons and a font that was slightly too small to read comfortably.\n\n[Welcome to Character Creation, User #8,421,902]\n[Class: Office Drone (Lvl 1) - Initialized]\n[Base HP: 10/10]\n[Stat Points Available: 50]\n\n\"Office Drone?\" Artie squinted at the screen. \"That\u2019s my class? I spent eight years in middle management. I have a degree in Logistics!\"\n\n\"And the System has a degree in reality,\" Fizz countered, finally making eye contact. Her eyes were literal spinning gears. \"You died because you lost a fight to a vending machine, Arthur. 'Office Drone' is actually a generous assessment. Most people with your physical stats start as 'Unfortunate Bystander' or 'Lootable Corpse.'\"\n\nShe tapped the screen, highlighting the 'Stat Points' section. \n\n\"Look, we don't have all day. The Character Creation Void has a high overhead cost, and the Admin is a stickler for server efficiency. You\u2019ve got fifty points. Put them into Strength so you can carry a sword, or Agility so you can run away. Just do it quickly.\"\n\nArtie reached out, his finger hovering over the floating UI. \"What\u2019s 'Vitality' do?\"\n\n\"It increases your Health Points,\" Fizz said, yawning. \"Standard stuff. One point of Vitality usually equals ten HP. Since you\u2019re currently sitting at a pathetic ten HP, I\u2019d suggest dumping at least half of your points there. Unless you want the first breeze in the tutorial zone to fold you like a cheap card table.\"\n\nArtie looked at the Vitality bar. He tried to tap the '+' button, but as his finger drew near, the screen flickered. A line of red text scrolled across the bottom of the menu.\n\n[Warning: Latency Spike Detected in Sector 7-G]\n[Warning: UI Scaling Error - Please Contact Support]\n\n\"The screen is shaking,\" Artie noted, his finger trembling. \n\n\"It\u2019s fine,\" Fizz said, checking her nails. \"The System is just undergoing a minor 'Stability Optimization.' It happens whenever someone with a particularly boring soul enters the queue. It\u2019s like the universe is trying to fall asleep while processing you.\"\n\nArtie gritted his teeth. \"I\u2019m not boring. I\u2019m... consistent.\"\n\nHe tried to press the Vitality button again. The UI lurched. The entire menu shifted three inches to the left just as his finger made contact. Instead of 'Vitality,' his finger landed on a stat labeled 'Criticality (Experimental).'\n\n[Stat Point Allocated: Criticality +1]\n[Critical Hit Rate: 2.1%]\n\n\"Wait, no,\" Artie said, trying to pull back. \"I didn't mean to\u2014\"\n\nThe screen didn't just flicker this time; it strobed. The blue light turned a violent shade of magenta. A loud, grinding sound filled the void, like a thousand hard drives dying at once.\n\n\"Arthur, what are you doing?\" Fizz asked, her professional mask slipping into genuine alarm. \"The 'Criticality' stat is for high-level rogues and gamblers! It\u2019s not even supposed to be unlocked for 'Office Drones'!\"\n\n\"I\u2019m trying to cancel it!\" Artie yelled. He went to tap the 'Reset' button, but the UI was now a chaotic mess of overlapping windows and error messages. \n\n[Error: Recursive Stat Loop Detected]\n[Error: User Input Overflow]\n\nEvery time Artie tried to close a window, his finger seemed to register dozens of clicks on the 'Criticality' bar. The numbers were spinning like a slot machine gone rogue.\n\n[Criticality: 10...]\n[Criticality: 25...]\n[Criticality: 40...]\n\n\"Stop! You\u2019re dumping everything into one bucket!\" Fizz lunged forward, trying to grab his hand, but her fingers passed right through him. \"You\u2019re a ghost, Arthur! I can\u2019t stop you if you\u2019re the one authorized to click!\"\n\n\"I\u2019m not clicking! It\u2019s clicking itself!\"\n\nThe 'Stat Points Available' counter was plummeting. \n\n[Stat Points Available: 5]\n[Stat Points Available: 0]\n\nThe void fell silent. The magenta light faded back into a dull, pulsing blue. The UI stabilized, showing a single, final confirmation window.\n\n[System Notification: Stat Allocation Confirmed!]\n[Processing Balance Penalties...]\n[Processing Anomaly Compensation...]\n\n\"Oh, you\u2019ve done it now,\" Fizz whispered, staring at the screen with wide, gear-filled eyes. \"I\u2019ve seen some bad builds in my time\u2014I once guided a guy who put all his points into 'Digestive Efficiency'\u2014but this? This is a statistical crime.\"\n\nArtie looked at his new profile. His heart\u2014or the digital approximation of it\u2014sank into his stomach.\n\n[Name: Arthur Penhaligon]\n[Class: Office Drone (Lvl 1)]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Critical Hit Rate: 100%]\n[Stat Points: 0]\n\n\"One HP?\" Artie\u2019s voice cracked. \"I have one hit point? I had ten before I started! How did I lose health by leveling up?\"\n\n\"The System had to balance the math, Arthur,\" Fizz said, her voice dripping with a mix of pity and morbid fascination. She opened her manual and began flipping pages at a blur. \"Here it is. 'Law of Extreme Variables.' By pushing your Critical Hit rate to the absolute ceiling of one hundred percent, you\u2019ve effectively opted into the 'Perfect Glass' sub-clause. You can\u2019t fail to hit a vital spot, but in exchange, the System considers your existence to be... fragile. If anything touches you\u2014a bee, a falling leaf, a particularly aggressive sneeze\u2014you\u2019re dead. Again.\"\n\nArtie stared at the '1/1' on his health bar. It was a tiny, pathetic sliver of red. \n\n\"But I have a hundred percent crit rate,\" he said, trying to find the silver lining. \"That means I\u2019m powerful, right?\"\n\n\"It means you\u2019re a glitch with a heartbeat,\" Fizz corrected. \n\n[Title Gained: The Glassest Cannon]\n[Description: You are the ultimate 'High Risk, No Reward' build. You hit like a god and break like a teacup. Good luck. You\u2019re going to need it.]\n\n\"Can I change it?\" Artie asked, his finger hovering over the screen, hoping for a 'Back' button.\n\n\"Nope. Allocation is locked,\" Fizz said, snapping her book shut with a final, echoing thud. \"The data is written. You\u2019re officially the most dangerous and most pathetic entity in the tutorial zone.\"\n\n[System Notification: Character Creation Complete.]\n[Preparing for Deployment...]\n\nArtie looked at his hands again. They were no longer translucent; they were solid, clad in a simple, grey-mesh jumpsuit that offered zero protection. He felt a strange, humming energy vibrating in his palms\u2014the weight of a hundred percent certainty.\n\n\"What happens now?\" he asked.\n\n\"Now,\" Fizz said, a small, wicked grin appearing on her face as she vanished into a cloud of sparkling dust. \"We see if you can survive long enough to finish the opening cinematic.\"\n\nThe white void began to dissolve into pixels, the floor dropping away as the sounds of a distant, rustling forest began to bleed into the silence. Artie stood there, clutching his own chest, terrified that even his heartbeat might be too much for his 1 HP to handle.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present_ids\": [\"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"CHAR_FIZZ\"],\n    \"location\": \"Character Creation Void\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie met Fizz, his System Guide.\",\n      \"Artie interacted with a glitchy character creation UI.\",\n      \"Artie accidentally allocated all 50 stat points into Criticality.\",\n      \"Artie's HP was reduced to 1 as a balance penalty for his 100% Crit rate.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"]\n  },\n  \"character_continuity_system_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"set\": {\n        \"stats\": {\n          \"hp\": {\n            \"current\": 1,\n            \"max\": 1\n          },\n          \"crit_rate\": 100,\n          \"stat_points\": 0\n        },\n        \"titles\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"The Glassest Cannon\",\n            \"source\": \"Stat Allocation\",\n            \"active\": true\n          }\n        ],\n        \"classes\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"Office Drone\",\n            \"level\": 1\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      \"reason\": \"Artie locked in his character creation stats, resulting in a 1 HP / 100% Crit build.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_FIZZ\",\n      \"set\": {\n        \"stats\": {\n          \"hp\": {\n            \"current\": 50,\n            \"max\": 50\n          },\n          \"mp\": {\n            \"current\": 200,\n            \"max\": 200\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"reason\": \"Maintaining Fizz's guide stats during the tutorial.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 2,\n      \"inventory\": [],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\n          \"container\": \"hand_right\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n          \"contents\": []\n        },\n        {\n          \"container\": \"hand_left\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n          \"contents\": []\n        }\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie is now terrified of his own fragility but curious about his new 'Crit' power.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_FIZZ\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 2,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\n          \"item\": \"ITEM_FIZZ_GUIDE\",\n          \"container\": \"hand_right\",\n          \"status\": \"held\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"item\": \"ITEM_GLOW_DUST\",\n          \"container\": \"satchel\",\n          \"status\": \"stowed\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\n          \"container\": \"hand_right\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_FIZZ\",\n          \"contents\": [\"ITEM_FIZZ_GUIDE\"]\n        },\n        {\n          \"container\": \"satchel\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_FIZZ\",\n          \"contents\": [\"ITEM_GLOW_DUST\"]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Fizz is professionally amused by Artie's disastrous build.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie met Fizz in the Character Creation Void and navigated a glitchy UI.

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nItem naming: use display_name for prose; use item_id only in JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\n\ufeffOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the

No recap.\n- Summaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\n- Use the continuity pack and state for continuity.\n- Use character_registry to keep names consistent in prose.\n- Timeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\n- State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\n- Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n- Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\n- Inventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- For held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\n- Continuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or '(locked)' only.\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\n- titles are arrays of objects with stable name fields; do not emit titles as plain strings.\n- If item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for ownership/custody labels in authoritative outputs.\n- Use item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\n- If a required event is not in the Scene Card, do not perform it.\n- Enforce scene-card durable constraints: honor `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, and `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\n- Respect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope` when proposing durable mutations; do not mutate physical custody in non-present/non-real scope unless explicitly marked override.\n- summary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\n- STATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\n- If state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\n- Return prose plus a state_patch JSON block.\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n- All *_updates arrays must contain objects; never emit bare strings as array entries.\n- character_updates.containers must be an array of objects with at least: container, owner, contents (array).\n- Durable-state mutation blocks are mandatory when applicable:\n- Required fields for durable registry entries (when creating NEW ids or filling missing required fields):\n  - item_registry_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry requires item_id and can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n    - INVALID: item_registry_updates = {\"set\": {\"ITEM_X\": {...}}}\n    - VALID: item_registry_updates = [{\"item_id\": \"ITEM_X\", \"set\": {...}}]\n  - plot_device_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry requires device_id and can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n    - INVALID: plot_device_updates = {\"set\": {\"DEVICE_X\": {...}}}\n    - VALID: plot_device_updates = [{\"device_id\": \"DEVICE_X\", \"set\": {...}}]\n\n  - item_registry_updates: set must include name, type, owner_scope, custodian, linked_threads, state_tags, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_device_id, replacement_of.\n  - plot_device_updates: set must include name, custody_scope, custody_ref, activation_state, linked_threads, constraints, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects; never an object with an `updates` field.\n- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.\n- If you mutate durable state, do not leave the same mutation only in prose.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n  - Each entry must include character_id, chapter, scene, inventory (full current list), containers (full current list), invariants_add (array), persona_updates (array).\n  - character_updates.inventory MUST be an array of objects, never string item ids.\n  - Inventory object shape: {\"item\": \"ITEM_or_name\", \"container\": \"hand_left|hand_right|<container>\", \"status\": \"held|carried|equipped|stowed\"}.\n  - Container object shape: {\"container\": \"<name>\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_id\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_id\", \"...\"]}.\n  - If you have a single persona update, still wrap it in an array of strings.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger and invariants using standard phrasing, e.g.:\n  - Avoid numeric mechanics in must_stay_true; store them in continuity system updates instead.\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> shard (carried, container=satchel)\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> longsword (carried, container=hand_right)\n  - container: satchel (owner=CHAR_example, contents=[shard, maps])\n  - milestone: shard_bind = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - milestone: maps_acquired = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - injury: right forearm scar / left arm filament\n  - ownership: shard (carried) / shard (bound but physical)\nScene card:\n{\n  \"cast_present\": [\n    \"Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon\",\n    \"Fizz\"\n  ],\n  \"cast_present_ids\": [\n    \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n    \"CHAR_FIZZ\"\n  ],\n  \"chapter\": 1,\n  \"conflict\": \"Artie's frustration with the System's logic versus Fizz's bureaucratic indifference.\",\n  \"constraints\": [\n    \"target_words: 2000\",\n    \"must_include_system_notifications\",\n    \"no_physical_combat\",\n    \"forbidden_visible: ITEM_wallet, ITEM_tie, ITEM_change\"\n  ],\n  \"continuity_system_focus\": [\n    \"stats\",\n    \"titles\",\n    \"classes\"\n  ],\n  \"device_presence\": [],\n  \"end_condition\": \"Artie confirms his stat allocation, locking in 1 HP and 100% Critical Hit rate.\",\n  \"forbidden_visible\": [\n    \"ITEM_wallet\",\n    \"ITEM_tie\",\n    \"ITEM_change\"\n  ],\n  \"goal\": \"Navigate the character creation UI while dealing with Fizz's condescending tutorial.\",\n  \"introduces\": [\n    \"Fizz\"\n  ],\n  \"introduces_ids\": [\n    \"CHAR_FIZZ\"\n  ],\n  \"ontological_scope\": \"real\",\n  \"required_callbacks\": [\n    \"SC_001_001\"\n  ],\n  \"required_in_custody\": [],\n  \"required_scene_accessible\": [\n    \"ITEM_FIZZ_GUIDE\"\n  ],\n  \"required_visible_on_page\": [\n    \"ITEM_FIZZ_GUIDE\"\n  ],\n  \"scene\": 2,\n  \"scene_id\": \"SC_001_002\",\n  \"scene_target\": \"Artie allocates his starting stats, accidentally creating a 'Crit-Only' glass cannon build.\",\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.1\",\n  \"thread_ids\": [\n    \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"\n  ],\n  \"timeline_scope\": \"present\",\n  \"transition_type\": \"none\",\n  \"ui_mechanics_expected\": [\n    \"HP\",\n    \"Critical Hit Rate\",\n    \"Stat Points\",\n    \"System Notification\"\n  ]\n}\nContinuity pack:\n{\n  \"cast_present\": [\n    \"Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon\",\n    \"Fizz\"\n  ],\n  \"constraints\": [\n    \"milestone: death_event = DONE\",\n    \"milestone: void_entry = DONE\",\n    \"location: Character Creation Void\",\n    \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Leather Wallet (lost)\",\n    \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Loose Change (lost)\",\n    \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Silk Tie (lost)\",\n    \"forbidden_visible: ITEM_wallet, ITEM_tie, ITEM_change\",\n    \"required_visible_on_page: ITEM_FIZZ_GUIDE\",\n    \"Artie stat_points: 50\",\n    \"Artie HP: 0/10 (initial state)\"\n  ],\n  \"location\": \"Character Creation Void\",\n  \"next_action\": \"Artie allocates his 50 starting stat points via the UI while Fizz provides condescending tutorial guidance.\",\n  \"open_threads\": [\n    \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"\n  ],\n  \"scene_end_anchor\": \"Artie arrived in the Character Creation Void after his physical form and mundane items dissolved into data.

I checked the floating red bar hovering above its translucent, jiggly head. \n\n[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 3] [HP: 45/45]\n\nForty-five health. At my current Strength of 12, with a base weapon damage of 4-6, I was looking at a nine-hit kill minimum, assuming the RNG gods didn't decide to spit on my shoes today. \n\n\"You know,\" I said, adjusting my grip on the rusted shortsword. \"In most worlds, puddles are for stepping in, not for getting dissolved by.\"\n\nThe slime responded by launching a glob of corrosive mucus. I rolled left, the grass staining my knees.\n\n[Stamina: 88/100]\n\n\"Missed me. Barely. That\u2019s a three-second cooldown on your spit, isn't it?\"\n\nI didn't wait for the confirmation. I lunged. The blade sank into the gelatinous mass with a sound like a heavy boot pulling out of thick mud.\n\n[Critical Hit! -14 HP]\n\n\"There we go. Who needs luck when you have math?\"\n\nThe slime shuddered, its HP bar dipping into the yellow. \n\n[HP: 31/45]\n\n\"One more of those and we can talk about your retirement plan,\" I muttered. My lungs burned slightly, a reminder that my Agility was still garbage. \n\n[Passive Skill Gained: Basic Analysis (Rank F)]\n[Description: You can see basic stats and cooldowns of enemies within 5 meters. You\u2019ve stopped guessing and started counting. Good for you.]\n\n\"Finally,\" I breathed, dodging another glob. \"The ding is coming. I can practically taste the experience points. They taste like copper and bad decisions.\" \n\nI swung again, the numbers popping in the air like neon confetti. This wasn't just a fight; it was a grind.
