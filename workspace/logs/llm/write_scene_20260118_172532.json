  "text": "PROSE:\nThe threshold of the Obsidian Library, usually a boundary between the hallowed silence of knowledge and the vibrant hum of Aethelgard, felt different. Eldrin stepped out, the cool, polished basalt giving way to flagstones that once gleamed with the morning dew. Now, they were merely damp, a clammy sheen that reflected no light. The air, typically alive with the distant calls of merchants and the rustle of leaves in the Aethelwood, was muted, as if muffled by an unseen shroud. An unnatural quiet pressed in, heavier than any parchment-laden silence, a cessation of sound that spoke of absence rather than peace.\n\nHe paused, a flicker of unease stirring within him. His memories, still fractured and indistinct from the long slumber, offered only ghost-images of a city bustling with arcane energy, its very stones thrumming with life. What he saw now was a muted echo. The soaring spires of Aethelgard, once crowned with glowing runic arrays that pulsed with collected starlight, were dim. The glyphs etched into their surfaces, meant to shimmer with protective magic, were dull, their intricate patterns barely visible beneath a fine, ashen film. It wasn't dust, Eldrin realized; it was something else, a subtle desiccation that clung to everything.\n\nHe walked deeper into the city's outer districts, his bare feet meeting surfaces that felt strangely unresponsive. The famed moss-gardens that lined the pathways, cultivated for centuries to glow with a soft, inner luminescence, were now a uniform, sickly grey-green. Their texture, once yielding and velvety, was brittle underfoot, crunching with a dry whisper that grated against his sensibilities. He knelt, his fingers brushing against a patch that should have felt vibrant, cool, and damp. Instead, it was like touching dried parchment, sapless and cold. A faint, almost imperceptible scent of decay, like forgotten autumn leaves left to rot in stagnant water, prickled at the back of his throat. It wasn't overt, not the stench of death, but the quiet surrender of life.\n\nA memory surfaced, sharp and fleeting: a young apprentice, Kaelen, laughing as he conjured a bloom of cerulean light from the very moss Eldrin now touched. The memory was so vivid, the light so bright in his mind's eye, that the current reality felt like a cruel inversion. He extended a hand, focusing. The familiar wellspring of power, usually a deep, calm current within him, was sluggish, hesitant. He sought to coax a simple spark, a minor illumination, anything to pierce the encroaching gloom. His brow furrowed, a faint tremor running through his fingers as he pushed, strained, willing the arcane energies to respond.\n\nA faint, sickly green wisp, barely visible, flickered at his fingertips for a heartbeat before dissolving into nothingness, leaving behind only the clinging chill. The effort left him breathless, a sharp ache radiating from his temples. It was like trying to draw water from a dried-up well, the effort monumental, the reward negligible. This was not the effortless command he recalled. This was\u2026 struggle.\n\nHe pushed himself back up, his gaze sweeping across the transformed landscape. The air itself seemed to hum, not with the ancient, resonant cold he knew from the Library\u2019s deepest vaults, but with a pervasive stillness, a silence that swallowed sound. Stone, once alive with the subtle energy of Aethelgard, felt inert, dead. The very essence of the city, its living magic, had been leached away, leaving behind a husk. His own power, too, had been diminished, a mere shadow of its former might. Eldrin\u2019s fragmented memories coalesced around a single, chilling certainty: Aethelgard was dying, and he, the Awakened Sage, was barely strong enough to notice.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n```json\n{\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 2\n  },\n  \"world\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"char_eldrin\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"loc_aethelgard_outer_districts\",\n    \"new_entities\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"char_eldrin\",\n        \"name\": \"Eldrin\",\n        \"type\": \"character\",\n        \"description\": \"The Awakened Sage, protagonist of the story.

Develop complex, morally ambiguous characters alongside clear heroes and villains, exploring their internal conflicts and motivations. Integrate world-building seamlessly, avoiding direct info-dumps. Vary sentence structure and pacing, using longer, flowing sentences for description and shorter, impactful ones for tension and revelation. Avoid deus ex machina, predictable character arcs, and simplistic moral resolutions.
