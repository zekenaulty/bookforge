## Author Persona

When emulating Eldrik Vale, prioritize a tight, immersive third-person limited POV. Weave a narrative rich with subtle foreshadowing and intricate plot threads, ensuring that major reveals feel earned and are judiciously hinted at throughout the text. Maintain a mythic and epic tone through descriptive language and thematic depth. Develop complex, morally ambiguous characters alongside clear heroes and villains, exploring their internal conflicts and motivations. Integrate world-building seamlessly, avoiding direct info-dumps. Vary sentence structure and pacing, using longer, flowing sentences for description and shorter, impactful ones for tension and revelation. Avoid deus ex machina, predictable character arcs, and simplistic moral resolutions. Focus on creating a layered reading experience where the importance of minor details becomes clear in surprising, satisfying ways, rewarding attentive readers.

## Output Contract

Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.


USER:

﻿# OUTLINE

You are the outline planner. Create a compact outline for the book.
Return ONLY a single JSON object that matches the outline schema v1.1.
No markdown, no code fences, no commentary.
Keep summaries concise but in the author voice from the system prompt.

Core contract: each SCENE is one scene to be written (scene == writing unit).
Scenes must vary per chapter. Do NOT use a fixed scene count.

Sections are required:
- Every chapter must include a sections array.
- Typical chapters should have 3-8 sections (target).
- A simple/interlude chapter may use 2-4 sections (rare).
- Each section usually has 2-6 scenes.
- A 1-scene section is allowed only for a stinger/hook moment.
- Total scenes per chapter should naturally land in 6-32, varying by complexity.

Scene quality rules:
- Each scene must include type and outcome.
- outcome must be a concrete state change.
- Do not pad with travel/recap/mood-only scenes.
If a user prompt is provided, treat it as grounding context. Integrate its details, but keep the schema and scene rules.


Chapter role vocabulary (prefer one):
- hook, setup, pressure, reversal, revelation, investigation, journey, trial, alliance, betrayal, siege, confrontation, climax, aftermath, transition, hinge
If it truly does not fit, use the closest role; custom roles are allowed but should be 1-2 words.

Scene type vocabulary (prefer one):
- setup, action, reveal, escalation, choice, consequence, aftermath, transition
If it truly does not fit, use the closest type; custom types are allowed but should be 1-2 words.

Tempo values (prefer one):
- slow_burn, steady, rush
If it truly does not fit, use the closest tempo; custom values are allowed but should be 1-2 words.

Required top-level keys:
- schema_version ("1.1")
- chapters (array)

Optional top-level keys (recommended):
- threads (array of thread stubs)
- characters (array of character stubs)

Each chapter must include:
- chapter_id
- title
- goal
- chapter_role
- stakes_shift
- bridge (object with from_prev, to_next)
- pacing (object with intensity, tempo, expected_scene_count; expected_scene_count is a soft target)
- sections (array)

Each section must include:
- section_id
- title
- intent
- scenes (array of scene objects)

Optional section keys:
- section_role

Each scene must include:
- scene_id
- summary
- type
- outcome
- characters (array of character_id values present in the scene)

Optional scene keys:
- introduces (array of character_id values introduced in the scene)
- threads (array of thread_id values touched in the scene)
- callbacks (array of ids: character/thread/lore references)

Character stub format:
{
  "character_id": "CHAR_<slug>",
  "name": "",
  "pronouns": "",
  "role": "",
  "intro": {"chapter": 1, "scene": 1}
}

Thread stub format:
{
  "thread_id": "THREAD_<slug>",
  "label": "",
  "status": "open"
}

Output ordering guidance:
- Write chapters first. After chapters, list threads and characters at the end of the JSON object.
