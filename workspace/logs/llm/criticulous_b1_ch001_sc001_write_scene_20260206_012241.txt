PROSE:

The hum of the breakroom’s fluorescent lights was a low-frequency torture device designed by architects who clearly hated the human soul. It vibrated at exactly the same pitch as Arthur Penhaligon’s mounting migraine. Arthur, known to exactly zero people as 'Artie' because he didn't have friends who liked him that much, stared through the scratched plexiglass of the Snack-Master 3000.

In his right hand, he gripped the 'Rusty Shortsword.' It wasn't a real weapon—at least, it wasn't supposed to be. It was a "Historical Achievement Award" for five years of loyal service to Data-Sync Solutions, a company that specialized in moving spreadsheets from one folder to another until the heat death of the universe. The sword was blunt, pitted with actual oxidation, and mounted on a cheap plastic plaque that had snapped off the moment Artie touched it. It was the perfect metaphor for his career: decorative, useless, and slightly toxic.

"Come on," Artie whispered, his voice cracking with the desperation of a man who had skipped breakfast to finish a report on cloud latency. "Just give me the Rings. Don't do this to me, Greg."

He had named the vending machine Greg. Greg was a jerk.

Artie leaned forward, his forehead pressing against the cold plastic. Inside, the metal coil holding the Zesty Ranchero Rings had made a valiant three-hundred-and-sixty-degree turn, only to stop exactly one millimeter short of liberation. The bag hung there, suspended over the abyss of the delivery chute, dangling by a single, defiant crimp of cellophane. 

It was a 1-in-20 failure. A critical miss on the most important roll of the day.

"I put in two dollars, Greg," Artie said, his grip tightening on the hilt of the rusty award. "The sticker says one-fifty. You have my fifty cents. You have my dignity. Just drop the damn rings."

The machine responded with a clicking sound that could only be interpreted as a robotic middle finger. The digital display, which usually read 'THANK YOU,' flickered and settled on a cryptic message: ERR_404_SNACK_NOT_FOUND.

"Not found? I can see it! It's right there!" Artie shouted, his frustration finally boiling over. 

His life was a series of these minor, statistically improbable tragedies. He was the guy who always got the shopping cart with the one locked wheel. He was the guy whose umbrella always inverted in a light breeze. He was the statistical anomaly that kept the insurance companies in business—the outlier on every bell curve of bad luck. If there was a one percent chance of something going wrong, Arthur Penhaligon was the guy who experienced it one hundred percent of the time.

He looked down at the 'Rusty Shortsword.' He wasn't a violent man, but the sheer absurdity of holding a medieval weapon in a 21st-century breakroom while being robbed by a machine was too much. 

"You want to play hardball, Greg? Fine. Let's talk about drop rates."

Artie didn't kick the machine. He knew the physics of that—he’d likely break a toe, and the machine wouldn't even wobble. Instead, he tried the 'reach-around.' He shoved his left hand into the delivery flap, pushing against the heavy anti-theft bar. His arm snaked upward, fingers straining toward the dangling bag of Zesty Ranchero Rings. 

[Stamina: 14/100]

A phantom notification flickered in the corner of his eye, but he dismissed it as a visual artifact of his migraine. He was so close. His fingertips brushed the crinkly plastic.

"Gotcha, you little..."

At that exact moment, the Snack-Master 3000 decided it was done being a vending machine and wanted to try its hand at being a Tesla coil. 

It started with a smell—the ozone-heavy scent of a dying motherboard. Then came the sound: a high-pitched whine that bypassed the ears and vibrated directly in the teeth. The fluorescent lights overhead didn't just flicker; they strobed with the intensity of a dying sun.

Artie felt a tingle in his fingertips. Not the 'my foot fell asleep' tingle, but the 'my atoms are reconsidering their current arrangement' tingle. 

The digital display on the machine went berserk. 

[SYSTEM OVERLOAD]
[UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DETECTED]
[INITIATING DEFENSIVE PROTOCOL: ARC LIGHT]

"Wait, what?" Artie had just enough time to blink.

The Rusty Shortsword in his right hand acted as a perfect lightning rod. The surge didn't just travel through the machine; it used Artie as a bridge to the grounding wire in the floor. A brilliant, blue-white arc of electricity jumped from the coil to Artie’s hand, channeled through the 'Historical Achievement Award,' and slammed into his chest.

The world didn't go black. It went neon.

Artie felt himself lifted off his feet. The sensation wasn't pain—it was too fast for pain. It was just... math. He felt his HP bar, a thing he didn't know he had, drain with the speed of a punctured bucket. 

-10 HP.
-25 HP.
-50 HP.

[Critical Hit!]
[Damage Type: Electrical/Pure]
[Status: Fried]

His last thought as a living human being was remarkably petty: *I hope the company has to pay out my life insurance for a vending machine accident.*

Then, the world finally did go black.

***

Artie floated. 

There was no floor, no ceiling, and importantly, no Greg. There was only a vast, echoing silence that felt like being tucked inside a velvet-lined coffin in the middle of deep space. 

"Hello?" he tried to say, but he didn't have a mouth. Or a throat. Or a body. He was just a point of consciousness, a lingering 'I am' in a sea of 'Not Yet.'

Suddenly, a box appeared in the darkness. It wasn't a physical box, but a projection of light that seemed to burn directly into his soul.

[Welcome to the After-Lobby!]
[User: Arthur Penhaligon]
[Status: Deceased (Cause: Terminal Irony)]

"Terminal irony?" Artie thought, the words echoing in the void. "It was a vending machine! That's not ironic, it's just bad luck!"

[Calculating Statistics...]
[Life Performance Review: D-]
[Notable Achievements: 'Survived 30 years without a personality,' 'Died to a Snack-Master 3000.']

"Hey! I had a personality! I liked... things!" Artie argued with the text. He was already falling back into his default state of being annoyed by everything. Even death had a snarky UI.

[Analysis Complete.]
[System detected a massive statistical anomaly during the death-event.]
[The 'Rusty Shortsword' (Quest Item: Joke) absorbed 400,000 volts of pure System-Energy.]
[User's 'Luck' stat has reached a negative integer, causing a stack overflow.]

The text began to scroll faster, turning from white to a threatening shade of crimson. 

[Recalculating...]
[Recalculating...]
[Error: Logic Loop Detected.]
[Solution: Assigning 'Glitch' Status.]

"Wait, what does that mean?" Artie felt a strange tugging sensation. It felt like his soul was being pulled through a very small straw. "I don't want to be a glitch! I just want my Ranchero Rings!"

[Character Creation Initialized.]
[Warning: Due to the 'Stack Overflow' event, all starting points have been automatically allocated to a single attribute to prevent total data corruption.]

A massive character sheet slammed into his field of vision. It was covered in numbers, most of them zeros. 

Strength: 1
Agility: 1
Intelligence: 1
Vitality: 1
Luck: -99

And then, at the very bottom, a single stat was glowing with the intensity of a thousand supernovas.

CRITICAL HIT RATE: 100%

[Allocation Finalized.]
[Class: The Glass Anomaly]
[Trait: Crit or Quit (Passive)]
[Description: You cannot deal normal damage. Every successful hit is a Critical Hit. However, your HP is locked at 1. Forever.]

"One HP?" Artie’s consciousness vibrated with horror. "A stiff breeze will kill me! A sneeze is a boss fight! You can't be serious!"

[The System is always serious. Especially about math.]
[Initiating Deployment to Tutorial Zone: The Whispering Woods.]
[Good luck, Arthur. You're going to need it. (Actually, you have none. Our apologies.)]

The darkness began to tear open, revealing a blinding green light. Artie felt himself falling, the sensation of having a body returning with the suddenness of a car crash. 

He was no longer in the breakroom. He was no longer in the void. 

He was falling toward a very sharp-looking bush.
