PROSE:

The coil groaned, a metallic rasp that sounded suspiciously like a middle finger in audio form. Arthur ‘Artie’ Penhaligon leaned his forehead against the cool, smudge-streaked glass of the breakroom vending machine, staring at the bag of Zesty Ranch Zings hanging by a literal plastic hair. 

"Don't do this, Betsy," Artie muttered, his voice echoing in the empty, fluorescent-lit room. "We’ve had a good run. I’ve given you three years of my life and approximately four thousand percent markup on generic corn chips. Just drop the bag."

The machine responded with a low-frequency hum that vibrated through Artie’s skull. The coil had completed its rotation, but the bag remained snagged on the edge of the metal spiral, dangling like a paratrooper whose parachute had caught on a tree.

Artie glanced at his right hand, which was currently white-knuckling his Leather Wallet. His left hand was full of the remaining Loose Change he’d scrounged from the depths of his desk drawer—three sticky nickels and a dime that looked like it had been through a war.

"Fine. You want to play hardball? I can play hardball."

He adjusted his Silk Tie, which felt like a polyester noose today. The air in the breakroom was stagnant, smelling of burnt popcorn and the quiet desperation of a Tuesday afternoon. Artie shifted his weight, preparing for the 'Vending Machine Calibration Maneuver,' otherwise known as hitting the side of the machine until something fell or he broke a knuckle.

"I have ten minutes before the quarterly report meeting," Artie told the glass. "That is ten minutes of my life I will never get back, Betsy. If I have to spend them watching my lunch defy gravity, I’m going to make it everyone’s problem."

He shoved the Loose Change into his pocket—or tried to, but his fingers were clumsy with irritation. One of the nickels escaped, clattering onto the linoleum floor and rolling under the machine.

[Sanity: 95/100]

"Of course," Artie sighed. "Because the universe hates me. Specifically."

He reached out and delivered a sharp, practiced palm-strike to the side of the machine. The glass rattled. The Zesty Ranch Zings didn't move. Instead, a small, red LED on the keypad began to blink.

[Status: System Error - 0x0000404]

"Oh, now you’re having an error? I’m the one with the error! I’m the one who paid two dollars for fifty cents worth of sodium!"

Artie grabbed the machine by its top edges and gave it a solid shake. Usually, this resulted in a satisfying thud of snacks. Today, it resulted in a sound like a swarm of angry hornets waking up inside the wiring. A blue spark jumped from the coin slot, singing the hair on Artie’s knuckles.

"Ow! You bit me? You actually bit me?"

[HP: 9/10]

The humming intensified. It wasn't just a hum anymore; it was a roar. The lights in the breakroom flickered, then died, leaving Artie in the sickly orange glow of the machine’s internal display. The numbers on the keypad began to spin wildly, cycling through digits faster than the eye could follow.

[Warning: Power Surge Detected]
[Warning: Logic Loop Initiated]

"Betsy, let's be reasonable," Artie said, his sarcasm finally giving way to a cold prickle of genuine concern. He tried to pull his hands away, but his palms felt stuck to the metal casing, as if gripped by a powerful electromagnet. "I don't even want the chips anymore. Keep the chips. Keep the change. Just let go."

The machine didn't let go. The smell of ozone filled the air, sharp and metallic. A jagged bolt of electricity arched from the 'E5' button directly into Artie’s chest, illuminating his skeleton like a cheap cartoon.

[Critical Hit!]
[HP: 2/10]

Artie’s jaw locked. His vision exploded into a kaleidoscope of error messages and flickering pixels. He could feel his Silk Tie beginning to smolder. His Leather Wallet flew from his hand, hitting the floor with a dull thud as his muscles spasmed.

"I... hate... ranch..." he managed to choke out.

The machine gave one final, violent shudder. A massive discharge of white light erupted from the display, engulfing Artie entirely. The sound was deafening—the sound of a world crashing, a server shutting down, a life being deleted.

[HP: 0/10] (locked)

The pain vanished instantly, replaced by a profound, echoing silence. The breakroom, the machine, and the Zesty Ranch Zings dissolved into a sea of static. Artie felt himself falling, not down, but out—drifting away from the mundane reality of office cubicles and toward a vast, dark void where the only thing visible was a single, flickering cursor.

Everything went black.
