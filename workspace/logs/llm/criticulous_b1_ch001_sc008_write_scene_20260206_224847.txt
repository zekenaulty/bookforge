PROSE:

The heavy oak doors of the Mayor’s office clicked shut behind me, the sound echoing through the marble-floored hallway like a judge’s gavel. I stood there for a second, my fingers cramping around the handle of the Participation Trophy in my left hand. It was cold, heavy, and currently pulsing with a faint, rhythmic light that seemed to say, *‘Hey, look at me! I’m a high-value target with the durability of a wet paper towel!’*

[Quest Updated: The Mayor’s Cut]
[Objective: Pay 500 Gold or provide 10 Crit-Forged items.]
[Time Remaining: 23:58:12]
[Penalty for Failure: Deportation to the Unpatched Wilds (Instant Death for 1 HP builds).]

"Great," I whispered, the word tasting like copper. "I’ve been in this world for less than three hours and I’m already being shook down by the local government. It’s like my internship at the accounting firm all over again, but with more chance of being eaten by a wolf."

I started down the hallway, my Broken Tutorial Sword still gripped in my right hand. I probably looked like a lunatic—a man in a linen tunic carrying a rusted piece of scrap metal and a glowing trophy that smelled vaguely of ozone and disappointment. I needed a plan. I needed gold. Most of all, I needed to not get breathed on too hard by anything with an offensive stat higher than zero.

I didn't even make it to the grand staircase before the air in the hallway changed. It grew heavy, smelling of expensive incense and polished steel. 

Leaning against a white marble pillar was a man who looked like he’d been designed by a committee of people who thought 'protagonist' was a personality trait. He was tall, draped in a Silk Cloak that probably cost more than my entire life insurance policy back home, and he had the kind of jawline you could use to chip ice. Above his head, the System labels flickered in a golden hue that made my eyes ache.

[Vane - Lvl 28] [Class: Sun-Blessed Paladin] [Affiliation: Order of the Golden Ratio]

Twenty-eight. He was Level 28. I was Level 2. I was a 'Statistical Anomaly' with 1 HP. He was a literal god-king in comparison. 

Vane didn't move as I approached, but his eyes followed me. They weren't looking at my face; they were locked onto the flickering neon text that hovered above my head, the one the gate scanners had so graciously gifted me.

[Title: Statistical Anomaly]

"So," Vane said, his voice a smooth baritone that made me want to punch him and then apologize for it. "You’re the glitch the Mayor is so worried about. The 'walking mint' with the broken numbers."

I stopped five paces back. "I prefer the term 'optimization specialist,' but 'glitch' works if you’re into brevity. And you are?"

"Vane," he said, pushing off the pillar. He moved with a fluid grace that suggested high Dexterity and a complete lack of soul. "I lead the local contingent of the Order. We maintain the balance of the System. And usually, when something is as... unbalanced... as you appear to be, it’s my job to see if it needs a patch."

I felt a cold sweat break out on my neck. My 1 HP bar was invisible to him—I hoped—but the [Statistical Anomaly] tag was a massive neon sign saying *'Examine Me.'*

"I’m already under a Variance Tax, Vane," I said, trying to keep my voice from cracking. "The Mayor’s already got his hand in my pockets. If you’re looking for a bribe, you’re about 500 gold too late."

Vane smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. He reached down to the hilt of the weapon at his hip. It was a Masterwork Rapier, the handguard shaped like a sunburst, the steel so bright it seemed to hold its own light.

"I don't care for gold," Vane said. "I care for data. The gate scanners reported a 100% Critical Hit rate. Statistically impossible. Even the most dedicated Luck-builds cap out at forty percent before the diminishing returns kick in. You’re a walking impossibility, Arthur."

"Artie," I corrected. "And it’s not impossible if the math allows it. It’s just... unlikely."

"Is it?" Vane took a step forward. The hallway felt smaller. "I want to see it. A friendly spar. Just to see how the 'Anomaly' handles a real blade. I’ll even set my damage output to 'Training' mode."

[System Notification: Vane has initiated a Duel Request (Friendly).]
[Rules: First to 10% HP or First Yield.]
[Warning: Even in 'Training' mode, minimum damage is 1 HP.]

My heart did a frantic tap-dance against my ribs. Minimum damage was 1 HP. If he so much as grazed my sleeve, I was a ghost. The 'Friendly' duel would be the shortest, most lethal encounter in the history of Oakhaven.

"I don’t spar for free," I said, forcing a smirk I didn't feel. I shifted my weight, making sure the Participation Trophy was visible. "And honestly? You’re not geared for it."

Vane paused, his hand tightening on the rapier’s hilt. "Excuse me?"

"You’re a Paladin. High defense, high sustain, moderate burst," I said, leaning into the bluff I’d used on the Mayor. "But you’re looking at my HP and thinking I’m a glass cannon. You think you can just tap me and the duel is over."

"You have 1 Health, Anomaly," Vane said, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "I can see the bar. It’s a single red pixel."

"Exactly," I said, stepping closer. I was within his reach now. If he drew that rapier, I was dead before I could blink. "Do you really think someone would walk into a Level 28 zone with 1 HP if they didn't have a way to make sure that 1 HP never moves? Have you ever heard of the 'Perfect Guard' build, Vane? Or are you too busy polishing your cape to read the high-level theory-crafting forums?"

Vane’s eyes narrowed. The rapier stayed in its sheath, but only just. "Perfect Guard is a myth. A theoretical build that requires frame-perfect timing and a 100% reflection rate. No one can maintain that."

"No one *normal*," I said, tapping the [Statistical Anomaly] tag above my head. "But I’m the guy who broke the gate scanner. I don't dodge, Vane. I don't need to. Every hit you land on me while my guard is up doesn't just do zero damage—it reflects 200% of the force back at the attacker. That’s why my HP is 1. It’s a bait. A lure for people like you who think a small number means a weak player."

I could see the gears turning in his head. In a world governed by stats, a 1 HP build was either a joke or a terrifying exploit. And since I was covered in 'Anomaly' flags and carrying a soul-bound trophy that was currently vibrating with ancient energy, Vane was leaning toward the latter.

"A reflection build," Vane muttered. He looked at my Broken Tutorial Sword. "And the 100% Crit rate?"

"If I reflect your attack, the counter-hit is a guaranteed Critical," I lied through my teeth. "It’s a closed loop of mathematical inevitability. You swing, you die. I stay at 1 HP. It’s very efficient. Saves a fortune on health potions."

Vane drew his Masterwork Rapier. The sound of steel on leather was like a whistle. He didn't lunge, but he held the point inches from my chest. I didn't move. I couldn't. My legs were basically made of jelly, but I forced my eyes to stay locked on his.

"One touch," Vane said. "If your 'Perfect Guard' is real, I’ll feel the kickback. If it’s not... well, the System will have one less bug to worry about."

"Go ahead," I said, my voice steady despite the fact that I was screaming internally. "But fair warning: Oakhaven’s insurance doesn't cover 'Suicide by Math.' If you break your fancy sword on my chest, don't come crying to me for the repair bill."

Vane hesitated. The rapier’s tip quivered. He was looking for a tell—a flinch, a shift in posture, anything that betrayed my terror. But I was so terrified I’d reached a state of catatonic stillness that apparently looked like supreme confidence.

[Status: Bluffed_Perfect_Guard is highly effective!]
[Vane is reconsidering his tactical approach.]

"You’re either the most dangerous man in this town," Vane said, slowly lowering the blade, "or the luckiest liar I’ve ever met."

"In this world, is there a difference?" I asked.

I didn't wait for him to respond. I turned my back on him—a move that was either the ultimate power play or the stupidest thing I’d ever done—and started walking toward the stairs. Every step felt like I was walking on a tightrope over a pit of spikes. I expected to feel a rapier through my spine at any second.

"This isn't over, Anomaly!" Vane called out behind me. I heard the *shink* of his rapier returning to its sheath. "The Variance Tax isn't the only thing you have to worry about. The Order will be watching. If you’re a virus, we’ll find the cure."

"Good luck with that," I muttered under my breath, finally reaching the stairs and rounding the corner. "I’ve been trying to find the cure for my own life for years. Let me know if you find a patch for 'Student Loans' while you're at it."

I didn't stop moving until I was out of the building and half a block away, tucked into the shadows of a merchant’s stall. I leaned against the cold stone wall, my breath coming in ragged gasps.

[Stamina: 14/100]
[Hunger: 10/100 (Flickering Orange)]

"Fizz?" I whispered.

A small, pixelated sprite popped into existence near my ear, her wings buzzing with nervous energy. "Artie! That was... wow. I actually thought I was going to have to find a new protagonist. Do you have any idea how hard it is to fill out the 'Death by Paladin' paperwork?"

"I almost died, Fizz. He had a Level 28 rapier. I could feel the heat coming off it."

"But you didn't!" Fizz chirped, doing a loop-de-loop. "You successfully bluffed a Sun-Blessed Paladin! Do you know what that does for your hidden 'Charisma-Exploit' modifier? Nothing, because I just made that up, but it was still impressive!"

I looked down at my hands. They were shaking. I still had 1 HP. I still had a 500-gold tax due in twenty-four hours. And now, I had a high-level fanatic convinced I was a walking WMD of reflection damage.

"I need gear," I said, pushing off the wall. "Real gear. Something that actually gives me Evasion or... or anything that isn't a linen tunic. If Vane sees me trip over a rug and die, the bluff is over."

"Well," Fizz said, pointing her tiny wand toward the town gates. "The Mayor mentioned the Low-Level Crypts. Lots of skeletons, very predictable patterns, and most importantly? High-drop rates for 'Coward’s Gear.' It’s perfect for you!"

"Coward’s gear," I sighed. "Fine. Lead the way. But if I see Vane again, I’m hiding in a barrel."

"A barrel? How classic! I’ll mark it on your map as a 'Tactical Stealth Container'."

I started walking, the Participation Trophy glowing in my hand, a beacon for every monster and rival in Oakhaven. I was a Statistical Anomaly, a 1 HP glitch in a world of giants, and somehow, I had to find a way to make the math work in my favor before the System decided to delete me for good.
