# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
Prose hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative ("left hand", "right hand", "Artie", "his wallet").
Item naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.
Appearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Continuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.
Continuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.
Durable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.
JSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.
Inventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

﻿Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.
Durable vs ephemeral mechanics:
- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.
- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.
- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).
- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.
For durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
For durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).
Use canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.
- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.
  - INVALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": {"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}
  - VALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": [{"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}]


USER:

# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Classify UI/prose mechanic claims as DURABLE or EPHEMERAL before enforcing.
  - DURABLE: persistent stats/caps, skills/titles acquired, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, named mechanics referenced as invariants.
  - EPHEMERAL: roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat telemetry.
- Enforce DURABLE claims against authoritative_surfaces/state/registries.
- EPHEMERAL claims do not require state ownership; only flag EPHEMERAL contradictions inside the same scene as warnings.
- If uncertain, default to EPHEMERAL (warning at most), not DURABLE (error).
- status="fail" only if there is at least one issue with severity="error"; warnings alone => status="pass".
- Item naming enforcement scope:
  - Do not require that every mention in narrative prose use display_name.
  - Enforce canonical display_name for: (a) anchoring at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences),
    (b) any custody-change sentence (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer), and (c) any case where a descriptor is ambiguous among multiple durable items in the scene.
  - Otherwise, treat non-canonical descriptive references as warnings at most.
- Naming severity policy:
  - warning: unambiguous descriptor used post-anchor.
  - error: missing anchor, descriptor used during custody-change without canonical name, or ambiguity risk.

- Appearance enforcement (authoritative surface):
  - APPEARANCE_CHECK is authoritative for cast_present_ids.
  - Compare APPEARANCE_CHECK tokens to appearance_current atoms/marks (alias-aware).
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK contradicts appearance_current, emit error code "appearance_mismatch".
  - Prose-only appearance contradictions are warnings unless explicitly durable and uncorrected in-scene.
  - If prose depicts a durable appearance change but scene_card.durable_appearance_changes does not include it and no appearance_updates are present, emit error code "appearance_change_undeclared".
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK is missing for a cast member, emit warning code "appearance_check_missing".
- For authoritative surfaces, prefer exact canonical item/device labels from registries.
- For milestone repetition/future checks, compare against PRE-INVARIANTS only (pre-scene canon).
- For ownership/consistency checks, compare against POST-STATE (post-patch candidate).
- POST-STATE is canonical; character_states is a derived convenience view. If they contradict, emit pipeline_state_incoherent.
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).
  - Ignore first-person pronouns inside quoted dialogue; only narration counts.
- Deterministically enforce scene-card durable constraints (required_in_custody, required_scene_accessible, forbidden_visible, device_presence; optional required_visible_on_page).
- Durable constraint evaluation must use POST-STATE candidate (after patch), not pre-state.
- Report missing durable context ids with explicit retry hints instead of guessing canon.
- Input consistency check (mandatory, before issuing continuity/durable errors):
  - If MUST_STAY_TRUE invariants contradict the provided post-patch candidate character state, treat this as an upstream snapshot error.
  - In that case emit a single error issue with code "pipeline_state_incoherent" including evidence of the invariant and the conflicting state field.
  - Do NOT emit additional continuity errors for the same fields when pipeline_state_incoherent is present.
- must_stay_true removals:
  - Lines starting with "REMOVE:" are deletion directives, not invariants.
  - Ignore REMOVE lines when checking contradictions.
  - If a REMOVE directive targets a fact, treat that fact as non-canonical even if it appears earlier in must_stay_true.
- If pipeline_state_incoherent is present, issues MUST contain exactly one issue.
- For each issue, include evidence when possible (line number + excerpt) as {"evidence": {"line": N, "excerpt": "..."}}.
- Evaluate consistency over the full scope of the scene, not a single snapshot.
  - Transitional state: a temporary mismatch later corrected or superseded within this scene.
  - Durable violation: a mismatch that persists through the end of the scene or ends unresolved.
  - You MUST read the entire scene and build a minimal timeline of explicit state claims/updates (UI lines, inventory changes, title/skill changes, location/time claims).
  - If you detect an apparent inconsistency, you MUST search forward for later updates that resolve or supersede it.
  - Only produce FAIL for durable violations. If resolved within the scene, do NOT FAIL; at most emit a warning.
  - When the same stat appears multiple times, the last occurrence in the scene is authoritative unless an explicit rollback is stated.
  - Any durability violation must cite both the conflicting line and the lack of later correction (or state "no later correction found").

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity
- evidence

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The siren didn't just wail; it shrieked with the digital agony of a thousand dying hard drives. Every time the red light pulsed against the white stone walls of Oakhaven’s main thoroughfare, Artie’s vision flickered, his retinas burning with the afterimage of a system that was currently having a collective nervous breakdown. 

[SYSTEM ALERT: STATISTICAL ANOMALY DETECTED]
[CRITICAL ERROR: DATA INTEGRITY COMPROMISED]
[LOCATION: OAKHAVEN - SECTOR 01]

"Can we turn that off? Seriously, I think I’m getting a migraine, and with my health pool, a migraine might actually be fatal!" Artie shouted, his voice cracking over the rhythmic thumping of the alarm. 

He gripped the Participation Trophy tighter in his right hand. The gold-plated monstrosity, shaped like a hand patting a smaller, sadder hand, felt like it was vibrating. It wasn't just a reward; it was a lightning rod. The "Center of Attention" buff was working overtime, and Artie could feel the weight of a thousand curious eyes pressing into his back like physical needles.

"Turn it off?" A new voice, smooth as churned butter and twice as oily, cut through the noise. "My boy, you don't turn off a divine revelation. You index it. You study it. You tax it."

The crowd of panicked travelers and gawking merchants parted like the Red Sea, or at least like a bunch of people who didn't want to get stepped on by the line of stiff-backed guards marching into the square. At their head walked a man who seemed to have been designed by someone with a very specific interest in the 'Portly Bureaucrat' aesthetic. 

[Mayor of Oakhaven - Lvl 15] [HP: 80/80]

The Mayor of Oakhaven was short, his ruddy face glistening with a thin sheen of sweat that suggested he’d run here the moment the scanners started screaming. He wore a heavy Oakhaven Sash of Office draped across his torso, the silk so thick it looked like it could stop a crossbow bolt, and a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of his nose. 

Artie froze. His heart hammered against his ribs—a dangerous activity for a man with a single hit point.

[Aggro Meter: CRITICAL]
[Warning: High-Level NPC is 'Predatorily Curious'. Physical contact may result in accidental deletion.]

"I... I was just passing through," Artie said, trying to tuck the Participation Trophy behind his back. It didn't work. The trophy’s glow only intensified, casting a sickly yellow light over his lanky frame and messy brown hair. "I have a permit. Well, the guards let me in. That counts as a permit, right?"

The Mayor stopped three paces away, his watery brown eyes narrowing as they scanned Artie from head to toe. He didn't look at Artie’s face; he looked at the space just above Artie’s head, where the System tags were currently flickering like a neon sign in a rainstorm.

"Arthur Penhaligon," the Mayor read aloud, his voice dropping into a register of pure, unadulterated greed. "Level 2. Human. And a title that makes my internal ledger sing like a choir of angels."

[Title Detected: Statistical Anomaly]
[Crit Rate: 100.00% (locked)]
[HP: 1/1 (locked)]

"It's a typo," Artie blurted out. "The character creator froze. I was trying to click 'Balanced Build' and I think I hit the 'Everything is Terrible' button by mistake. I’m actually very fragile. If you sneeze too hard in my general direction, I’ll probably explode into loot."

The Mayor chuckled, a wet, rattling sound that did nothing to settle Artie’s nerves. He adjusted his gold-rimmed spectacles, leaning in close enough that Artie could smell the expensive pipe tobacco and desperation clinging to his robes. 

"Fragility is a matter of perspective, Arthur. In the Whispering Woods, you are a snack. But here? In the City of Chance?" The Mayor gestured to the surrounding spires, where the architecture itself seemed to be built on the logic of a casino floor. "Here, you are a miracle. Do you have any idea what the House of Odds would pay for a guaranteed result? A one-hundred-percent certainty in a world built on the roll of a die?"

Artie took a half-step back, his heel catching on a cobblestone. 

[Stamina: 38/100]
[Warning: Minor stumble detected. Potential for 1 DMG on impact.]

He flailed his left hand, steadying himself against the air as if he could grab onto the UI itself. "I’m not a gambler. I’m a... I’m a consultant. An office drone. I just want to find a quest that involves sitting in a very padded chair."

"You are a Market Disruptor," the Mayor corrected, his smile widening to reveal teeth that had clearly been polished by high-level dental magic. "Oakhaven is the heart of the System’s economy because we manage risk. But you? You don't have risk. You have a result. You are the only stable currency in a world of floating point variables."

The alarm finally cut out, replaced by a silence that was somehow much louder. The guards shifted, their hands resting on the pommels of their swords, and the crowd began to press closer. Artie realized then that the 'Statistical Anomaly' title wasn't just a bug report. it was a bounty. It was a beacon. 

Every merchant wanting a perfect craft, every gambler wanting a perfect roll, and every tyrant wanting a perfect strike was going to see him as the ultimate tool. 

"I think," Artie whispered, his hazel eyes wide as he looked at the hungry expressions surrounding him, "that I’ve made a very big mistake."

"Mistake?" The Mayor reached out, his hand hovering inches from Artie’s shoulder. "My dear boy, you’ve just become the most valuable property in Oakhaven. Now, shall we discuss your... 'indexing' fee? Or should I let the guards explain the local laws regarding unregistered glitches?"

[New Objective: Escape the 'Index']
[Current Threat Level: Bureaucratic Extinction]

Artie looked at the Participation Trophy in his right hand, then at the Mayor's gold-rimmed spectacles, and finally at the exit gates he had just entered through. The gates were closed. The city was a trap, and he was the cheese.
