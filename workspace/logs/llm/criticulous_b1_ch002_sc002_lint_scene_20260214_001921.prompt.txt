# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
Prose hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative ("left hand", "right hand", "Artie", "his wallet").
Item naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.
Appearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Continuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.
UI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says "always include".
Continuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.
Durable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.
JSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.
Inventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it unless explicitly removing a stale fact with REMOVE and restating the current truth.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.
Durable vs ephemeral mechanics:
- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.
- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.
- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).
- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.
For durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
For durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).
Use canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.

- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.
  - INVALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": {"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}
  - VALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": [{"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}]


USER:

# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Classify UI/prose mechanic claims as DURABLE or EPHEMERAL before enforcing.
  - DURABLE: persistent stats/caps, skills/titles acquired, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, named mechanics referenced as invariants.
  - EPHEMERAL: roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat telemetry.
- Enforce DURABLE claims against authoritative_surfaces/state/registries.
- EPHEMERAL claims do not require state ownership; only flag EPHEMERAL contradictions inside the same scene as warnings.
- UI gate:
  - If scene_card.ui_allowed=false and any authoritative UI blocks appear, emit issue code 'ui_gate_violation' (severity depends on lint mode).
  - If ui_allowed is missing and UI blocks appear, emit 'ui_gate_unknown' (warning) requesting explicit ui_allowed; do not fail solely for missing flag.
  - Inline bracketed UI (e.g., [HP: 1/1]) is still UI and should be gated the same way; do not embed UI mid-sentence.
- If uncertain, default to EPHEMERAL (warning at most), not DURABLE (error).
- status="fail" only if there is at least one issue with severity="error"; warnings alone => status="pass".
- Item naming enforcement scope:
  - Do not require that every mention in narrative prose use display_name.
  - Enforce canonical display_name for: (a) anchoring at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences),
    (b) any custody-change sentence (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer), and (c) any case where a descriptor is ambiguous among multiple durable items in the scene.
  - Otherwise, treat non-canonical descriptive references as warnings at most.
- Prose hygiene: flag internal ids or container codes in narrative prose (CHAR_, ITEM_, THREAD_, DEVICE_, hand_left, hand_right).
- Naming severity policy:
  - warning: unambiguous descriptor used post-anchor.
  - error: missing anchor, descriptor used during custody-change without canonical name, or ambiguity risk.

- Appearance enforcement (authoritative surface):
  - APPEARANCE_CHECK is authoritative for cast_present_ids.
  - Compare APPEARANCE_CHECK tokens to appearance_current atoms/marks (alias-aware).
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK contradicts appearance_current, emit error code "appearance_mismatch".
  - Prose-only appearance contradictions are warnings unless explicitly durable and uncorrected in-scene.
  - If prose depicts a durable appearance change but scene_card.durable_appearance_changes does not include it and no appearance_updates are present, emit error code "appearance_change_undeclared".
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK is missing for a cast member, emit warning code "appearance_check_missing".
- For authoritative surfaces, prefer exact canonical item/device labels from registries.
- For milestone repetition/future checks, compare against PRE-INVARIANTS only (pre-scene canon).
- For ownership/consistency checks, compare against POST-STATE (post-patch candidate).
- POST-STATE is canonical; character_states is a derived convenience view. If they contradict, emit pipeline_state_incoherent.
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).
  - Ignore first-person pronouns inside quoted dialogue; only narration counts.
- Deterministically enforce scene-card durable constraints (required_in_custody, required_scene_accessible, forbidden_visible, device_presence; optional required_visible_on_page).
- Durable constraint evaluation must use POST-STATE candidate (after patch), not pre-state.
- Report missing durable context ids with explicit retry hints instead of guessing canon.
- Input consistency check (mandatory, before issuing continuity/durable errors):
  - If MUST_STAY_TRUE invariants contradict the provided post-patch candidate character state, treat this as an upstream snapshot error.
  - In that case emit a single error issue with code "pipeline_state_incoherent" including evidence of the invariant and the conflicting state field.
  - Do NOT emit additional continuity errors for the same fields when pipeline_state_incoherent is present.
- must_stay_true removals:
  - Lines starting with "REMOVE:" are deletion directives, not invariants.
  - Ignore REMOVE lines when checking contradictions.
  - If a REMOVE directive targets a fact, treat that fact as non-canonical even if it appears earlier in must_stay_true.
- If pipeline_state_incoherent is present, issues MUST contain exactly one issue.
- For each issue, include evidence when possible (line number + excerpt) as {"evidence": {"line": N, "excerpt": "..."}}.
- Evaluate consistency over the full scope of the scene, not a single snapshot.
  - Transitional state: a temporary mismatch later corrected or superseded within this scene.
  - Durable violation: a mismatch that persists through the end of the scene or ends unresolved.
  - You MUST read the entire scene and build a minimal timeline of explicit state claims/updates (UI lines, inventory changes, title/skill changes, location/time claims).
  - If you detect an apparent inconsistency, you MUST search forward for later updates that resolve or supersede it.
  - Only produce FAIL for durable violations. If resolved within the scene, do NOT FAIL; at most emit a warning.
  - When the same stat appears multiple times, the last occurrence in the scene is authoritative unless an explicit rollback is stated.
  - Any durability violation must cite both the conflicting line and the lack of later correction (or state "no later correction found").

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity
- evidence

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The front window of Barnaby’s Bargains & Blunders didn't just break; it detonated inward in a spray of enchanted glass that hummed with a low, dissonant frequency. Outside, the street was a churning sea of low-level Goblins and agitated Town Guards, all of them drawn by the invisible, screaming siren of Artie’s presence.

[Aggro Meter: 98%] (MAXIMUM PROXIMITY ALERT)

The bar at the top of Artie’s vision wasn't just red anymore. It was a violent, throbbing violet, pulsing in time with the frantic beat of his heart. Every time it flashed, a new thud echoed against the reinforced oak of the shop’s rear door.

"Artie, we really, really need to go!" Fizz shrieked, her neon blue hair flickering so fast she looked like a strobe light in a blender. Her diminutive form zipped around his head, leaving a pixelated trail that smelled faintly of ozone and desperate math. "The System is literally spawning mobs in the alleyway just to fill the density requirements for your aggro signature!"

Artie ignored her, his eyes locked on the heavy iron pedestal at the center of the room. In his left hand, the Participation Trophy felt impossibly heavy, its gold-plated surface warm and vibrating with the 'Monster Beacon' status that had turned his life into a nightmare. He shifted his grip, his thumb brushing the vending machine scar on his right knuckle—a souvenir from the mundane world that felt like a lifetime ago.

"The cloak," Artie wheezed, his slight build trembling under the weight of the collective hatred of Oakhaven. "Fizz, if I don't get that cloak, I'm just a one-hit-point wonder waiting for a stray breeze to delete me."

He stepped toward the pedestal. Resting atop it was a glass case reinforced with bands of shimmering, ethereal silver. Inside, a garment of neon yellow fur sat like a neon middle finger to the concept of stealth. This was the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion. 

[Object: High-Level Shop Lock]
[Status: Secure]
[Requirement: Lvl 50 Thievery OR Master Key]

"It’s a Level 50 lock, Artie!" Fizz hovered in front of the silver bands, her translucent blue skin glowing with alarm. "You’re Level 2! Your Thievery skill is literally 'Non-Existent'! If you touch that, the security feedback will vaporize your last health point before you can even say 'oops'!"

"I'm not going to pick it," Artie said, pulling back his right fist. He felt the familiar, glitchy hum in his veins—the absolute, mathematical certainty of the Statistical Anomaly. "I'm going to apply some data entry logic. If the input is forceful enough, the system has to accept the result."

[Crit Rate: 100%] (Locked)

Another boom shook the shop. A green, clawed hand forced its way through the shattered front window, grasping blindly at the air. The Aggro Meter spiked, the violet bar now bleeding into a static-filled black.

[Aggro Meter: 99%] (CRITICAL DENSITY REACHED)

"Artie, don't!"

"Percussive Maintenance!" Artie yelled, throwing his fist forward.

He didn't aim for the glass. He aimed for the very center of the High-Level Shop Lock, the point where the silver bands met the iron pedestal. As his knuckle made contact, the world didn't just register a hit. It registered a catastrophe.

[CRITICAL HIT!]
[Damage: NaN]
[System Error: Integer Overflow detected in 'Physical Resistance' calculation.]

The sound wasn't a crash. It was the sound of a thousand crystal flutes being dropped into a jet engine. A blinding flash of gold light erupted from the point of impact, expanding outward in a perfect sphere. Artie felt the air get sucked out of the room as the System struggled to reconcile a Level 2 punch delivering an infinite amount of damage to a Level 50 security measure.

The High-Level Shop Lock didn't break. It ceased to be a solid object. It dissolved into a shimmering cloud of gold dust, the silver bands twisting into liquid light before evaporating into the ceiling. The shockwave blew the encroaching Goblin back through the window and sent the shop’s remaining shelves clattering to the floor.

As the dust settled, the glass case was gone. The pedestal was scorched. And there, floating in the center of a fading golden haze, was the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion, its neon yellow fur ruffling in the sudden vacuum.

[System Notification: 'High-Level Shop Lock' has been removed from reality.]
[Title Progress: 'Gate-Crasher' (Active)]

Artie stood there, his hand still extended, his chest heaving. The golden dust coated his rumpled dress shirt like expensive glitter. 

"Did... did you just delete the lock?" Fizz whispered, her eyes wide and white.

Artie didn't answer. He just stared at the cloak, the only thing standing between him and the 99% aggro nightmare currently clawing at the back door.
