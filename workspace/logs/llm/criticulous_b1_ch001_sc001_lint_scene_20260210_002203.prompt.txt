# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
Item naming: use display_name for prose; use item_id only in JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Continuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.
Continuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.
Durable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.
Inventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

﻿Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.
Durable vs ephemeral mechanics:
- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.
- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.
- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).
- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.
For durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
For durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).
Use canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.


USER:

﻿# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Classify UI/prose mechanic claims as DURABLE or EPHEMERAL before enforcing.
  - DURABLE: persistent stats/caps, skills/titles acquired, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, named mechanics referenced as invariants.
  - EPHEMERAL: roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat telemetry.
- Enforce DURABLE claims against authoritative_surfaces/state/registries.
- EPHEMERAL claims do not require state ownership; only flag EPHEMERAL contradictions inside the same scene as warnings.
- If uncertain, default to EPHEMERAL (warning at most), not DURABLE (error).
- status="fail" only if there is at least one issue with severity="error"; warnings alone => status="pass".
- Treat only authoritative surfaces as canonical-check targets; do not enforce canonical labels in narrative prose.
- For authoritative surfaces, prefer exact canonical item/device labels from registries.
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).
- Deterministically enforce scene-card durable constraints (`required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; optional `required_visible_on_page`).
- Report missing durable context ids with explicit retry hints instead of guessing canon.

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The Snack-O-Matic 9000 was a cruel, unyielding mistress, and she was currently holding my lunch hostage.

I stood in the office breakroom, the fluorescent lights overhead flickering with a rhythmic, soul-sucking hum that matched the dull throb in my temples. My Polyester Suit—a bargain-bin special that possessed the breathability of a plastic trash bag—was already sticking to my lower back. It was 2:15 PM on a Tuesday. I had three spreadsheets due by five, a supervisor who used "synergy" as a threat, and a stomach that was currently performing a convincing impression of a dying whale.

I looked down at my right hand. The One Dollar Coin sat there, a dull gold disc that represented the absolute limit of my liquid assets until Friday’s direct deposit hit. This wasn't just a dollar; it was a bridge to the only thing that could get me through the afternoon: a bag of Zesty Ranch Zings.

"Don't do it, Artie," I whispered to myself. "She smells weakness."

I ignored my own advice. I leaned forward, the Plastic ID Badge clipped to my belt clinking against the machine’s glass. I slid the coin into the slot.

The machine swallowed it with a mechanical gulp. I pressed the buttons: B-4. The metal spiral began to rotate. It was a slow, agonizing crawl, the bag of Zings inching forward like a condemned man walking toward the gallows. The spiral completed its turn. The bag tipped. It leaned.

And then, it stopped.

The bag was dangling by a single, microscopic corner of crimped plastic, caught on the very tip of the metal coil. It swayed gently in the stagnant air of the breakroom, mocking me.

"You have got to be kidding me," I muttered, pressing my forehead against the cool glass. 

I checked my internal stats. If I had a UI, my 'Patience' bar would be flashing red and emitting a high-pitched whine. I looked around. The breakroom was empty, save for a half-empty pot of coffee that looked like it had been brewed during the Nixon administration. No witnesses.

I gripped the sides of the Snack-O-Matic. "Give. Me. My. Zings."

I gave the machine a firm shake. The glass rattled. The bag of chips didn't budge. It just swung there, a neon-orange middle finger to my existence. 

My life felt like a series of poorly rolled checks. My 'Spreadsheet Management' skill was at a respectable Rank 4, sure, but it didn't help when the physical world decided to glitch out on me. I was a Level 28 Human Male with a 'Passive-Aggressive Emailing' sub-class and a 'Title' that probably read [Unsuspecting Victim of Late-Stage Capitalism].

I reached into the dispenser flap at the bottom, my arm disappearing into the dark, crumb-filled maw of the machine. I reached up, trying to find the bottom of the B-4 tray. My fingers brushed against cold metal and something that felt suspiciously like a petrified gummy bear.

"Just... one... inch..."

That’s when I heard it. A low, predatory growl coming from the guts of the machine. Not the sound of a cooling fan, but the sound of an electrical transformer reaching its breaking point. 

A blue spark jumped from the coin return to my thumb.

[Critical Hit! -10 HP]

The world didn't just go dark; it inverted. The beige walls of the breakroom shattered into a million jagged pixels. My Polyester Suit felt like it was melting into my skin, and for a brief, agonizing second, I could see the skeletal structure of my own hand illuminated by a surge of pure, unadulterated voltage.

I didn't even have time to scream. My heart, which had been at a steady 75 BPM, decided to skip the rest of the song and go straight to the silence at the end of the track.

[HP: 0/10]
[Status: Deceased]

Then came the void.

It wasn't black, exactly. It was the color of a monitor that was turned on but displaying nothing—a deep, humming grey that stretched out into infinity. I didn't have a body anymore, or if I did, it was currently being handled by the local paramedics back in the breakroom. I was just a point of consciousness floating in the digital soup.

"Great," I thought. "I died for Zesty Ranch Zings. My obituary is going to be a punchline."

Suddenly, a box of light snapped into existence in front of my non-existent eyes. It wasn't a heavenly gate or a tunnel of light. It was a window. A UI window.

[System Notification]
[User 'Arthur Penhaligon' has successfully disconnected from Server: EARTH_01.]
[Reason: Fatal Hardware Error (Vending Machine Malfunction).]

"Fatal hardware error?" I tried to shout, but the words only appeared as a thought-echo in the grey. "It was a bag of chips! I want a refund!"

[Scanning soul for compatible attributes...]
[Warning: Statistical Anomaly Detected.]
[Your 'Luck' stat is so low it has triggered an Integer Underflow.]

The grey void began to vibrate. 

[Recalculating...]
[Due to your unique circumstances, you have been selected for the 'Beta-Glitch' Compensation Package.]

[Welcome to the System. Please prepare for Character Creation.]

I stared at the floating text. This was it. The 'Ding' I’d been waiting for my entire life, even if I’d had to die to hear it. Somewhere in the back of my mind, the ghost of my Passive-Aggressive Emailing skill whispered that I should probably ask to speak to a manager about the electrocution, but the rest of me was too busy watching the numbers start to roll.
