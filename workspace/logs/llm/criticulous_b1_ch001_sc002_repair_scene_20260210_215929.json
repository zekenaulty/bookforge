Fizz holds the System Manual in her right hand.\n\nPROSE:\n\"Fifty points,\" Artie Penhaligon muttered, his voice echoing in the vast, sterile whiteness of the Character Creation Void. \"Fifty points to define the rest of my digital afterlife. No pressure.\"\n\n[Available Stat Points: 50]\n\nThe translucent blue screen hummed with the faint, electronic buzz of a dying refrigerator. It hovered just out of reach, flickering every time Artie tried to focus on the numbers. His previous life\u2014the spreadsheets, the lukewarm coffee, the final, ignominious defeat at the hands of a Break-O-Matic 3000\u2014was a fading smudge of data. Now, he was just a man in a grey-mesh jumpsuit that felt suspiciously like cheap polyester.\n\n\"Actually, there\u2019s a lot of pressure,\" a voice chirped. It had the clipped, manic energy of a customer service representative who had been drinking nothing but espresso and spite. \"And you\u2019re taking forever. I have three other 'accidental vending machine casualties' waiting in the queue, and two of them actually had a 401k. You\u2019re dragging down my throughput, Arthur.\"\n\nArtie rotated in the weightless expanse, which was a lot harder than it looked. A small, glowing sprite with neon-pink hair and a holographic clipboard was hovering three feet away. She was wearing a tiny, sharp-shouldered suit and a pair of spectacles that looked far too large for her face.\n\n\"I'm Fizz,\" she said, finally looking up from her screen to give him a look of profound disappointment. \"Your dedicated System Guide. Think of me as the person who explains why you\u2019re about to die again, but with better grammar.\"\n\n\"I died because of a bag of Cool Ranch chips, Fizz. I think we can skip the lecture on dignity.\"\n\n\"Dignity isn't a stat, unfortunately,\" Fizz said, tapping her clipboard. The System Manual glowed with a soft, judgmental light in her right hand. \"Though in your case, it would have been a dump stat anyway. Now, look at the screen. We don't have all day. The System is currently calculating your base performance metrics based on your... let's call it a 'career' in data entry.\"\n\n[Character: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]\n[Class: Office Drone (Lvl 1)]\n[HP: 10/10]\n[MP: 10/10]\n[Strength: 4]\n[Agility: 3]\n[Constitution: 5]\n[Intelligence: 8]\n[Luck: 1]\n\n\"Luck: 1?\" Artie pointed at the screen. \"I got struck by a freak electrical surge in a breakroom. That\u2019s at least a Luck zero event.\"\n\n\"The fact that you\u2019re even here and not just a pile of carbonized meat is a miracle of the System\u2019s mercy,\" Fizz countered, her wings buzzing with irritation. \"Now, distribute the points. Constitution is the standard recommendation for beginners. It helps you not explode when a slime looks at you funny. Or, since you spent thirty years staring at a monitor, maybe Intelligence? Not that it helped you with the vending machine.\"\n\nArtie stared at the numbers. They felt like a trap. If he played it safe, he\u2019d just be a slightly more durable version of the guy who died for a snack. He looked past the primary stats, searching for something else. Down at the very bottom of the menu, obscured by a flickering line of dead pixels, was a stat that didn't have a label.\n\n\"What's this one?\" he asked, pointing to the glitching bar.\n\nFizz squinted, her glasses sliding down her nose. \"That? Oh, that\u2019s just a legacy overflow from the combat engine. It\u2019s supposed to be 'Critical Hit Rate,' but it\u2019s hard-capped for your level. You shouldn't even be able to see it. It\u2019s basically a bug. Move on.\"\n\n\"A bug?\" Artie felt a familiar spark of corporate rebellion. \"You mean it\u2019s an exploit?\"\n\n\"It\u2019s a non-functional variable, Arthur. If you put points into it, you\u2019re essentially throwing them into the trash. Like your degree in Liberal Arts.\"\n\nArtie looked at the fifty points. Then he looked at his ten HP. If he put all fifty into Constitution, he might have sixty HP. In a world of monsters and magic, sixty HP was still just a one-shot waiting to happen. But if he could hit... really, really hard...\n\n\"You know,\" Artie said, his finger hovering over the glitched bar. \"In my old job, whenever the software glitched, we didn't fix it. We just called it a feature and charged the client double.\"\n\n\"Don't you dare,\" Fizz warned, her voice dropping an octave. \"If you mess with the ratio, the System\u2019s auto-balancer will kick in. It has to maintain parity. You increase your offensive output that much, and it\u2019ll strip your survivability to compensate. You'll be a glass cannon without the cannon part. Just a glass... thing. A glass vase. Easy to break and useless in a fight.\"\n\n\"I've spent my whole life being a 'beginner,'\" Artie muttered. \"Let's see what happens when the math breaks.\"\n\nHe slammed his hand against the screen, dragging the slider for the glitched stat all the way to the right. \n\n[Warning: Stat Allocation exceeds recommended thresholds for Level 1.]\n[Warning: System Parity Error. Compensating...]\n[Warning: Logic Loop detected. Critical Hit Rate cannot exceed 100% at current rank.]\n\n\"Arthur, stop!\" Fizz shouted, dropping her clipboard as she lunged for the screen.\n\nArtie didn't stop. He dumped all fifty points. The blue screen turned a violent, bleeding red. The numbers began to spin, blurring into a mess of illegible symbols before snapping into place with a sound like a gunshot.\n\n[Stat Allocation Confirmed.]\n[Calculating adjustments...]\n\nThe grey-mesh jumpsuit tightened around him, vibrating with a strange, humming energy. He felt lighter. Too light. Like he was made of paper.\n\n[Character: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]\n[Class: Statistical Anomaly (Lvl 1)]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Strength: 1]\n[Agility: 1]\n[Constitution: 1]\n[Intelligence: 1]\n[Crit Rate: 100% (LOCKED)]\n\n\"One HP?\" Artie whispered, staring at the single, lonely digit. \"I have one hit point?\"\n\nFizz was staring at the screen, her mouth hanging open. She slowly reached out and picked up her clipboard, her hand shaking.\n\n\"You idiot,\" she breathed. \"You absolute, unmitigated moron. You just traded your entire existence for a guaranteed crit. You have one HP. Do you know what that means? A stiff breeze could kill you. A sneeze would be a boss fight. If you stub your toe, you\u2019re deleted!\"\n\n\"But I\u2019ll never miss a crit,\" Artie said, trying to sound more confident than he felt. His heart\u2014which he could now feel beating with terrifying clarity against his ribs\u2014thudded once.\n\n[System Notification: Build 'Crit or Quit' has been finalized.]\n[Title Gained: Glassest of Cannons]\n[Description: You have 1 HP and 100% Crit Rate. You are a mathematical impossibility. The System hates you, but it\u2019s impressed by your audacity.]\n\n\"Finalized?\" Artie asked. \"Wait, can I re-spec?\"\n\n\"No,\" Fizz said, her voice trembling with a mix of horror and hysterical laughter. \"The System just locked the build. You\u2019re a glitch, Arthur. A walking, talking error message. And I\u2019m the one who has to guide you through a tutorial zone where the local wildlife has more health than a god, but you... you're a paper plate in a hurricane.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Artie said, looking down at his translucent, fragile-looking hands. \"At least I won't have to worry about a long-term retirement plan anymore.\"\n\n[Initialization Complete.]\n[Deploying to Tutorial Zone: The Whispering Woods...]\n\nThe white void began to pixelate, the edges of Artie's vision dissolving into green and brown. \n\n\"Good luck, Arthur,\" Fizz muttered, her wings fluttering as she prepared for the transition. \"You're going to need it. Or better yet, try not to breathe too hard.

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nItem naming: use display_name for prose; use item_id only in JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\n\ufeffOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty

The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nsummary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\nSTATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\nmust_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\nIf state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\nEnforce scene-card durable constraints: `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\nRespect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`; avoid physical durable custody changes in non-present/non-real scope unless explicit override is present.\nReturn corrected prose plus a corrected state_patch JSON block.\n\nOutput format (required, no code fences, no commentary):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n- All *_updates arrays must contain objects; never emit bare strings as array entries.\n- character_updates.containers must be an array of objects with at least: container, owner, contents (array).\n- Durable-state mutation blocks are mandatory when applicable:\n- Required fields for durable registry entries (when creating NEW ids or filling missing required fields):\n  - item_registry_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry requires item_id and can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n    - INVALID: item_registry_updates = {\"set\": {\"ITEM_X\": {...}}}\n    - VALID: item_registry_updates = [{\"item_id\": \"ITEM_X\", \"set\": {...}}]\n  - plot_device_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry requires device_id and can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n    - INVALID: plot_device_updates = {\"set\": {\"DEVICE_X\": {...}}}\n    - VALID: plot_device_updates = [{\"device_id\": \"DEVICE_X\", \"set\": {...}}]\n\n  - item_registry_updates: set must include name, type, owner_scope, custodian, linked_threads, state_tags, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_device_id, replacement_of.\n  - plot_device_updates: set must include name, custody_scope, custody_ref, activation_state, linked_threads, constraints, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects; never an object with an `updates` field.\n- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.\n- If you mutate durable state, do not leave the same mutation only in prose.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n  - Each entry must include character_id, chapter, scene, inventory (full current list), containers (full current list), invariants_add (array), persona_updates (array).\n  - character_updates.inventory MUST be an array of objects, never string item ids.\n  - Inventory object shape: {\"item\": \"ITEM_or_name\", \"container\": \"hand_left|hand_right|<container>\", \"status\": \"held|carried|equipped|stowed\"}.\n  - Container object shape: {\"container\": \"<name>\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_id\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_id\", \"...\"]}.\n  - If you have a single persona update, still wrap it in an array of strings.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger and invariants using standard phrasing, e.g.:\n  - Avoid numeric mechanics in must_stay_true; store them in continuity system updates instead.\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> shard (carried, container=satchel)\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> longsword (carried, container=hand_right)\n  - container: satchel (owner=CHAR_example, contents=[shard, maps])\n  - milestone: shard_bind = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - milestone: maps_acquired = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - injury: right forearm scar / left arm filament\n  - ownership: shard (carried) / shard (bound but physical)\n\nIssues:\n[\n  {\n    \"code\": \"pov_drift\",\n    \"evidence\": {\n      \"excerpt\": \"\\\"Fifty points,\\\" I muttered, the words echoing in the vast, sterile whiteness...\",\n

vast, sterile whiteness of the Character Creation Void. \"Fifty points to define the rest of my digital afterlife. No pressure.\"\n\n[Available Stat Points: 50]\n\nThe translucent blue screen hummed with the faint, electronic buzz of a dying refrigerator. It hovered just out of reach, flickering every time I tried to focus on the numbers. My previous life\u2014the spreadsheets, the lukewarm coffee, the final, ignominious defeat at the hands of a Break-O-Matic 3000\u2014was a fading smudge of data. Now, I was just a guy in a grey-mesh jumpsuit that felt suspiciously like cheap polyester.\n\n\"Actually, there\u2019s a lot of pressure,\" a voice chirped. It had the clipped, manic energy of a customer service representative who had been drinking nothing but espresso and spite. \"And you\u2019re taking forever. I have three other 'accidental vending machine casualties' waiting in the queue, and two of them actually had a 401k. You\u2019re dragging down my throughput, Arthur.\"\n\nI rotated in the weightless expanse, which was a lot harder than it looked. A small, glowing sprite with neon-pink hair and a holographic clipboard was hovering three feet away. She was wearing a tiny, sharp-shouldered suit and a pair of spectacles that looked far too large for her face.\n\n\"I'm Fizz,\" she said, finally looking up from her screen to give me a look of profound disappointment. \"Your dedicated System Guide. Think of me as the person who explains why you\u2019re about to die again, but with better grammar.\"\n\n\"I died because of a bag of Cool Ranch chips, Fizz. I think we can skip the lecture on dignity.\"\n\n\"Dignity isn't a stat, unfortunately,\" Fizz said, tapping her clipboard. ITEM_FIZZ_GUIDE glowed with a soft, judgmental light in her right hand. \"Though in your case, it would have been a dump stat anyway. Now, look at the screen. We don't have all day. The System is currently calculating your base performance metrics based on your... let's call it a 'career' in data entry.\"\n\n[Character: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]\n[Class: Office Drone (Lvl 1)]\n[HP: 10/10]\n[MP: 10/10]\n[Strength: 4]\n[Agility: 3]\n[Constitution: 5]\n[Intelligence: 8]\n[Luck: 1]\n\n\"Luck: 1?\" I pointed at the screen. \"I got struck by a freak electrical surge in a breakroom. That\u2019s at least a Luck 0 event.\"\n\n\"The fact that you\u2019re even here and not just a pile of carbonized meat is a miracle of the System\u2019s mercy,\" Fizz countered, her wings buzzing with irritation. \"Now, distribute the points. Constitution is the standard recommendation for beginners. It helps you not explode when a slime looks at you funny. Or, since you spent thirty years staring at a monitor, maybe Intelligence? Not that it helped you with the vending machine.\"\n\nI stared at the numbers. They felt like a trap. If I played it safe, I\u2019d just be a slightly more durable version of the guy who died for a snack. I looked past the primary stats, searching for something else. Down at the very bottom of the menu, obscured by a flickering line of dead pixels, was a stat that didn't have a label.\n\n\"What's this one?\" I asked, pointing to the glitching bar.\n\nFizz squinted, her glasses sliding down her nose. \"That? Oh, that\u2019s just a legacy overflow from the combat engine. It\u2019s supposed to be 'Critical Hit Rate,' but it\u2019s hard-capped for your level. You shouldn't even be able to see it. It\u2019s basically a bug. Move on.\"\n\n\"A bug?\" I felt a familiar spark of corporate rebellion. \"You mean it\u2019s an exploit?\"\n\n\"It\u2019s a non-functional variable, Arthur. If you put points into it, you\u2019re essentially throwing them into the trash. Like your degree in Liberal Arts.\"\n\nI looked at the 50 points. Then I looked at my 10 HP. If I put all 50 into Constitution, I might have 60 HP. In a world of monsters and magic, 60 HP was still just a one-shot waiting to happen. But if I could hit... really, really hard...\n\n\"You know,\" I said, my finger hovering over the glitched bar. \"In my old job, whenever the software glitched, we didn't fix it. We just called it a feature and charged the client double.\"\n\n\"Don't you dare,\" Fizz warned, her voice dropping an octave. \"If you mess with the ratio, the System\u2019s auto-balancer will kick in. It has to maintain parity. You increase your offensive output that much, and it\u2019ll strip your survivability to compensate. You'll be a glass cannon without the cannon part. Just a glass... thing. A glass vase. Easy to break and useless in a fight.\"\n\n\"I've spent my whole life being a 'beginner,'\" I muttered. \"Let's see what happens when the math breaks.\"\n\nI slammed my hand against the screen, dragging the slider for the glitched stat all the way to the right. \n\n[Warning: Stat Allocation exceeds recommended thresholds for Level 1.]\n[Warning: System Parity Error. Compensating...]\n[Warning: Logic Loop detected. Critical Hit Rate cannot exceed 100% at current rank.]\n\n\"Arthur, stop!\" Fizz shouted, dropping her clipboard as she lunged for the screen.\n\nI didn't stop. I dumped all 50 points. The blue screen turned a violent, bleeding red. The numbers began to spin, blurring into a mess of illegible symbols before snapping into place with a sound like a gunshot.\n\n[Stat Allocation Confirmed.]\n[Calculating adjustments...]\n\nThe grey-mesh jumpsuit tightened around me, vibrating with a strange, humming energy. I felt lighter. Too light. Like I was made of paper.\n\n[Character: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]\n[Class: Statistical Anomaly (Lvl 1)]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Strength: 1]\n[Agility: 1]\n[Constitution: 1]\n[Intelligence: 1]\n[Crit Rate: 100% (LOCKED)]\n\n\"One HP?\" I whispered, staring at the single, lonely digit. \"I have one hit point?\"\n\nFizz was staring at the screen, her mouth hanging open. She slowly reached out and picked up her clipboard, her hand shaking.\n\n\"You idiot,\" she breathed. \"You absolute, unmitigated moron. You just traded your entire existence for a guaranteed crit. You have 1 HP. Do you know what that means? A stiff breeze could kill you. A sneeze would be a boss fight. If you stub your toe, you\u2019re deleted!\"\n\n\"But I\u2019ll never miss a crit,\" I said, trying to sound more confident than I felt. My heart\u2014which I could now feel beating with terrifying clarity against my ribs\u2014thudded once.\n\n[System Notification: Build 'Crit or Quit' has been finalized.]\n[Title Gained: Glassest of Cannons]\n[Description: You have 1 HP and 100% Crit Rate. You are a mathematical impossibility. The System hates you, but it\u2019s impressed by your audacity.]\n\n\"Finalized?\" I asked. \"Wait, can I re-spec?\"\n\n\"No,\" Fizz said, her voice trembling with a mix of horror and hysterical laughter. \"The System just locked the build. You\u2019re a glitch, Arthur. A walking, talking error message. And I\u2019m the one who has to guide you through a tutorial zone where the local wildlife has more health than a god, but you... you're a paper plate in a hurricane.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, looking down at my translucent, fragile-looking hands. \"At least I won't have to worry about a long-term retirement plan anymore.\"\n\n[Initialization Complete.]\n[Deploying to Tutorial Zone: The Whispering Woods...]\n\nThe white void began to pixelate, the edges of my vision dissolving into green and brown. \n\n\"Good luck, Arthur,\" Fizz muttered, her wings fluttering as she prepared for the transition. \"You're going to need it. Or better yet, try not to breathe too hard. You might lose half your health.\"\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"characters\": {\n    \"count\": 5,\n    \"status\": \"READY\",\n    \"updated_at\": \"2026-02-10T06:59:26Z\"\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 2\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"global_continuity_system_state\": {},\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_001/scene_002.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"DRAFTING\",\n  \"summary\": {\n    \"chapter_so_far\": [\n      \"Artie died in an office breakroom accident and entered the System's Character Creation Void.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_facts_ring\": [\n      \"Artie argued with a 'Break-O-Matic 3000' vending machine over a stuck bag of chips.\",\n      \"Artie kicked the machine, triggering a massive electrical surge.\",\n      \"The System registered a 'Critical Hit' of -12 HP, reducing Artie's health to 0.\",\n      \"Artie's physical form and mundane items (wallet, change, tie) dissolved into data.\",\n      \"Artie arrived in the Character Creation Void and was greeted by a System Notification.\",\n      \"The System began calculating Artie's base stats based on his previous life performance.\",\n      \"milestone: death_event = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: void_entry = DONE\",\n      \"location: Character Creation Void\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Leather Wallet (lost)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Loose Change (lost)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Silk Tie (lost)\"\n    ],\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie attempted to buy chips from a vending machine in his office breakroom.
