Behind him, the low-poly snarls of a pack of Mangy Coyotes faded into the distance, but the air around him still hummed with the sickly, neon-green throb of the Aggro Aura.\n\nIn his left hand, the Participation Trophy (Tutorial Edition) pulsed like a radioactive heart. In his right, the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) felt less like a weapon and more like a lightning rod for bad luck.\n\n\"Almost... there...\" Artie wheezed. His stamina bar was a flickering sliver of yellow, hovering dangerously close to the 'Exhausted' debuff.\n\n\"Pick up the pace, Artie! You\u2019re running like a man who hasn't seen a gym since the Clinton administration,\" Fizz chirped, hovering effortlessly beside his head. She was upside down, lazily spinning in the air while checking a translucent scroll. \"Also, you\u2019re trailing a very angry Level 5 Coyote. It\u2019s about thirty meters back and looks like it hasn't had breakfast. Or a bath. Ever.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m... doing... my... best!\" Artie managed to choke out. \n\nThe gates of Oakhaven finally loomed ahead\u2014massive, iron-banded timber walls that promised the sweet, sweet safety of a non-combat zone. Two guards stood under the shadow of the archway, leaning on halberds with the practiced apathy of men who had seen too many level-one idiots die in the dirt.\n\nAs Artie stumbled into the 'Scanner Range' marked by a faint blue line on the road, he heard the guards talking. They weren't reaching for their weapons. They were reaching for small, leather-bound ledgers.\n\n\"Told you,\" the guard on the left said, squinting through a visor. He had a nameplate that read [Guard Hovis - Lvl 15]. \"Look at the gait. That\u2019s a sub-five Agility if I ever saw one. Five silver says he trips before the line.\"\n\nThe second guard, [Guard Barnaby - Lvl 14], snorted. \"No way. Look at the panic. That\u2019s a 'Fear' buff if I\u2019ve ever seen it. Fear gives a hidden +2 to sprint speed. I\u2019ll take that bet, and I\u2019ll raise you another five that his Vitality is so low he\u2019s practically a ghost already.\"\n\n\"Hey!\" Artie yelled, his voice cracking. \"A little help? Monster? Behind me?\"\n\nHovis didn't even look up from his ledger. \"Processing is at the gate, kid. Stay in the lane. If you die before the scanner hits you, the bet\u2019s a wash, Barnaby.\"\n\nArtie reached the blue line, his heart hammering against his ribs\u2014a sensation that, in this world, felt like a literal countdown to a Game Over.\n\n[System Notification: Entering Oakhaven Scanning Perimeter. Please remain still for Stat Validation.]\n\n\"Still?\" Artie screamed, glancing over his shoulder. The Mangy Coyote was visible now, a blur of grey fur and yellow teeth, kicking up a cloud of dust as it accelerated. The Aggro Aura on the trophy in Artie's left hand flared bright green, practically screaming *Eat Me* to the local wildlife. \"I can't remain still! There is a literal apex predator trying to turn me into a statistic!\"\n\n\"Statistically speaking,\" Fizz said, popping a piece of spectral bubblegum, \"you already are one.\"\n\nA shimmering curtain of light descended from the archway. It was a pale, clinical blue that smelled faintly of ozone and old library books. As Artie crossed the threshold, the light hit him, and for a second, time seemed to stutter.\n\nThe scanner didn't just beep. It groaned.\n\n[Scanning...]\n[Name: Arthur Penhaligon]\n[Level: 2]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Critical Hit Rate: 100%]\n\nThe blue light turned a violent, strobe-light red. A siren, high-pitched and dissonant like a dial-up modem screaming in agony, erupted from the gatehouse.\n\n[WARNING: STATISTICAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\n[DATA CORRUPTION SUSPECTED: VALUE 'HP' OUTSIDE STANDARD DEVIATION]\n[DATA CORRUPTION SUSPECTED: VALUE 'CRIT_RATE' EXCEEDS SYSTEM CAPS]\n\nHovis and Barnaby both jumped, their ledgers flying into the dirt. \n\n\"What the hell?\" Barnaby shouted, shielding his eyes. \"Is the machine breaking? I\u2019ve never heard the 'Anomaly' siren before. Not since that guy tried to smuggle a Bag of Holding inside another Bag of Holding.\"\n\n\"Look at the readout!\" Hovis pointed to a floating display above the gate. \n\nThe display was flickering, trying to render Artie's stats for the public record, but the numbers were spinning so fast they looked like a blur of static. Then, the text settled into a jagged, pixelated font:\n\n[SUBJECT: ARTIE]\n[THREAT LEVEL: UNKNOWN / PATHETIC]\n[STATUS: 1 HP / 100% CRIT]\n[SYSTEM NOTE: How are you even alive?]\n\n\"One HP?\" Hovis whispered, his jaw dropping. \"Barnaby, you owe me ten silver. That\u2019s not just low Vitality, that\u2019s... that\u2019s a rounding error.\"\n\n\"Forget the silver!\" Barnaby yelled, pointing past Artie. \"Look at what he brought with him!\"\n\nThe Level 5 Mangy Coyote hit the scanning perimeter at full tilt. Normally, a wild animal would avoid the scent of civilization, but the Participation Trophy\u2019s aura was an irresistible siren song of pure, concentrated hatred. The coyote didn't even slow down; it lunged, its eyes fixed on the glowing trophy in Artie's left hand.\n\n\"Panic!\" Artie yelled, which was less of a tactical command and more of a lifestyle choice. He swung his right hand wildly, the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) whistling through the air.\n\nHe didn't hit the coyote. He hit the air *near* the coyote. \n\n[Critical Hit! - 0 Damage (Prop Weapon Penalty)]\n[System Note: You successfully critted the atmosphere. The air molecules are very upset.]\n\nThe shockwave of the 'Air-Crit' didn't hurt the monster, but the sheer mathematical impossibility of the hit caused a localized vacuum. The coyote\u2019s lunge was jerked six inches to the left, its teeth snapping shut on empty air just centimeters from Artie's throat.\n\n\"Help! Guards! Do your jobs!\" Artie scrambled backward, tripping over his own feet and falling flat on his ass.\n\n[HP: 1/1]\n[System Notification: Falling damage negated due to 'Pathetic Grace' hidden modifier. You are too light to impact the ground with force.]\n\n\"The kid's a virus!\" Barnaby shouted, finally drawing a heavy iron mace. \"Hovis, help me clear the aggro before the scanner explodes!\"\n\nHovis leveled his halberd and stepped forward with a sigh. \"This is going to be so much paperwork. I hate anomalies.\"\n\nWith a practiced thrust, Hovis drove the halberd into the coyote\u2019s flank. The beast yelped, its focus finally breaking from the trophy as the guard\u2019s superior level and stats took over. Barnaby followed up with a crushing blow from his mace, turning the Level 5 threat into a heap of dissolving pixels in seconds.\n\n[Combat Ended]\n[Experience Shared: 0 (Subject did not contribute meaningful damage)]\n[System Note: Flailing is not a combat style.]\n\nArtie sat in the dirt, clutching the trophy to his chest, his breath coming in ragged gasps. The red strobe light of the scanner was still pulsing, casting long, rhythmic shadows against the gate.\n\n\"You,\" Hovis said, walking over and looming over Artie. He poked Artie\u2019s shoulder with the blunt end of his halberd. \"Don't move. I need to see if you\u2019re going to pop.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to pop,\" Artie snapped, though he wasn't entirely sure. \"I'm just... efficient. I put all my points into the good stuff.\"\n\n\"Kid, you put all your points into a death wish,\" Barnaby said, shaking his head as he picked up his ledger. \"One HP? A sneeze would send you back to the respawn shrine. And we don't even have a respawn shrine in Oakhaven. It's under renovation.\"\n\n\"Wait, what?\" Artie looked up, his face paling. \"No respawn? Then where do people go when they die?\"\n\n\"Usually into a very small box,\" Fizz said, appearing on Artie's shoulder and patting his cheek. \"But don't worry! I'm sure your '100% Crit' rate will protect you from the crushing reality of permanent deletion. Probably.\"\n\nThe siren finally died down, replaced by a low, rhythmic thumping sound from the gatehouse. A small slot opened in the stone wall, and a wooden token clattered out, landing in the dirt next to Artie. \n\nThe token was bright orange and had a large, black 'A' stamped on it.\n\n\"Pick it up,\" Hovis commanded.\n\nArtie reached out and grabbed the token.\n\n[Item Acquired: Anomaly ID Tag]\n[Type: Quest Item / Mark of Shame]\n[Description: You are officially a Statistical Anomaly. This tag alerts all town NPCs that your existence is a bug in the System. Expect higher prices, deeper suspicion, and frequent 'Safety Checks' from local authorities.]\n\n\"Great,\" Artie muttered, pushing himself to his feet. He dusted off his jeans, though the 'Participation Trophy' in his left hand continued to hum with a faint, lingering green light. \"Is there a 'I\u2019m Just a Victim of Circumstance' tag I can trade this for?\"\n\n\"Move it along, Anomaly,\" Barnaby said, gesturing toward the town square beyond the gate. \"The Mayor's going to want to hear about you. We haven't had a 1 HP build since 'The Great Math Collapse' of '04, and that guy died because he sat on a particularly sharp piece of cheese.\"\n\n\"I'll be careful with the dairy,\" Artie said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \n\nHe started walking, his legs still shaking. As he passed through the archway, he felt the heavy gaze of the guards on his back. They weren't betting on his stats anymore; they were watching him like a bomb that might go off at any second.\n\n\"So,\" Fizz said, zipping ahead of him into the bustling streets of Oakhaven. \"First stop: the tavern? Or should we go straight to the blacksmith and see if he can turn that 'Prop' sword into something that actually kills things instead of just offending the laws of physics?\"\n\nArtie looked down at the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) in his right hand. The blade was chipped, the hilt was loose, and it was currently his only hope of survival in a world where a stiff breeze was a boss fight.\n\n\"Tavern,\" Artie said firmly. \"I need a drink. And I need to find a way to get rid of this trophy before it attracts a dragon or a very aggressive squirrel.\"\n\n\"Good luck with that,\" Fizz laughed. \"Cursed items are like bad reputations\u2014they\u2019re really hard to scrub off.\"\n\nArtie stepped into Oakhaven, the 'Anomaly' tag swinging from his belt, a Level 2 glitch in a world governed by hard numbers.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"CHAR_FIZZ\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"Oakhaven Town

And I need to find a way to get rid of this trophy before it attracts a dragon or a very aggressive squirrel.\"\n\n\"Good luck with that,\" Fizz laughed. \"Cursed items are like bad reputations\u2014they\u2019re really hard to scrub off.\"\n\nArtie stepped into Oakhaven, the 'Anomaly' tag swinging from his belt, a Level 2 glitch in a world governed by hard

You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the RNG-Hellscape\",\"goal\":\"Introduce Artie and his

with the rhythmic intensity of a subwoofer in a teenager\u2019s trunk. I checked the floating red bar hovering above its translucent, jiggly head. \n\n[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 3] [HP: 45/45]\n\nForty-five health. At my current Strength of 12, with a base weapon damage of 4-6, I was looking at a nine-hit kill minimum, assuming the RNG gods didn't decide to spit on my shoes today. \n\n\"You know,\" I said, adjusting my grip on the rusted shortsword. \"In most worlds, puddles are for stepping in, not for getting dissolved by.\"\n\nThe slime responded by launching a glob of corrosive mucus. I rolled left, the grass staining my knees.\n\n[Stamina: 88/100]\n\n\"Missed me. Barely. That\u2019s a three-second cooldown on your spit, isn't it?\"\n\nI didn't wait for the confirmation. I lunged. The blade sank into the gelatinous mass with a sound like a heavy boot pulling out of thick mud.\n\n[Critical Hit! -14 HP]\n\n\"There we go. Who needs luck when you have math?\"\n\nThe slime shuddered, its HP bar dipping into the yellow. \n\n[HP: 31/45]\n\n\"One more of those and we can talk about your retirement plan,\" I muttered. My lungs burned slightly, a reminder that my Agility was still garbage. \n\n[Passive Skill Gained: Basic Analysis (Rank F)]\n[Description: You can see basic stats and cooldowns of enemies within 5 meters. You\u2019ve stopped guessing and started counting. Good for you.]\n\n\"Finally,\" I breathed, dodging another glob. \"The ding is coming. I can practically taste the experience points. They taste like copper and bad decisions.\" \n\nI swung again, the numbers popping in the air like neon confetti. This wasn't just a fight; it was a grind.
