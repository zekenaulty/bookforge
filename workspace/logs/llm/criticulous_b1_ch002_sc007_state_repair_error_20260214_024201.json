  "prompt": {
    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nUI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says \"always include\".\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it unless explicitly removing a stale fact with REMOVE and restating the current truth.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v2\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}]\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the

You must output a corrected STATE_PATCH JSON only.\nNo prose, no commentary, no code fences.\n\nGoal:\n- Ensure state_patch fully and accurately captures the scene's events and outcomes.\n- Fill missing summary_update data and fix invalid formats from draft_patch.\n- Preserve pre-scene invariants unless this scene changes them; when it does, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n  - If this scene changes a durable fact (stats/HP/status/title/custody), you MUST update must_stay_true to reflect the final end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove or replace any prior must_stay_true entries that conflict with new durable values.\n  - Do NOT carry forward conflicting legacy invariants once the scene updates them.\n\n- must_stay_true removal (mandatory when a durable fact is superseded):\n  - Add \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" in summary_update.must_stay_true.\n  - Place REMOVE lines before the new final invariant.\n  - REMOVE lines also apply to key_facts_ring (purge stale facts from continuity).\n\n- Ensure mechanic/UI ownership in continuity system updates.\n\nRules:\n- Output a single JSON object that matches the state_patch schema.\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for world_updates.cast_present.\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for world_updates.open_threads.\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- summary_update arrays are required: last_scene (2-4 sentences), key_events (3-7 bullets), must_stay_true (3-7 bullets), chapter_so_far_add (bullets).\n- Continuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- UI gate: only include bracketed UI blocks when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If false, remove or rephrase UI blocks into narrative prose.\n\n- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.\n- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.\n- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.\n- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene..\n- titles are arrays of objects with stable name fields; do not emit titles as plain strings.\n- Canonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\n- If item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for authoritative labels and custody terms.\n- Use item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If prose depicts a durable appearance change, include character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- Do NOT set summary or art text in appearance_updates (derived after acceptance).\n\nNaming repairs:\n- If lint flags an item naming issue, fix it with minimal edits.\n- Do not remove humor; simply anchor the item (add display_name near first mention) and ensure custody-change sentences include the display_name.\n- Do not rename item_id or registry fields; only adjust prose wording.\n- Do not add numeric mechanics to invariants_add; store them in continuity system updates instead.\n- If an event appears in prose, it must appear in key_events.\n- must_stay_true must include milestone ledger entries and any inventory/injury/ownership invariants implied by prose.\n- Inventory posture reconciliation:\n  - If inventory/containers change (held/stowed/container), must_stay_true must be updated to the final posture.\n  - Add REMOVE lines for prior inventory/container invariants before the new final entries.\n  - Use canonical invariant formats:\n    - inventory: CHAR_X -> <item display_name> (status=held|carried|equipped|stowed, container=hand_left|hand_right|<container>)\n    - container: <container> (owner=CHAR_X, contents=[<item display_name>, ...])\n- character_updates entries must use arrays: persona_updates (array), invariants_add (array).\n- character_updates.inventory must be an array of objects, never item-id strings.\n- Inventory object shape: {\"item\": \"ITEM_or_name\", \"container\": \"hand_left|hand_right|<container>\", \"status\": \"held|carried|equipped|stowed\"}.\n  - Container object shape: {\"container\": \"<name>\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_id\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_id\", \"...\"]}.\n- Use character_continuity_system_updates / global_continuity_system_updates to reconcile mechanics.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects.

Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n\n- Transfer vs registry conflict rule (must follow):\n  - If you create a NEW item in item_registry_updates with final custodian already set (e.g., CHAR_ARTIE), DO NOT emit transfer_updates for that item.\n  - If you emit transfer_updates for a NEW item, the registry entry must start with custodian=\"world\" and then transfer to the character.\n  - expected_before must match the registry entry at the moment of transfer (after any registry update that applies before it).  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects;

optional `required_visible_on_page`).\n- Respect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`; avoid physical custody changes in non-present/non-real scope unless explicit override is present.\n\n- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):\n  - If timeline_scope != \"present\" OR ontological_scope != \"real\", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).\n  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.\n  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category=\"timeline_override\".\n\nInputs\n- prose: final scene text\n- state: pre-scene state\n- draft_patch: patch returned by write/repair (may be incomplete)\n- continuity_pack: pre-write continuity pack\n- character_states: current cast-only character state\n\nScene card:\n{\n  \"cast_present\": [\n    \"Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon\",\n    \"Vane\"\n  ],\n  \"cast_present_ids\": [\n    \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n    \"CHAR_VANE\"\n  ],\n  \"chapter\": 2,\n  \"conflict\": \"Artie must stay hidden in a sarcophagus despite his neon-glowing cloak and 100% Aggro Meter.\",\n  \"constraints\": [\n    \"target_words: 2000\",\n    \"Artie must remain inside a sarcophagus for the majority of the scene\",\n    \"Vane's party must demonstrate high-level efficiency\",\n    \"The neon glow of the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion must be a tactical liability\"\n  ],\n  \"continuity_system_focus\": [\n    \"aggro_meter\",\n    \"stats\",\n    \"resources\"\n  ],\n  \"device_presence\": [],\n  \"end_condition\": \"Vane's party moves deeper into the crypts, leaving Artie alone and shaken.\",\n  \"forbidden_visible\": [],\n  \"goal\": \"Contrast Artie's glitchy, desperate survival with Vane's legitimate, overwhelming power.\",\n  \"introduces\": [],\n  \"introduces_ids\": [],\n  \"ontological_scope\": \"real\",\n  \"required_callbacks\": [\n    \"milestone: loot_glitch_discovered\",\n    \"milestone: skeleton_archer_defeated\"\n  ],\n  \"required_in_custody\": [\n    \"ITEM_PARTICIPATION_TROPHY\",\n    \"ITEM_CLOAK_COWARDLY_LION\",\n    \"ITEM_ID_BADGE\",\n    \"ITEM_SMARTPHONE\"\n  ],\n  \"required_scene_accessible\": [\n    \"ITEM_ANCIENT_COPPER_COINS\",\n    \"ITEM_CALCIUM_SUPPLEMENT\"\n  ],\n  \"required_visible_on_page\": [\n    \"ITEM_CLOAK_COWARDLY_LION\"\n  ],\n  \"scene\": 7,\n  \"scene_id\": \"SC_002_007\",\n  \"scene_target\": \"Artie witnesses Vane's party clearing the crypt and realizes the massive power gap.\",\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.1\",\n  \"thread_ids\": [],\n  \"timeline_scope\": \"present\",\n  \"transition_type\": \"escalation\",\n  \"ui_allowed\": true,\n  \"ui_mechanics_expected\": [\n    \"Aggro Meter\",\n    \"HP\",\n    \"Level\",\n    \"System Notification\"\n  ]\n}\n\nContinuity pack:\n{\n  \"cast_present\": [\n    \"Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon\",\n    \"Vane\"\n  ],\n  \"constraints\": [\n    \"Artie is Level 2 with 1/1 HP, 100% Crit Rate, 50 Evasion, and 100% Aggro (Critical Density).\",\n    \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Participation Trophy (status=held, container=hand_left, soul-bound=TRUE)\",\n    \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Cloak of the Cowardly Lion (status=equipped, container=back)\",\n    \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Corporate ID Badge (status=equipped, container=neck)\",\n    \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Cracked Smartphone (status=stowed, container=pocket_right)\",\n    \"Artie is under the 'Coward's Shame' and 'Coward's Sprint' statuses.\",\n    \"aggro_meter: 100\",\n    \"Artie must remain inside a sarcophagus for the majority of the scene.\",\n    \"The neon glow of the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion must be a tactical liability.\"\n  ],\n  \"location\": \"Low-Level Crypts\",\n  \"next_action\": \"Artie attempts to remain undetected inside a sarcophagus while Vane's party clears the surrounding chamber.\",\n  \"open_threads\": [\n    \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\",\n    \"THREAD_VANE_RIVALRY\",\n    \"THREAD_SYSTEM_GLITCH\"\n  ],\n  \"scene_end_anchor\": \"Artie defeated a Level 4 Skeleton Archer with a single critical punch, triggering a Damage Calculation Overflow.

fit perfectly, which was both a blessing for Artie\u2019s oxygen levels and a death sentence for his stealth. Through the half-inch gap of ancient granite, the world was a narrow horizontal slice of flickering torchlight and damp shadows. \n\nIt was also screamingly, aggressively yellow.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 100% (Critical Density)] (Warning: High Visibility detected)\n\nArtie squeezed his eyes shut, trying to wish away the garish radiance leaking from the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion. The garment didn't just provide evasion; it provided the kind of luminescence usually reserved for radioactive waste or poorly themed bowling alleys. He clutched the Participation Trophy against his chest with his left hand, the cold metal of the cursed award doing nothing to dampen the 100% Aggro pulse thrumming through his veins.\n\n\"Clear left,\" a voice boomed, vibrating the very stone Artie was hiding in. It was a voice like a tectonic plate having a bad day.\n\nArtie peered through the crack. A pair of boots, polished to a mirror finish and crafted from obsidian-black steel, stepped into his narrow field of vision. This was Vane. The man didn't walk; he conquered the floor.\n\n[Vane - Lvl 45] [HP: 500/500]\n\nArtie\u2019s breath hitched. He was Level 2. He had 1 HP. If Vane so much as sneezed in the direction of this sarcophagus, Artie would be reduced to a very confused ghost.\n\n\"Nothing but dust and low-level scrap, Vane,\" another voice said\u2014a woman, sounding bored. \"The 'Anomaly' scanner picked up a spike here, but it\u2019s probably just a ghost-glitch. This wing is a graveyard for a reason.\"\n\n\"The System doesn't spike for 'probably,'\" Vane replied. He shifted his weight, and the hum of a high-level weapon filled the room. Artie saw the tip of the Obsidian Greatsword, a blade so dark it seemed to suck the light out of the air\u2014except for the neon yellow light.\n\nA stray beam of Artie\u2019s cloak hit the edge of Vane\u2019s greave.\n\nArtie froze. His heart hammered against his ribs like a trapped bird.\n\n[Stamina: 60/100] (Stress Penalty Applied)\n\n\"Wait,\" Vane said, his voice dropping to a low, dangerous register. \n\nArtie watched through the crack as Vane turned. The tall warrior\u2019s athletic build was encased in plate armor that looked like it cost more than Artie\u2019s entire previous life\u2019s salary. Vane leaned down, his steely grey eyes narrowing as he scanned the base of the sarcophagus. The rank tattoo on his left temple seemed to pulse with a faint, threatening light.\n\n\"There\u2019s a glow,\" Vane muttered. He raised the Obsidian Greatsword.\n\n\"Vane! Boss-room trigger just went off in the South Hall!\" the woman shouted from the corridor. \"If we don't move now, the loot-lock engages!\"\n\nVane paused. The blade hovered inches from the stone lid. Artie could see the microscopic chips in the granite. He could smell the ozone coming off the legendary weapon.\n\n\"Efficiency first,\" Vane grunted. He stood up, the movement fluid and terrifyingly fast. \"We\u2019ll sweep the 'Anomaly' on the way back. If it\u2019s a player, they\u2019re already dead. Nothing survives this much Aggro Density at this level.\"\n\nThe heavy clatter of armored boots receded, followed by the rhythmic chanting of a high-level haste spell. The room plunged back into a relative silence, save for the hum of Artie\u2019s own terror and the soft, mocking glow of his neon cloak.\n\nArtie didn't move. He didn't even breathe until the [Aggro Meter] dipped to a pulsing 98%. He was alone in the dark, clutching a trophy he couldn't drop, wearing a cloak that made him a target, and realizing that in the eyes of the System\u2019s elite, he wasn't even a threat. \n\nHe was just a glitch waiting to be patched out.\n\nItem registry (canonical):\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"custodian\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"derived_access_reason\": \"custodian_in_cast\",\n      \"derived_scene_accessible\": true,\n      \"derived_visible\": true,\n      \"display_name\": \"Ancient Copper Coin\",\n      \"item_id\": \"ITEM_ANCIENT_COPPER_COINS\",\n      \"last_seen\": {\n        \"chapter\": 2,\n        \"location\": \"Low-Level Crypts\",\n        \"scene\": 6\n      },\n      \"linked_threads\": [\n        \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"\n      ],\n      \"name\": \"Ancient Copper Coins\",\n      \"owner_scope\": \"character\",\n      \"state_tags\": [\n        \"loot\",\n        \"currency\"\n      ],\n      \"type\": \"currency\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"custodian\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"derived_access_reason\": \"custodian_in_cast\",\n      \"derived_scene_accessible\": true,\n      \"derived_visible\": true,\n      \"display_name\": \"'Almost-Legendary' Calcium Supplement\",\n      \"item_id\": \"ITEM_CALCIUM_SUPPLEMENT\",\n      \"last_seen\": {\n        \"chapter\": 2,\n        \"location\": \"Low-Level Crypts\",\n        \"scene\": 6\n      },\n      \"linked_threads\": [\n        \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"\n      ],\n      \"name\": \"Almost-Legendary Calcium Supplement\",\n      \"owner_scope\": \"character\",\n      \"state_tags\": [\n        \"loot\",\n        \"glitched\"\n      ],\n      \"type\": \"consumable\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"aliases\": [\n        \"neon yellow cloak\",\n        \"coward's cloak\"\n      ],\n      \"custodian\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"derived_access_reason\": \"custodian_in_cast\",\n      \"derived_scene_accessible\": true,\n      \"derived_visible\": true,\n      \"display_name\": \"Cloak of the Cowardly Lion\",\n      \"item_id\": \"ITEM_CLOAK_COWARDLY_LION\",\n      \"last_seen\": {\n        \"chapter\": 2,\n        \"location\": \"Low-Level Crypts\",\n        \"scene\": 5\n      },\n      \"linked_threads\": [\n        \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"\n      ],\n      \"name\": \"Cloak of the Cowardly Lion\",\n      \"owner_scope\": \"character\",\n      \"state_tags\": [\n        \"high_evasion\",\n        \"dignity_penalty\",\n        \"neon_yellow\",\n        \"quest_item\"\n      ],\n      \"type\": \"armor\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"custodian\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"derived_access_reason\": \"custodian_in_cast\",\n      \"derived_scene_accessible\": true,\n      \"derived_visible\": true,\n      \"display_name\": \"Corporate ID Badge\",\n      \"item_id\": \"ITEM_ID_BADGE\",\n      \"last_seen\": {\n        \"chapter\": 2,\n        \"location\": \"Low-Level Crypts\",\n        \"scene\": 5\n      },\n      \"linked_threads\": [],\n      \"name\": \"Corporate ID Badge\",\n      \"owner_scope\": \"character\",\n      \"state_tags\": [\n        \"mundane\"\n      ],\n      \"type\": \"accessory\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"custodian\": \"CHAR_VANE\",\n      \"derived_access_reason\": \"custodian_in_cast\",\n      \"derived_scene_accessible\": true,\n      \"derived_visible\": true,\n      \"display_name\": \"Obsidian Greatsword\",\n      \"item_id\": \"ITEM_OBSIDIAN_BLADE\",\n      \"last_seen\": {\n        \"chapter\": 1,\n        \"location\": \"Oakhaven -
