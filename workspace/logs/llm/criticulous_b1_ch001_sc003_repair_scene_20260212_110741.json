One moment, Artie Penhaligon was standing in a vacuum of pure potential; the next, his boots hit damp soil with a squelch that vibrated all the way up his lanky frame. \n\nThe air was thick with the scent of pine needles and something suspiciously like ozone. High above, the canopy of the Whispering Woods didn't just sway; it pulsed. The leaves were a vibrant, oversaturated green that hurt to look at for too long, shimmering with a faint, low-resolution haze.\n\n[Location: Whispering Woods - Tutorial Zone]\n[Safety Rating: Low (Newbie-Friendlyish)]\n\n\"Welcome to the grind, Artie!\" Fizz chirped, her neon pink hair leaving a trail of magenta sparks as she zipped in a tight circle around his head. Her pixelated wings hummed like a high-end drone. \"Try not to breathe too deep. The atmospheric rendering is still a bit buggy in this sector.\"\n\nArtie didn't respond. He was too busy staring at the corner of his vision, where a tiny, pathetic red bar sat like a ticking time bomb.\n\n[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon - Lvl 1]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Crit Rate: 100%]\n[Status: Glitched (Crit-Only)]\n\n\"One,\" Artie whispered, his voice cracking. \"Fizz, it really says one. I thought maybe... once we spawned in, the System would round up? Or give me a 'Pity Shield'? Or literally anything other than a single point of structural integrity?\"\n\nFizz hovered at eye level, her glowing violet eyes scanning him with a mix of pity and professional detachment. She reached toward the satchel hanging at her side, though she didn't pull anything out yet. \"I checked the manual, Artie. 'The Noob's Guide to Not Dying' is very clear on this. Page four hundred and twelve: 'A character with one hit point is technically alive, which is the preferred state for beginning a quest.' It doesn't say anything about it being a *good* idea.\"\n\n\"Technically alive is the worst kind of alive,\" Artie muttered. He looked down at his hands. They were empty. No sword, no shield, not even a sturdy stick. Just his pale, lanky fingers and a growing sense of existential dread. \"Where's the starter gear? Don't I get a rusted spoon or a damp rag to defend myself with?\"\n\n\"Tutorial gear spawns at the first Milestone Marker,\" Fizz explained, pointing a tiny, iridescent finger toward a clearing ahead. \"But honestly, with your build, a shield would just be a very expensive way to die in one hit while carrying something heavy. You\u2019re a 'Statistical Anomaly,' remember? You\u2019re not supposed to block. You\u2019re supposed to... well, not get hit.\"\n\nArtie stepped forward, his movements cautious and jerky. Every twig that snapped under his boots sounded like a gunshot. Every rustle in the undergrowth made him flinch so hard he nearly tripped over his own feet. In any other game, this would be the peaceful intro\u2014the part where the music is jaunty and the worst thing that can happen is a stray butterfly. Here, a butterfly landing on his shoulder might actually be a game-over event.\n\nThe woods began to live up to their name. A soft, multi-tonal murmuring rose from the trees, a thousand overlapping voices whispering things that sounded like \"Fresh data\" and \"Low defense detected.\" \n\n\"Is the forest talking about my lack of armor?\" Artie asked, his heart hammering against his ribs.\n\n\"It\u2019s just environmental flavor text,\" Fizz said, though she sounded slightly less confident as she glanced at a particularly gnarled oak. \"Mostly. Just keep moving. The first quest NPC is just\u2014\"\n\nShe stopped. The humming of her wings shifted to a higher, sharper pitch.\n\nFrom behind a cluster of glowing blue mushrooms, something wobbled into the light. It was translucent, a sickly shade of neon green, and it jiggled with the rhythmic intensity of a subwoofer. It was the quintessential RPG starter mob: a slime.\n\n[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 1]\n[HP: 10/10]\n\n\"Oh, thank god,\" Artie breathed, leaning forward slightly. \"It\u2019s just a slime. It\u2019s a literal puddle of jelly. I can handle a puddle.\"\n\nThe slime didn't just wobble; it surged. It moved with a surprising, fluid speed, leaving a trail of corrosive-looking slime on the grass. As it approached, a small UI window flickered into existence next to its nameplate.\n\n[Combat Estimate: Lethal]\n[Estimated Damage to Player: 2-4]\n[Player HP: 1]\n\nArtie\u2019s blood turned to ice. \"Fizz. Fizz, the math. Look at the math.\"\n\n\"I see it!\" Fizz squeaked, her hand diving into her satchel to pat the cover of The Noob's Guide to Not Dying as if for luck. \"The minimum damage floor for a Level 1 Slime is two! It doesn't matter if it just grazes your pinky toe, Artie! It\u2019s going to do double your total health!\"\n\nThe slime reared back, its gelatinous body stretching upward until it was nearly three feet tall. It didn't have eyes, but Artie could feel its mindless, hungry focus. It lunged.\n\nArtie scrambled backward, his heels catching on a protruding root. He fell, hitting the ground with a thud that sent a jarring shock through his spine. \n\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Warning: Physical trauma detected. Any further impact will result in Deletion.]\n\nHe scrambled on his hands and knees, dragging himself away as the slime landed exactly where his chest had been a second ago. The grass hissed and withered where the creature touched it. \n\n\"Run! Artie, use your legs!\" Fizz shouted, darting around the slime\u2019s head to distract it. \"It\u2019s a tutorial mob! Its pathfinding should be terrible!\"\n\nArtie scrambled to his feet and bolted toward a dense thicket of thorns, but the slime was relentless. It wasn't just hopping; it was flowing, molding itself to the terrain with terrifying efficiency. He ducked under a low-hanging branch, his messy brown hair catching on the bark, and veered left into a narrow rocky crevice.\n\nHe realized his mistake the moment his back hit the cold, damp stone. \n\nThe crevice was a dead end. The walls rose high on three sides, slick with moss and jagged edges. He turned, his breath coming in ragged, panicked gasps, to see the neon green mass of the slime filling the entrance. It moved slowly now, sensing it had its prey trapped. It began to vibrate, a low-frequency hum that Artie could feel in his teeth.\n\n[System Warning: Combat state locked.]\n[Escape Probability: 0.04%]\n\n\"Fizz, do something!\" Artie yelled, pressing his spine against the rock until it hurt. \"Use the wand! Use the book! Throw a rock!\"\n\n\"I\u2019m a Class C Guide!\" Fizz wailed, hovering just out of the slime's reach. \"I\u2019m not allowed to interfere in active combat unless there\u2019s a total System crash! It\u2019s against the terms of service!\"\n\nThe slime began to flatten itself, spreading out across the floor of the crevice like a rising tide of acid. There was nowhere to jump, nowhere to climb. Artie looked at his hands again. They were still empty, his lanky frame trembling. \n\nThe creature reared back for its final lunge, a shimmering glob of neon death. Artie stared at the '1/1' in his vision, the red bar pulsing with a frantic, rhythmic light. He was a 'Statistical Anomaly,' a god of the critical hit, a walking glitch in the matrix\u2014and he was about to be deleted by a puddle of lime-flavored jelly because he couldn't take a single, solitary scratch.\n\nThe slime launched.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"CHAR_FIZZ\"],\n    \"location\": \"Whispering Woods\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie spawned into the Whispering Woods tutorial zone with 1 HP.\",\n      \"Artie encountered a Level 1 Lesser Puddle Slime that deals lethal damage.\",\n      \"Artie is cornered in a rocky crevice with no escape.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"]\n  },\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"inventory\": [],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\"container\": \"pocket_right\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"contents\": []},\n        {\"container\": \"pocket_left\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"contents\": []}\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie is experiencing extreme existential dread due to his 1 HP vulnerability.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_FIZZ\",\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\"item\": \"ITEM_fizz_wand\", \"container\": \"belt\", \"status\": \"stowed\"},\n        {\"item\": \"ITEM_guidebook\", \"container\": \"satchel\", \"status\": \"stowed\"}\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\"container\": \"belt\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_FIZZ\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_fizz_wand\"]},\n        {\"container\": \"satchel\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_FIZZ\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_guidebook\"]}\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"character_continuity_system_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"set\": {\n        \"stats\": {\n          \"hp\": {\"current\": 1, \"max\": 1},\n          \"crit_rate\": 100,\n          \"level\": 1,\n          \"escape_probability\": 0.04\n        },\n        \"statuses\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"Glitched: Crit-Only\",\n            \"effect\": \"All non-critical hits deal 0 damage.

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\n\ufeffOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}]\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the

Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: pre-scene invariants and summary facts are binding unless the Scene Card depicts a change. If this scene changes a durable fact, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value and remove the old entry.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again.

The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If a durable appearance change occurs in this scene, record it in character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- APPEARANCE_CHECK is required in COMPLIANCE for each cast_present_id (4-8 tokens from atoms/marks).\n\nNaming repairs:\n- If lint flags an item naming issue, fix it with minimal edits.\n- Do not remove humor;

Woods felt less like a magical teleportation and more like being shoved through a digital meat grinder. One moment, Artie Penhaligon was standing in a vacuum of pure potential; the next, his boots hit damp soil with a squelch that vibrated all the way up his lanky frame. \n\nThe air was thick with the scent of pine needles and something suspiciously like ozone. High above, the canopy of the Whispering Woods didn't just sway; it pulsed. The leaves were a vibrant, oversaturated green that hurt to look at for too long, shimmering with a faint, low-resolution haze.\n\n[Location: Whispering Woods - Tutorial Zone]\n[Safety Rating: Low (Newbie-Friendlyish)]\n\n\"Welcome to the grind, Artie!\" Fizz chirped, her neon pink hair leaving a trail of magenta sparks as she zipped in a tight circle around his head. Her pixelated wings hummed like a high-end drone. \"Try not to breathe too deep. The atmospheric rendering is still a bit buggy in this sector.\"\n\nArtie didn't respond. He was too busy staring at the corner of his vision, where a tiny, pathetic red bar sat like a ticking time bomb.\n\n[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon - Lvl 1]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Crit Rate: 100%]\n[Status: Glitched (Crit-Only)]\n\n\"One,\" Artie whispered, his voice cracking. \"Fizz, it really says one. I thought maybe... once we spawned in, the System would round up? Or give me a 'Pity Shield'? Or literally anything other than a single point of structural integrity?\"\n\nFizz hovered at eye level, her glowing violet eyes scanning him with a mix of pity and professional detachment. She reached into the satchel hanging at her side, though she didn't pull anything out yet. \"I checked the manual, Artie. 'The Noob's Guide to Not Dying' is very clear on this. Page four hundred and twelve: 'A character with one hit point is technically alive, which is the preferred state for beginning a quest.' It doesn't say anything about it being a *good* idea.\"\n\n\"Technically alive is the worst kind of alive,\" Artie muttered. He looked down at his hands. They were empty. No sword, no shield, not even a sturdy stick. Just his pale, lanky fingers and a growing sense of existential dread. \"Where's the starter gear? Don't I get a rusted spoon or a damp rag to defend myself with?\"\n\n\"Tutorial gear spawns at the first Milestone Marker,\" Fizz explained, pointing a tiny, iridescent finger toward a clearing ahead. \"But honestly, with your build, a shield would just be a very expensive way to die in one hit while carrying something heavy. You\u2019re a 'Statistical Anomaly,' remember? You\u2019re not supposed to block. You\u2019re supposed to... well, not get hit.\"\n\nArtie stepped forward, his movements cautious and jerky. Every twig that snapped under his boots sounded like a gunshot. Every rustle in the undergrowth made him flinch so hard he nearly tripped over his own feet. In any other game, this would be the peaceful intro\u2014the part where the music is jaunty and the worst thing that can happen is a stray butterfly. Here, a butterfly landing on his shoulder might actually be a game-over event.\n\nThe woods began to live up to their name. A soft, multi-tonal murmuring rose from the trees, a thousand overlapping voices whispering things that sounded like \"Fresh data\" and \"Low defense detected.\" \n\n\"Is the forest talking about my lack of armor?\" Artie asked, his heart hammering against his ribs.\n\n\"It\u2019s just environmental flavor text,\" Fizz said, though she sounded slightly less confident as she glanced at a particularly gnarled oak. \"Mostly. Just keep moving. The first quest NPC is just\u2014\"\n\nShe stopped. The humming of her wings shifted to a higher, sharper pitch.\n\nFrom behind a cluster of glowing blue mushrooms, something wobbled into the light. It was translucent, a sickly shade of neon green, and it jiggled with the rhythmic intensity of a subwoofer. It was the quintessential RPG starter mob: a slime.\n\n[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 1]\n[HP: 10/10]\n\n\"Oh, thank god,\" Artie breathed, leaning forward slightly. \"It\u2019s just a slime. It\u2019s a literal puddle of jelly. I can handle a puddle.\"\n\nThe slime didn't just wobble; it surged. It moved with a surprising, fluid speed, leave a trail of corrosive-looking slime on the grass. As it approached, a small UI window flickered into existence next to its nameplate.\n\n[Combat Estimate: Lethal]\n[Estimated Damage to Player: 2-4]\n[Player HP: 1]\n\nArtie\u2019s blood turned to ice. \"Fizz. Fizz, the math. Look at the math.\"\n\n\"I see it!\" Fizz squeaked, her hand diving into her satchel to pat the cover of 'The Noob's Guide to Not Dying' as if for luck. \"The minimum damage floor for a Level 1 Slime is two! It doesn't matter if it just grazes your pinky toe, Artie! It\u2019s going to do double your total health!\"\n\nThe slime reared back, its gelatinous body stretching upward until it was nearly three feet tall. It didn't have eyes, but Artie could feel its mindless, hungry focus. It lunged.\n\nArtie scrambled backward, his heels catching on a protruding root. He fell, hitting the ground with a thud that sent a jarring shock through his spine. \n\n[HP: 1/1 (Warning: Physical trauma detected. Any further impact will result in Deletion.)]\n\nHe scrambled on his hands and knees, dragging himself away as the slime landed exactly where his chest had been a second ago. The grass hissed and withered where the creature touched it. \n\n\"Run! Artie, use your legs!\" Fizz shouted, darting around the slime\u2019s head to distract it. \"It\u2019s a tutorial mob! Its pathfinding should be terrible!\"\n\nArtie scrambled to his feet and bolted toward a dense thicket of thorns, but the slime was relentless. It wasn't just hopping; it was flowing, molding itself to the terrain with terrifying efficiency. He ducked under a low-hanging branch, his messy brown hair catching on the bark, and veered left into a narrow rocky crevice.\n\nHe realized his mistake the moment his back hit the cold, damp stone. \n\nThe crevice was a dead end. The walls rose high on three sides, slick with moss and jagged edges. He turned, his breath coming in ragged, panicked gasps, to see the neon green mass of the slime filling the entrance. It moved slowly now, sensing it had its prey trapped. It began to vibrate, a low-frequency hum that Artie could feel in his teeth.\n\n[System Warning: Combat state locked.]\n[Escape Probability: 0.04%]\n\n\"Fizz, do something!\" Artie yelled, pressing his spine against the rock until it hurt. \"Use the wand! Use the book! Throw a rock!\"\n\n\"I\u2019m a Class C Guide!\" Fizz wailed, hovering just out of the slime's reach. \"I\u2019m not allowed to interfere in active combat unless there\u2019s a total System crash! It\u2019s against the terms of service!\"\n\nThe slime began to flatten itself, spreading out across the floor of the crevice like a rising tide of acid. There was nowhere to jump, nowhere to climb. Artie looked at his hands again. They were still empty, his lanky frame trembling. \n\nThe creature reared back for its final lunge, a shimmering glob of neon death. Artie stared at the '1/1' in his vision, the red bar pulsing with a frantic, rhythmic light. He was a 'Statistical Anomaly,' a god of the critical hit, a walking glitch in the matrix\u2014and he was about to be deleted by a puddle of lime-flavored jelly because he couldn't take a single, solitary scratch.\n\nThe slime launched.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n
