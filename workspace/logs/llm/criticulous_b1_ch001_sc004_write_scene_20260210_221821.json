It wobbled with a rhythmic, wet thud, its translucent green body jiggling like a bowl of lime gelatin that had developed a grudge against humanity. It lunged, a glob of corrosive slime stretching out like a sticky tongue toward Artie\u2019s chest.\n\nArtie scrambled backward, his heels catching on a protruding root of the ancient oak. He twisted, his heart hammering against his ribs with the frantic beat of a trapped bird.\n\n[Stamina: 90/100]\n\n\"Easy there, Flubber,\" Artie wheezed, his back hitting the rough bark of the tree. \"I\u2019m not on the menu. I\u2019m mostly gristle and student loan debt. You wouldn't like the aftertaste.\"\n\nThe slime didn't care about his financial history. It compressed itself, its base widening as it prepared for a full-body vault. Artie knew the math. The System had been very clear: contact meant 2-4 points of corrosive damage. He had exactly 1 HP. In the grand spreadsheet of life, he was a rounding error waiting to be deleted.\n\n[Combat Log: Lesser Forest Slime prepares 'Acidic Vault'!]\n\n\"Right. My turn,\" Artie said, clenching his fist. He didn't have a sword. He didn't even have a sharpened stick. He had a grey-mesh jumpsuit and a stat sheet that looked like a prank. He stepped forward, trying to channel every action movie he\u2019d ever seen while working late-night data entry. He threw a punch.\n\n[Accuracy Check: 12% (Failure)]\n\nHis fist sailed through the air, missing the slime\u2019s upper curve by a good six inches. The momentum nearly sent him face-first into the gelatinous mass. He overbalanced, flailing his arms to stay upright.\n\n\"Okay, calibration is a bit off,\" he muttered. \"Just a practice swing.\"\n\nThe slime landed where he\u2019d been standing a second ago, the grass beneath it sizzling and turning a sickly shade of brown. It pivoted with surprising agility for a creature without a skeleton. Artie swung again, a desperate hook.\n\n[Accuracy Check: 9% (Failure)]\n\nHe missed so badly he actually spun in a half-circle. The slime hissed\u2014or at least, the air escaping its pores sounded like a hiss\u2014and lashed out with a pseudopod. Artie ducked, the acidic limb whistling over his head and taking a chunk out of the oak tree behind him. The wood smoked instantly.\n\n\"Two! That was two! I'm just building tension!\" Artie shouted, more to convince himself than the monster.\n\nHe tried a straight jab, aiming for the core of the creature where a small, dark pebble floated\u2014its nucleus.\n\n[Accuracy Check: 15% (Failure)]\n\nThe slime rippled, its entire body shifting to the left just as his fist arrived. Artie\u2019s knuckles brushed against the cold, humid air inches from the slime\u2019s surface. He could feel the heat radiating from the acid.\n\n\"Seriously? I\u2019m literally punching a stationary target that\u2019s the size of a beach ball!\"\n\n[Stamina: 82/100]\n\nThe slime didn't stay stationary. It hopped. A short, aggressive burst of movement that forced Artie to dive into the dirt. He rolled, his grey-mesh jumpsuit picking up stains that probably weren't going to come out in the wash. He scrambled to his knees and threw a double-handed smash downward as the slime glided past.\n\n[Accuracy Check: 5% (Failure)]\n\nHis hands hit the dirt with a bone-jarring thud. The slime was already three feet away, preparing for another lunge. Artie\u2019s hands stung from the impact, his fingers tingling with the beginning of a phantom vibration.\n\n\"I hate this game,\" Artie growled. \"I hate the RNG, I hate the woods, and I especially hate you, you sentient booger!\"\n\nHe stood his ground, waiting. The slime was coiled now, vibrating with a high-frequency hum. This was it. The big one. Artie centered his weight, or at least tried to, given his Agility was a flat 1. He watched the green mass, waiting for the tell. The slime launched, a green blur of death aimed straight for his face. \n\nArtie didn't think. He just lunged forward, closing his eyes and throwing a desperate, blind upper-cut.\n\n[Accuracy Check: 99% (Success)]\n\n[Critical Hit Check: 100% (Locked)]\n\n[SUPER-MEGA-ULTRA-CRIT!]\n\nThe moment Artie\u2019s fist connected, the world didn't just make a sound; it felt like the universe had suddenly decided to scream. A blinding flash of white light erupted from the point of contact. The resistance was non-existent. It wasn't like hitting Jell-O; it was like punching through a soap bubble that happened to be filled with the power of a collapsing star.\n\n[System Error: Damage Value '99,999,999' exceeds local variable 'Target_HP']\n\n[Recalculating...]\n\nThe slime didn't just die. It didn't even splash. It simply ceased to exist. One millisecond it was a lethal predator; the next, it was a fine mist of subatomic particles being shoved outward by a kinetic shockwave that defied every law of physics Artie had ever ignored in high school.\n\nThe shockwave didn't stop at the slime. It slammed into the ancient oak tree behind it. The massive trunk, which had stood for centuries, disintegrated. The wood shattered into splinters the size of toothpicks, which were then instantly incinerated by the sheer friction of the air being displaced. A fifty-foot swath of the Whispering Woods was suddenly a very quiet, very empty clearing of charred dirt and drifting ash.\n\nArtie remained standing, his arm still extended in the follow-through of the punch. His fist was glowing with a fading blue light. He blinked, his vision swimming with purple spots from the flash.\n\n\"Uh,\" Artie said.\n\n[Combat Log: Lesser Forest Slime has been... deleted?]\n\n[Experience Gained: 50 (Overkill Bonus: +450)]\n\n[Level Up!]\n\n[Level Up!]\n\n[Current Level: 3]\n\n[Stat Points Gained: 10]\n\nArtie looked at his hand, then at the smoking crater where a tree and a monster had been moments ago. The silence of the woods was absolute now, as if the other creatures had collectively decided that being anywhere near Artie was a terrible career choice.\n\n\"Fizz?\" Artie called out, his voice cracking. \"I think I broke the tutorial.\"\n\n[Warning: Local Reality Stability at 94%. Please refrain from punching the environment.]\n\n\"I didn't mean to punch the environment!\" Artie yelled at the sky. \"I meant to punch the slime! The environment just happened to be behind it!\"\n\nHe sat down heavily on the scorched earth, his legs feeling like overcooked noodles. His stamina was recovering, but his mind was racing. He was Level 3. He had survived. But he was also a walking tactical nuke with the accuracy of a drunk toddler. If he hit something, it died. If he missed... well, he\u2019d already missed five times in a row.\n\n\"One hundred percent crit rate,\" he whispered, staring at his character sheet. \"But if I have to miss five times for every hit, I\u2019m going to run out of forest before I reach the first town.\"\n\nHe looked at the 1/1 HP still sitting in the corner of his vision. The glow was gone from his hand, replaced by the mundane grey of his jumpsuit sleeve. He was still the 'Glassest of Cannons.' He was just a significantly louder one now.\n\n[New Skill Available: Point-Blank Panic]\n\n\"Don't mind if I do,\" Artie muttered, though he wasn't sure if he was talking to the System or himself. He stood up, shaking the ash from his hair, and started walking toward where he thought the path used to be. Behind him, the smoke from the vaporized oak tree drifted up into the canopy, a silent monument to the most inefficiently powerful punch in the history of the Whispering Woods.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_ARTIE\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"Whispering Woods\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie defeated the Lesser Forest Slime with a Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit.\",\n      \"The environment, including an ancient oak tree, was destroyed by the overkill damage.\",\n      \"Artie leveled up to Level 3.\",\n      \"Artie realized his power is extremely destructive but highly inconsistent due to low accuracy.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 4,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\n          \"item\": \"ITEM_JUMPSUIT\",\n          \"container\": \"body\",\n          \"status\": \"equipped\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\n          \"container\": \"body\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n          \"contents\": [\n            \"ITEM_JUMPSUIT\"\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie is now wary of his own power, recognizing that his 'Crit-Only' build is as dangerous to the world as it is to his enemies.\",\n        \"Artie is developing a 'survivor's gallows humor' regarding his 1 HP status.\"\n      ],\n      \"invariants_add\": [\n        \"milestone: first_kill = DONE\",\n        \"milestone: environment_destroyed = DONE\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"character_continuity_system_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"set\": {\n        \"classes\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"Statistical Anomaly\",\n            \"level\": 3\n          }\n        ],\n        \"stats\": {\n          \"hp\": {\n            \"current\": 1,\n            \"max\": 1\n          }\n        },\n        \"skills\": {\n          \"Point-Blank Panic\": 1\n        }\n      },\n      \"delta\": {\n        \"resources\": {\n          \"stamina\": {\n            \"current\": -13\n          }\n        }\n      },\n      \"reason\": \"Level up from slime kill and overkill bonus; skill gain from combat experience.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie faced a Lesser Forest Slime in the Whispering Woods.

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nItem naming: use display_name for prose; use item_id only in JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\n\ufeffOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the

No recap.\n- Summaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\n- Use the continuity pack and state for continuity.\n- Use character_registry to keep names consistent in prose.\n- Timeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\n- State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\n- Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n- Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\n- Inventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- For held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\n- Continuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or '(locked)' only.\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\n- titles are arrays of objects with stable name fields; do not emit titles as plain strings.\n- If item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for ownership/custody labels in authoritative outputs.\n- Use item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\n- If a required event is not in the Scene Card, do not perform it.\n- Enforce scene-card durable constraints: honor `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, and `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\n- Respect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope` when proposing durable mutations; do not mutate physical custody in non-present/non-real scope unless explicitly marked override.\n- summary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\n- STATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\n- If state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\n- Return prose plus a state_patch JSON block.\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n- All *_updates arrays must contain objects; never emit bare strings as array entries.\n- character_updates.containers must be an array of objects with at least: container, owner, contents (array).\n- Durable-state mutation blocks are mandatory when applicable:\n- Required fields for durable registry entries (when creating NEW ids or filling missing required fields):\n  - item_registry_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry requires item_id and can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n    - INVALID: item_registry_updates = {\"set\": {\"ITEM_X\": {...}}}\n    - VALID: item_registry_updates = [{\"item_id\": \"ITEM_X\", \"set\": {...}}]\n  - plot_device_updates MUST be an array of objects.

Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_device_id, replacement_of.\n  - plot_device_updates: set must include name, custody_scope, custody_ref, activation_state, linked_threads, constraints, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects;

I checked the floating red bar hovering above its translucent, jiggly head. \n\n[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 3] [HP: 45/45]\n\nForty-five health. At my current Strength of 12, with a base weapon damage of 4-6, I was looking at a nine-hit kill minimum, assuming the RNG gods didn't decide to spit on my shoes today. \n\n\"You know,\" I said, adjusting my grip on the rusted shortsword. \"In most worlds, puddles are for stepping in, not for getting dissolved by.\"\n\nThe slime responded by launching a glob of corrosive mucus. I rolled left, the grass staining my knees.\n\n[Stamina: 88/100]\n\n\"Missed me. Barely. That\u2019s a three-second cooldown on your spit, isn't it?\"\n\nI didn't wait for the confirmation. I lunged. The blade sank into the gelatinous mass with a sound like a heavy boot pulling out of thick mud.\n\n[Critical Hit! -14 HP]\n\n\"There we go. Who needs luck when you have math?\"\n\nThe slime shuddered, its HP bar dipping into the yellow. \n\n[HP: 31/45]\n\n\"One more of those and we can talk about your retirement plan,\" I muttered. My lungs burned slightly, a reminder that my Agility was still garbage. \n\n[Passive Skill Gained: Basic Analysis (Rank F)]\n[Description: You can see basic stats and cooldowns of enemies within 5 meters. You\u2019ve stopped guessing and started counting. Good for you.]\n\n\"Finally,\" I breathed, dodging another glob. \"The ding is coming. I can practically taste the experience points. They taste like copper and bad decisions.\" \n\nI swung again, the numbers popping in the air like neon confetti. This wasn't just a fight; it was a grind.
