Artie Penhaligon stumbled, his loafers skidding on grass that was a little too springy to be natural. He instinctively reached up to steady the Corporate ID Badge hanging from his neck. The plastic clicked against his chest, a comforting, mundane sound in a world that had abandoned the concept of \"normal\" three minutes ago.\n\n\"Welcome to the Tutorial Zone, User 001-ALPHA!\" Fizz chirped, her tiny, glowing blue form zipping around Artie\u2019s head like a caffeinated firefly. She left a trail of pixelated dust that smelled faintly of ozone and blueberry muffins. \"Or as I like to call it: The Place Where Math Meets the Meat-Grinder. Isn't it picturesque?\"\n\nArtie squinted. The sky was a shade of cyan that suggested the atmosphere was made of Gatorade. In the distance, rolling hills of vibrant turf were dotted with trees that looked like they\u2019d been copy-pasted by a developer who was five minutes away from a weekend bender.\n\n\"It\u2019s... bright,\" Artie said, his voice raspy. He patted his sides, feeling the reassuring bulk of his Smartphone in his left pocket and his Leather Wallet in his right. He was still wearing his office attire\u2014a rumpled button-down that now bore the scorched, jagged patterns of his untimely demise. The severe electrical burns on his chest throbbed with a dull, phantom heat, a reminder that he was technically a dead man walking.\n\n[Location: The Slime Fields (Tutorial Zone)]\n[Difficulty: Laughable (For most people)]\n[Warning: Reality Stability is currently at 95%. Expect minor graphical artifacts.]\n\n\"Picturesque isn't the word I'd use,\" Artie muttered, looking down at his hands. He could see the faint keyboard callus on his right palm. \"So, what\u2019s the plan? I kill a few things, I get some levels, I find a way to stop being a walking heart-attack risk?\"\n\nFizz landed on his shoulder, her weightless presence barely registering. \"About that! Since you decided to play 'Optimal Spreadsheet' with your life, we should probably check your status. Just so you know exactly how much of a gentle breeze it\u2019ll take to delete you.\"\n\nArtie sighed and mentally willed the screen into existence.\n\n[Name: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]\n[Title: Crit or Quit]\n[Level: 1]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Crit Rate: 100%]\n[Status: Glass Soul (Permanent)]\n\n[Glass Soul: Your spirit is as sharp as a diamond and just as fragile.

On the bright side, you\u2019ll never have to worry about hospital bills.]\n\n\"One,\" Artie whispered, the word feeling heavy in his mouth. \"I have one hit point. Fizz, I\u2019ve had hangovers with more durability than this.\"\n\n\"Hey, you're the one who dumped sixty points into Critical Hit Rate!\" Fizz reminded him, doing a somersault in the air. \"You're a statistical god, Artie. You just happen to be a god made of wet tissue paper. Look! Your first fan is approaching.\"\n\nArtie looked up. Emerging from behind a particularly blocky bush was a wobbling mound of translucent green jelly. It was about the size of a beach ball, with two vacant, black-dot eyes and a rhythmic pulse that made it look like a giant, sentient booger.\n\n[Lesser Green Slime - Lvl 1]\n[HP: 10/10]\n[Status: Hungry]\n\nThe slime didn't roar. It made a sound like a plunger being pulled out of a sink. Schlorp. It began to undulate toward Artie, leaving a glistening trail of slime on the grass.\n\n\"Okay,\" Artie said, backing up a step. \"It\u2019s a slime. It\u2019s a Level One slime. In every game I\u2019ve ever played, these things are basically experience-point pinatas. I can handle this.\"\n\n\"Normally, yes,\" Fizz said, her voice dropping into a tone of mock-seriousness. \"Normally, a Level One player can take about five or six hits from a Lesser Green Slime before they need a potion. But you? Artie, if that thing so much as sneezes in your general direction, you\u2019re going back to the vending machine in the sky.\"\n\nThe slime accelerated. It wasn't fast, but it was persistent. It launched itself forward in a small hop, landing with a wet thud a few feet closer.\n\nArtie felt a cold sweat break out on his neck. He looked around for a weapon\u2014a stick, a rock, anything\u2014but the Slime Fields were suspiciously well-manicured. \n\n\"Wait, if I have a hundred percent crit rate, I just need to hit it once, right?\" Artie asked, his heart hammering against his ribs.\n\n\"Technically, yes! But you have zero Strength, Artie. You're a 'slender' build with the physical power of a damp noodle. Your crits will multiply your damage, but ten times zero is still zero. You need to find a way to actually... you know... damage it.\"\n\nThe slime hopped again. This time, it cleared three feet. It was close enough now that Artie could smell it\u2014a cloying, sugary scent like lime Jell-O left in the sun.\n\n\"Fizz, it's looking at me,\" Artie said, his voice rising an octave. \"Why is it looking at me like that?\"\n\n\"Because you're a Level One Anomaly and you look delicious! Also, you're standing in its path. Move, Artie! Use those legs!\"\n\nArtie scrambled backward, but his heel caught on a tuft of the springy grass. He flailed, his arms windmilling as he fought to keep his balance. His Corporate ID Badge swung wildly on its lanyard. He managed to stay upright, but the slime was now only five feet away. It paused, its body quivering as it prepared for a larger leap.\n\n[Combat Log: Lesser Green Slime is charging 'Tutorial Bounce'!]\n\n\"Charging?\" Artie yelled. \"Since when do slimes charge?\"\n\n\"Since you entered the world on 'Hardcore Mode'!\" Fizz shouted back, retreating to a safe distance in the air. \"Artie, listen to me. The Glass Soul isn't just a debuff. It\u2019s a reality. You cannot be touched. Not by the slime, not by the grass if it\u2019s too sharp, not by me if I accidentally glitch through you. You are a one-hit-point wonder. Act like it!\"\n\nThe slime launched. \n\nIt was a slow-motion nightmare. The green mass expanded as it flew through the air, its translucent body catching the Gatorade-blue sunlight. Artie dived to the right, feeling the rush of air as the slime sailed past his ear. He hit the ground hard, the impact jarring his bones.\n\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Warning: Impact registered. Durability check passed. Barely.]\n\nArtie scrambled to his feet, his breath coming in ragged gasps. He looked at the slime, which had landed and was already turning around with a wet, squelching sound. It seemed faster now. More focused. \n\n\"I can't do this,\" Artie panted, his eyes darting around the field. \"I'm an accountant, Fizz! I track losses, I don't experience them personally!\"\n\n\"Well, start accounting for your life, because here it comes again!\"\n\nThe slime didn't hop this time. It began to stretch, its body elongating until it looked like a green serpent. It lashed out, a whip-like appendage of jelly snapping toward Artie\u2019s ankles. Artie jumped\u2014a clumsy, desperate hop\u2014and the slime-whip whistled beneath his feet.\n\nHe landed in a patch of mud, his loafers sinking into the muck. He was cornered against a large, blocky rock that looked like it had been rendered with a low polygon count. The slime sensed his hesitation. It stopped lashing and began to expand, growing larger and larger as it pulled more mass from its own center. It was preparing for a full-body slam.\n\nArtie backed up until his spine hit the cold, hard surface of the rock. He looked at the slime, then at his own trembling hands. He had no weapon. He had no armor. He had a Corporate ID Badge, a Smartphone, and a Leather Wallet. \n\n[Lesser Green Slime - Lvl 1]\n[Status: Aggroed]\n[Action: Tutorial Slam in 3... 2...]\n\n\"Fizz!\" Artie screamed. \"Advice! Now!\"\n\n\"Don't get hit!\" she yelled back, her blue glow flickering with excitement. \"And maybe try to find the 'Crit' in 'Crit or Quit' before you become a floor stain!\"\n\nThe slime launched itself, a wall of green jelly filling Artie\u2019s vision. He realized, with a clarity that only comes to the terminally doomed, that this was it. One touch, and the game was over before the tutorial even finished.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n

    "system": "\ufeff# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nUI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says \"always include\".\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true. If a prior invariant is stale or superseded, you MUST flag it for removal using \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" before restating the current truth.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v2\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}]\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the

        "content": "# REPAIR\n\nFix the scene based on lint issues.\nSummaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\nTimeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: pre-scene invariants and summary facts are binding unless the Scene Card depicts a change. If this scene changes a durable fact, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value and remove the old entry.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n\n- must_stay_true removal (mandatory when a durable fact is superseded):\n  - Add \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" in summary_update.must_stay_true.\n  - Place REMOVE lines before the new final invariant.\n  - REMOVE lines also apply to key_facts_ring (purge stale facts from continuity).\n\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- Inventory posture reconciliation:\n  - If inventory/containers change (held/stowed/container), must_stay_true must be updated to the final posture.\n  - Add REMOVE lines for prior inventory/container invariants before the new final entries.\n  - Use canonical invariant formats:\n    - inventory: CHAR_X -> <item display_name> (status=held|carried|equipped|stowed, container=hand_left|hand_right|<container>)\n    - container: <container> (owner=CHAR_X, contents=[<item display_name>, ...])\nFor held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\nContinuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.\n- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.\n- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.\n- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI gate: only include bracketed UI blocks when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If false, remove or rephrase UI blocks into narrative prose.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or a short parenthetical annotation (e.g., (locked), (Warning: ...)).\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nCanonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\nIf item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for authoritative labels and custody terms.\nUse item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If a durable appearance change occurs in this scene, record it in character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- APPEARANCE_CHECK is required in COMPLIANCE for each cast_present_id (4-8 tokens from atoms/marks).\n\nNaming repairs:\n- If lint flags an item naming issue, fix it with minimal edits.\n- Do not remove humor; simply anchor the item (add display_name near first mention) and ensure custody-change sentences include the display_name.\n- Do not rename item_id or registry fields; only adjust prose wording.\nsummary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\nSTATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\nmust_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\nIf state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\nEnforce scene-card durable constraints: `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\nRespect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`.\n\n- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):\n  - If timeline_scope != \"present\" OR ontological_scope != \"real\", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).\n  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.\n  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category=\"timeline_override\".\n\nReturn corrected prose plus a corrected state_patch JSON block.\n\nOutput format (required, no code fences, no commentary):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n\nAPPEARANCE_CHECK:\n- CHAR_ID: <4-8 tokens from atoms/marks>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects.

Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_device_id, replacement_of.\n  - custodian must be a non-null string id/scope (character id or \"world\"). Never use null.\n    - INVALID: \"custodian\": null\n    - VALID: \"custodian\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\" or \"world\"\n  - owner_scope must be \"character\" or \"world\" and must match the custodian scope.\n  - plot_device_updates: set must include name, custody_scope, custody_ref, activation_state, linked_threads, constraints, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n\n- Transfer vs registry conflict rule (must follow):\n  - If you create a NEW item in item_registry_updates with final custodian already set (e.g., CHAR_ARTIE), DO NOT emit transfer_updates for that item.\n  - If you emit transfer_updates for a NEW item, the registry entry must start with custodian=\"world\" and then transfer to the character.\n  - expected_before must match the registry entry at the moment of transfer (after any registry update that applies before it).  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects; never an object with an `updates` field.\n\n  - inventory_alignment_updates[*].set MUST be an object (not a list).\n    - INVALID: \"set\": []\n    - VALID:   \"set\": {\"inventory\": [...], \"containers\": [...]}\n- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.\n- If you mutate durable state, do not leave the same mutation only in prose.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n- appearance_updates: when a durable appearance change happens, include appearance_updates on the relevant character_updates entry.\n\n  - appearance_updates MUST be an object, not an array.\n    - INVALID: \"appearance_updates\": [{\"set\": {...}, \"reason\": \"...\"}]\n    - VALID: \"appearance_updates\": {\"set\": {\"marks_add\": [{\"name\": \"Singed Hair\", \"location\": \"head\", \"durability\": \"durable\"}]}, \"reason\": \"...\"}\n\n  - appearance_updates.set may include atoms and marks only (canonical truth).\n    - Do NOT put marks_add at the top level;

}\n]\n\nScene:\nThe transition from the absolute white of the System Void to the neon-green saturation of the Slime Fields felt like being slapped in the face with a wet, radioactive towel. Artie Penhaligon stumbled, his loafers skidding on grass that was a little too springy to be natural. He instinctively reached up to steady the Corporate ID Badge hanging from his neck. The plastic clicked against his chest, a comforting, mundane sound in a world that had abandoned the concept of \"normal\" three minutes ago.\n\n\"Welcome to the Tutorial Zone, User 001-ALPHA!\" Fizz chirped, her tiny, glowing blue form zipping around Artie\u2019s head like a caffeinated firefly. She left a trail of pixelated dust that smelled faintly of ozone and blueberry muffins. \"Or as I like to call it: The Place Where Math Meets the Meat-Grinder. Isn't it picturesque?\"\n\nArtie squinted. The sky was a shade of cyan that suggested the atmosphere was made of Gatorade. In the distance, rolling hills of vibrant turf were dotted with trees that looked like they\u2019d been copy-pasted by a developer who was five minutes away from a weekend bender.\n\n\"It\u2019s... bright,\" Artie said, his voice raspy. He patted his sides, feeling the reassuring bulk of his Smartphone in his left pocket and his Leather Wallet in his right. He was still wearing his office attire\u2014a rumpled button-down that now bore the scorched, jagged patterns of his untimely demise. The severe electrical burns on his chest throbbed with a dull, phantom heat, a reminder that he was technically a dead man walking.\n\n[Location: The Slime Fields (Tutorial Zone)]\n[Difficulty: Laughable (For most people)]\n[Warning: Reality Stability is currently at 95%. Expect minor graphical artifacts.]\n\n\"Picturesque isn't the word I'd use,\" Artie muttered, looking down at his hands. He could see the faint keyboard callus on his right palm. \"So, what\u2019s the plan? I kill a few things, I get some levels, I find a way to stop being a walking heart-attack risk?\"\n\nFizz landed on his shoulder, her weightless presence barely registering. \"About that! Since you decided to play 'Optimal Spreadsheet' with your life, we should probably check your status. Just so you know exactly how much of a gentle breeze it\u2019ll take to delete you.\"\n\nArtie sighed and mentally willed the screen into existence.\n\n[Name: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]\n[Title: Crit or Quit]\n[Level: 1]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Crit Rate: 100%]\n[Status: Glass Soul (Permanent)]\n\n[Glass Soul: Your spirit is as sharp as a diamond and just as fragile. HP is locked at 1. All incoming damage\u2014including environmental, status-based, or stubbed toes\u2014is fatal. On the bright side, you\u2019ll never have to worry about hospital bills.]\n\n\"One,\" Artie whispered, the word feeling heavy in his mouth. \"I have one hit point. Fizz, I\u2019ve had hangovers with more durability than this.\"\n\n\"Hey, you're the one who dumped sixty points into Critical Hit Rate!\" Fizz reminded him, doing a somersault in the air. \"You're a statistical god, Artie. You just happen to be a god made of wet tissue paper. Look! Your first fan is approaching.\"\n\nArtie looked up. Emerging from behind a particularly blocky bush was a wobbling mound of translucent green jelly. It was about the size of a beach ball, with two vacant, black-dot eyes and a rhythmic pulse that made it look like a giant, sentient booger.\n\n[Lesser Green Slime - Lvl 1]\n[HP: 10/10]\n[Status: Hungry]\n\nThe slime didn't roar. It made a sound like a plunger being pulled out of a sink. *Schlorp.* It began to undulate toward Artie, leaving a glistening trail of slime on the grass.\n\n\"Okay,\" Artie said, backing up a step. \"It\u2019s a slime. It\u2019s a Level One slime. In every game I\u2019ve ever played, these things are basically experience-point pinatas. I can handle this.\"\n\n\"Normally, yes,\" Fizz said, her voice dropping into a tone of mock-seriousness. \"Normally, a Level One player can take about five or six hits from a Lesser Green Slime before they need a potion. But you? Artie, if that thing so much as sneezes in your general direction, you\u2019re going back to the vending machine in the sky.\"\n\nThe slime accelerated. It wasn't fast, but it was persistent. It launched itself forward in a small hop, landing with a wet *thud* a few feet closer.\n\nArtie felt a cold sweat break out on his neck. He looked around for a weapon\u2014a stick, a rock, anything\u2014but the Slime Fields were suspiciously well-manicured. \n\n\"Wait, if I have a hundred percent crit rate, I just need to hit it once, right?\" Artie asked, his heart hammering against his ribs.\n\n\"Technically, yes! But you have zero Strength, Artie. You're a 'slender' build with the physical power of a damp noodle. Your crits will multiply your damage, but ten times zero is still zero. You need to find a way to actually... you know... *damage* it.\"\n\nThe slime hopped again. This time, it cleared three feet. It was close enough now that Artie could smell it\u2014a cloying, sugary scent like lime Jell-O left in the sun.\n\n\"Fizz, it's looking at me,\" Artie said, his voice rising an octave. \"Why is it looking at me like that?\"\n\n\"Because you're a Level One Anomaly and you look delicious! Also, you're standing in its path. Move, Artie! Use those legs!\"\n\nArtie scrambled backward, but his heel caught on a tuft of the springy grass. He flailed, his arms windmilling as he fought to keep his balance. His Corporate ID Badge swung wildly on its lanyard. He managed to stay upright, but the slime was now only five feet away. It paused, its body quivering as it prepared for a larger leap.\n\n[Combat Log: Lesser Green Slime is charging 'Tutorial Bounce'!]\n\n\"Charging?\" Artie yelled. \"Since when do slimes charge?\"\n\n\"Since you entered the world on 'Hardcore Mode'!\" Fizz shouted back, retreating to a safe distance in the air. \"Artie, listen to me. The Glass Soul isn't just a debuff. It\u2019s a reality. You cannot be touched. Not by the slime, not by the grass if it\u2019s too sharp, not by me if I accidentally glitch through you. You are a one-hit-point wonder. Act like it!\"\n\nThe slime launched. \n\nIt was a slow-motion nightmare. The green mass expanded as it flew through the air, its translucent body catching the Gatorade-blue sunlight. Artie dived to the right, feeling the rush of air as the slime sailed past his ear. He hit the ground hard, the impact jarring his bones.\n\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Warning: Impact registered. Durability check passed. Barely.]\n\nArtie scrambled to his feet, his breath coming in ragged gasps. He looked at the slime, which had landed and was already turning around with a wet, squelching sound. It seemed faster now. More focused. \n\n\"I can't do this,\" Artie panted, his eyes darting around the field. \"I'm an accountant, Fizz! I track losses, I don't experience them personally!\"\n\n\"Well, start accounting for your life, because here it comes again!\"\n\nThe slime didn't hop this time. It began to stretch, its body elongating until it looked like a green serpent. It lashed out, a whip-like appendage of jelly snapping toward Artie\u2019s ankles. Artie jumped\u2014a clumsy, desperate hop\u2014and the slime-whip whistled beneath his feet.\n\nHe landed in a patch of mud, his loafers sinking into the muck. He was cornered against a large, blocky rock that looked like it had been rendered with a low polygon count. The slime sensed his hesitation. It stopped lashing and began to expand, growing larger and larger as it pulled more mass from its own center. It was preparing for a full-body slam.\n\nArtie backed up until his spine hit the cold, hard surface of the rock. He looked at the slime, then at his own trembling hands. He had no weapon. He had no armor. He had a Corporate ID Badge, a Smartphone, and a Leather Wallet. \n\n[Lesser Green Slime - Lvl 1]\n[Status: Aggroed]\n[Action: Tutorial Slam in 3... 2...]\n\n\"Fizz!\" Artie screamed. \"Advice! Now!\"\n\n\"Don't get hit!\" she yelled back, her blue glow flickering with excitement. \"And maybe try to find the 'Crit' in 'Crit or Quit' before you become a floor stain!\"\n\nThe slime launched itself, a wall of green jelly filling Artie\u2019s vision. He realized, with a clarity that only comes to the terminally doomed, that this was it. One touch, and the game was over before the tutorial even finished.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n
