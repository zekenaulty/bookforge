Notes: LitRPG focus: explicit game mechanics, stat windows, progression loops, skill trees, loot/gear economy, clear power scaling; light-novel / isekai roots and pacing; comedic voice with sharp observational humor and punchy timing; detailed but funny prose; tight POV; avoid purple exposition; keep mechanics grounded in story stakes.
