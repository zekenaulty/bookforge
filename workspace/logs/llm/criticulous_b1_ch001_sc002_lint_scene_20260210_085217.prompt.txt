# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
Item naming: use display_name for prose; use item_id only in JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Continuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.
Continuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.
Durable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.
Inventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

﻿Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.
Durable vs ephemeral mechanics:
- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.
- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.
- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).
- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.
For durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
For durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).
Use canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.


USER:

﻿# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Classify UI/prose mechanic claims as DURABLE or EPHEMERAL before enforcing.
  - DURABLE: persistent stats/caps, skills/titles acquired, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, named mechanics referenced as invariants.
  - EPHEMERAL: roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat telemetry.
- Enforce DURABLE claims against authoritative_surfaces/state/registries.
- EPHEMERAL claims do not require state ownership; only flag EPHEMERAL contradictions inside the same scene as warnings.
- If uncertain, default to EPHEMERAL (warning at most), not DURABLE (error).
- status="fail" only if there is at least one issue with severity="error"; warnings alone => status="pass".
- Treat only authoritative surfaces as canonical-check targets; do not enforce canonical labels in narrative prose.
- For authoritative surfaces, prefer exact canonical item/device labels from registries.
- For milestone repetition/future checks, compare against PRE-INVARIANTS only (pre-scene canon).
- For ownership/consistency checks, compare against POST-STATE (post-patch candidate).
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).
  - Ignore first-person pronouns inside quoted dialogue; only narration counts.
- Deterministically enforce scene-card durable constraints (required_in_custody, required_scene_accessible, forbidden_visible, device_presence; optional required_visible_on_page).
- Durable constraint evaluation must use POST-STATE candidate (after patch), not pre-state.
- Report missing durable context ids with explicit retry hints instead of guessing canon.
- For each issue, include evidence when possible (line number + excerpt) as {"evidence": {"line": N, "excerpt": "..."}}.

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity
- evidence

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The void didn't smell like ozone or ancient magic; it smelled like a server room that hadn't been dusted since the nineties. I was suspended in a vast, milky nothingness that made my eyes ache if I tried to focus on the horizon—mostly because there wasn't one. 

"Stop squinting, Arthur. You’re making a face like a constipated gargoyle, and it’s messing with the facial recognition software."

I spun around, or tried to. In zero-G, spinning just results in a very slow, very humiliating tumble. A small, glowing figure zipped into my line of sight. She was about the size of a soda can, wings fluttering with the frantic energy of a hummingbird on a caffeine bender. She wore a miniature tailored suit that looked far more expensive than my ruined office gear.

"Who—or what—are you?" I asked, finally stabilizing myself by kicking at the empty air.

"I am Fizz, your assigned System Guide," she said, pulling a tiny holographic tablet from thin air. 

[The Official System Guidebook (v4.2)] (locked)

"And you," she continued, tapping the screen with a translucent fingernail, "are a statistical nightmare. Do you have any idea how hard it is to file a 'Death by Vending Machine' claim? The paperwork alone is going to take me through the next fiscal quarter."

"I was trying to get my Cheesy-Poofs, Fizz. It was a matter of principle."

"It was a matter of twelve volts and a complete lack of self-preservation," she snapped. 

[System Notification]
[Character Creation Phase: INITIALIZING]
[Subject: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[Base Class: Office Drone (Level 1)]
[Available Stat Points: 20]

"Twenty points?" I looked at the floating blue screen. "Is that good? Does that get me a sword? Or maybe a body that isn't currently a cloud of digital dust?"

Fizz hovered near my ear, her wings humming. "Twenty is the standard 'You Lived a Boring Life' package. Most people put ten into Stamina and ten into Strength so they can survive the first five minutes of the tutorial. Given your track record with inanimate objects, I’d suggest putting all twenty into Intelligence. Maybe then you’ll learn not to kick things that are plugged into a wall."

I ignored her. I was staring at the list of attributes. 

[Strength: 5]
[Agility: 5]
[Intelligence: 5]
[Stamina: 5]
[Luck: 1]
[Crit Rate: 0.01%]

"Wait, why is Luck only one? And what’s this Crit Rate?"

"Luck is a premium stat, Arthur. You clearly didn't have much of it back home," Fizz said, yawning. "And Crit Rate is the percentage chance to deal double damage. It’s usually tied to Agility and Luck, but for you, it’s basically a rounding error. Forget about it. Just pump Stamina. You need the HP."

I looked at my current HP readout.

[HP: 10/10]

Ten health points. According to the log of my demise, the vending machine had hit me for twelve. I was a glass figurine in a world made of hammers. 

"If I put points into Stamina, how much HP do I get?" I asked.

"One point of Stamina equals five HP," Fizz replied. "Standard tank build. Do the math, Office Drone."

I looked at the 'Crit Rate' stat again. There was a small, flickering icon next to it—a gear that looked slightly misaligned with the rest of the UI. I reached out, my finger hovering over the plus sign.

"What happens if I touch this?"

"Don't. That’s the sub-menu for advanced multipliers. It’s locked for players under Level 50."

I touched it.

The screen didn't just flicker; it screamed. A high-pitched digital whine echoed through the void, and the blue UI turned a violent, bleeding red.

[WARNING: UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO CORE MULTIPLIERS]
[SYSTEM ERROR: RECALCULATING...]

"Arthur! What did you do?" Fizz shrieked, her tiny suit ruffling as she tried to grab my hand. "Get away from that! You’re going to trigger a hard reset!"

The sliders on the screen began to move on their own. The twenty available points didn't just disappear into the stats; they started draining the base values.

[Strength: 5 -> 1]
[Agility: 5 -> 1]
[Intelligence: 5 -> 1]
[Stamina: 5 -> 0]

"My Stamina is zero?" I gasped. My vision blurred. I felt... thin. Like I was being stretched across a canvas that was too large.

[HP: 10 -> 1]

[Critical Error: Minimum Value Reached]
[Overflow Detected: Redirecting Excess Data to Secondary Variable...]

The numbers beside 'Crit Rate' began to spin like a slot machine. 

[Crit Rate: 0.01%... 10%... 50%... 99.9%...]

"Stop it! Arthur, cancel the allocation!" Fizz was frantically punching commands into her own tablet, but the holographic screen was sparking. "The System is trying to balance the loss of base stats by dumping the potential energy into the nearest active variable! You're breaking the math!"

[Crit Rate: 100%]

The spinning stopped. The red screen turned a calm, terrifying gold.

[Stat Allocation Complete]
[Final Build Confirmed]
[Current Stats:]
[Strength: 1]
[Agility: 1]
[Intelligence: 1]
[Stamina: 0]
[Luck: 1]
[Crit Rate: 100%]
[HP: 1/1]

"One HP," I whispered. "I have one health point."

"You're a glitch," Fizz said, her voice trembling with a mix of awe and pure, unadulterated fury. "You have the physical durability of a wet paper towel, but you have a hundred percent critical hit rate. Do you understand what that means?"

"I'm going to be very good at hitting things?"

"It means if a butterfly sneezes in your general direction, you die," she yelled. "But if you so much as poke a dragon in the eye, the System is going to treat it like a god-slaying blow. You’ve turned yourself into a 'Crit or Quit' build, Arthur. There is no middle ground."

[New Title Gained: The Glass Anomaly]
[Description: You are a walking rounding error. Your existence is a middle finger to the laws of probability. Enjoy your 1 HP. Try not to trip.]

The void around us began to crack. Long, jagged lines of white light tore through the milky nothingness, revealing glimpses of green grass and a sky that was far too blue to be real.

"The tutorial is loading," Fizz said, tucking her tablet away and looking at me with genuine pity. "I'd tell you to good luck, but you only have one point in that, too. Try to stay behind something solid. Like a mountain. Or a very large rock."

"Hey, Fizz?" I said as the floor began to manifest beneath my feet.

"What now, Anomaly?"

"Does the tutorial have vending machines?"

She didn't answer. The light swallowed us both, and the world of Crit Hit & Run began to render.
