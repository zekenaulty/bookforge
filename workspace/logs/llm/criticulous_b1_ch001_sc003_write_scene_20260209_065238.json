One moment I was staring at a snarky UI and a floating guide who looked like she\u2019d rather be anywhere else, and the next, the smell of damp pine and rot hit me like a physical blow.\n\nI stumbled, my feet catching on a stray root. My heart did a frantic tap-dance against my ribs.\n\n[System Notification: Warning!]\n[Status: Fragile is active.]\n[Caution: Physical impact detected. HP: 1/1. Any further trauma will result in immediate Deletion.]\n\n\"Easy there, Glass Joe,\" Fizz said, her voice floating down from somewhere above my left shoulder. She was lazily flipping through the *Standard Guide's Manual*, her translucent wings buzzing with a sound that reminded me of a failing fluorescent light. \"The ground is technically an environmental hazard for you now. Try to stay vertical.\"\n\nI froze, one hand gripping the rough bark of a nearby sapling to steady myself. My palm stung. Even that tiny friction felt dangerous, like the bark was trying to sand down my existence. I looked down at my hands\u2014pale, trembling, and definitely not equipped for a world that wanted to kill me. \n\n\"You\u2019re kidding,\" I whispered, my voice cracking. \"One HP? I\u2019ve had papercuts more substantial than my entire life bar.\"\n\n\"Hey, you're the one who dumped everything into Crits,\" Fizz replied, not looking up from her book. \"The System just balanced the scales. You\u2019re the ultimate glass cannon, Artie. Minus the cannon part, for now. Right now, you\u2019re just the glass.\"\n\nI reached into my pocket, my fingers brushing against my Leather Wallet and the cold, jagged edges of my Keyring. They felt absurdly heavy. My keys\u2014the ones to an apartment I\u2019d never see again and a car that was probably being towed from the office parking lot\u2014were currently the most dangerous things I owned. If I fell on them, I was dead.\n\nA low, wet sound echoed through the clearing. It wasn't a growl, exactly. It was more like someone dropping a giant bowl of gelatin onto a marble floor. \n\n*Schlorp.*\n\nI turned my head slowly. Twenty feet away, the ferns parted. Emerging from the undergrowth was a creature that, in any other RPG, would have been the punchline of a tutorial joke. It was a translucent green blob, about the size of a beach ball, vibrating with a rhythmic intensity that made the grass beneath it quiver.\n\n[Lesser Forest Slime - Lvl 1]\n[HP: 10/10]\n\nA tiny, red health bar hovered over its jiggly head. It looked harmless. It looked like something you\u2019d find in a high-end candy store. But as it turned toward me, its entire body rippled, and I saw the way the acidic slime dissolved the fallen leaves in its path.\n\n\"Fizz,\" I said, my voice rising an octave. \"Tell me that thing is a passive mob.\"\n\n\"Let's see,\" Fizz hummed, finally closing her manual with a snap. She squinted at the slime. \"Lesser Forest Slime. Diet: organic matter, small rodents, and... oh, look at that. 'Unwary Level 1 Travelers.' It\u2019s an aggressive-type. It probably thinks you\u2019re a particularly crunchy snack.\"\n\nThe slime lunged. It didn't move fast, but it moved with a terrifying, mindless persistence. It compressed its body and then sprang forward, covering three feet in a single, wet hop.\n\n\"Move!\" Fizz chirped.\n\nI didn't need the prompt. I scrambled backward, my boots slipping on the mulch. Every step was a gamble. If I tripped, I died. If I hit a branch, I died. The world had become a minefield of mundane objects. I could feel the 'Fragile' status humming in my bones, a constant, low-frequency reminder that I was essentially made of fine china.\n\n[System Notification]\n[Title Active: Crit or Quit]\n[Effect: 100% Critical Hit Rate confirmed. Penalty: HP capped at 1/1.]\n\n\"I can't fight that thing!\" I yelled, backing away as the slime hopped again. *Schlorp.* It was closer now. I could see the bits of undigested twigs floating inside its translucent gut. \"I don't even have a sword! I have a rewards card for a sandwich shop and a set of house keys!\"\n\n\"Then use your keys!\" Fizz suggested, hovering just out of reach. \"You have a hundred percent crit rate, Artie. You could probably kill a god with a toothpick if you timed it right. Of course, the god would only have to sneeze on you to win, but that\u2019s the 'Quit' part of the title.\"\n\nThe slime hopped again, and this time, it was close enough that I could smell it\u2014a cloying, sweet scent like rotting peaches. It wasn't just a blob; it was a predator. Its surface tension rippled as it prepared for a larger leap.\n\nI backed up further, my heart hammering against my chest so hard I was afraid it would count as internal damage. My heel hit something solid. I glanced back.\n\nA massive, ancient oak tree blocked my path. Its roots were gnarled and thick, twisting out of the earth like petrified snakes. I was cornered. \n\nThe slime sensed it. It stopped five feet away, its body pulsing, glowing with a faint, sickly green light as it drew in air\u2014or whatever it used for breath\u2014to launch itself at my face.\n\n\"Okay, Penhaligon,\" I muttered to myself, my breath coming in shallow, ragged gasps. \"Think. You're a spreadsheet guy. You're a data analyst. This is just a hostile merger. With a giant grape.\"\n\nI reached into my right pocket and gripped my Keyring. I pulled it out, the metal jingling with a sound that felt like a funeral bell. I didn't have a shield. I didn't have armor. I had a 100% chance to do something spectacular, and a 100% chance to die if I messed it up.\n\nI dropped into a low, desperate crouch, my back pressed against the rough bark of the tree. I held the keys out in front of me like a dinky, silver dagger, my knuckles white. \n\n\"Come on, then,\" I snarled at the vibrating puddle of goo. \"Let's see if the math holds up.\"\n\nThe slime compressed itself into a flat pancake, then launched.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"CHAR_FIZZ\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"Tutorial Zone - Whispering Woods\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie and Fizz have arrived in the Whispering Woods.\",\n      \"Artie is being hunted by a Level 1 Lesser Forest Slime.\",\n      \"Artie has realized that his 1 HP status makes even the environment lethal.\",\n      \"Artie is backed against an oak tree, preparing to defend himself with his keys.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 3,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\n          \"item\": \"ITEM_WALLET_001\",\n          \"container\": \"pocket_left\",\n          \"status\": \"stowed\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"item\": \"ITEM_KEYS_001\",\n          \"container\": \"hand_right\",\n          \"status\": \"held\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\n          \"container\": \"pocket_left\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n          \"contents\": [\n            \"ITEM_WALLET_001\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"container\": \"pocket_right\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n          \"contents\": []\n        }\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie is experiencing acute survival anxiety due to his Fragile status.\",\n        \"Artie is beginning to view the world through the lens of tactical exploitation.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_FIZZ\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 3,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\n          \"item\": \"ITEM_GUIDE_BOOK_001\",\n          \"container\": \"hand_right\",\n          \"status\": \"held\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\n          \"container\": \"satchel\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_FIZZ\",\n          \"contents\": []\n        }\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Fizz is maintaining a detached, clinical observation of Artie's struggle.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"character_continuity_system_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"set\": {\n        \"stats\": {\n          \"hp\": {\n            \"current\": 1,\n            \"max\": 1\n          },\n          \"crit_rate\": 100,\n          \"level\": 1\n        },\n        \"statuses\": {\n          \"fragile\": \"Any damage taken is fatal.\"\n        },\n        \"titles\": [\n          {\n            \"id\": \"TITLE_CRIT_OR_QUIT\",\n            \"name\": \"Crit or Quit\",\n            \"source\": \"System Achievement\",\n            \"active\": true\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      \"reason\": \"Arrival in tutorial zone with locked build.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"inventory_alignment_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"item_id\": \"ITEM_KEYS_001\",\n      \"new_container\": \"hand_right\",\n      \"new_status\": \"held\",\n      \"reason\": \"Artie drew his keys to defend himself.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie and Fizz arrived in the Whispering Woods, where Artie immediately felt the physical weight of his 1 HP build.\",\n      \"A Level 1 Slime ambushed them, forcing Artie into a panicked retreat.\",\n      \"Artie ended the scene backed against a tree, wielding his house keys as a makeshift weapon against the lunging monster.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Artie transitioned to the Whispering Woods and confirmed the lethality of the 'Fragile' status.\",\n      \"A Level 1 Lesser Forest Slime appeared and targeted Artie.\",\n      \"Artie realized he has no traditional weapons and is forced to use his Keyring.\",\n      \"Artie was cornered against an ancient oak tree by the slime.\",\n      \"The slime initiated a leap attack against Artie.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"milestone: deployment_initiated = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: first_monster_encounter = DONE\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Keyring (held, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Leather Wallet (stowed, container=pocket_left)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_FIZZ -> Standard Guide's Manual (held, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"Artie's HP is 1/1 and he has the Fragile status.\",\n      \"milestone: build_locked = DONE\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Artie has entered the Whispering Woods and faced his first enemy, a Level 1 Slime, while possessing only 1 HP.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nItem naming: use display_name for prose; use item_id only in JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nIf mechanics are shown in prose or UI, they must be present in continuity system state or added in continuity system updates in the same STATE_PATCH.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the

No recap.\n- Summaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\n- Use the continuity pack and state for continuity.\n- Use character_registry to keep names consistent in prose.\n- Timeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\n- State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\n- Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n- Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\n- Inventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- For held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\n- Continuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates in this scene.\n- titles are arrays of objects with stable name fields; do not emit titles as plain strings.\n- Canonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\n- If item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for ownership/custody labels in authoritative outputs.\n- Use item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\n- If a required event is not in the Scene Card, do not perform it.\n- Enforce scene-card durable constraints: honor `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, and `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\n- Respect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope` when proposing durable mutations; do not mutate physical custody in non-present/non-real scope unless explicitly marked override.\n- summary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\n- STATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\n- If state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\n- Return prose plus a state_patch JSON block.\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n- All *_updates arrays must contain objects; never emit bare strings as array entries.\n- character_updates.containers must be an array of objects with at least: container, owner, contents (array).\n- Durable-state mutation blocks are mandatory when applicable:\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects; never an object with an `updates` field.\n- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.\n- If you mutate durable state, do not leave the same mutation only in prose.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n  - Each entry must include character_id, chapter, scene, inventory (full current list), containers (full current list), invariants_add (array), persona_updates (array).\n  - character_updates.inventory MUST be an array of objects, never string item ids.\n  - Inventory object shape: {\"item\": \"ITEM_or_name\", \"container\": \"hand_left|hand_right|<container>\", \"status\": \"held|carried|equipped|stowed\"}.\n  - Container object shape: {\"container\": \"<name>\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_id\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_id\", \"...\"]}.\n  - If you have a single persona update, still wrap it in an array of strings.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger and invariants using standard phrasing, e.g.:\n  - Avoid numeric mechanics in must_stay_true; store them in continuity system updates instead.\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> shard (carried, container=satchel)\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> longsword (carried, container=hand_right)\n  - container: satchel (owner=CHAR_example, contents=[shard, maps])\n  - milestone: shard_bind = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - milestone: maps_acquired = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - injury: right forearm scar / left arm filament\n  - ownership: shard (carried) / shard (bound but physical)\n\nScene card:\n{\n  \"cast_present\": [\n    \"Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon\",\n    \"Fizz\"\n  ],\n  \"cast_present_ids\": [\n    \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n    \"CHAR_FIZZ\"\n  ],\n  \"chapter\": 1,\n  \"conflict\": \"Artie's instinct to flee vs. the slow, inevitable approach of a Level 1 Slime.\",\n  \"constraints\": [\n    \"target_words: 2000\",\n    \"no-recaps\",\n    \"forward-motion\"\n  ],\n  \"continuity_system_focus\": [\n    \"stats\",\n    \"statuses\"\n  ],\n  \"device_presence\": [],\n  \"end_condition\": \"Artie is backed against a tree by the slime, forced into a combat stance.\",\n  \"forbidden_visible\": [],\n  \"goal\": \"Establish the immediate, lethal stakes of Artie's fragile build.\",\n  \"introduces\": [],\n  \"introduces_ids\": [],\n  \"ontological_scope\": \"real\",\n  \"required_callbacks\": [\n    \"milestone: deployment_initiated\",\n    \"TITLE_CRIT_OR_QUIT\"\n  ],\n  \"required_in_custody\": [\n    \"ITEM_WALLET_001\",\n    \"ITEM_KEYS_001\"\n  ],\n  \"required_scene_accessible\": [\n    \"ITEM_WALLET_001\",\n    \"ITEM_KEYS_001\"\n  ],\n  \"required_visible_on_page\": [],\n  \"scene\": 3,\n  \"scene_id\": \"SC_001_003\",\n  \"scene_target\": \"Artie realizes that in this world, '1 HP' means a stiff breeze could kill him.\",\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.1\",\n  \"thread_ids\": [],\n  \"timeline_scope\": \"present\",\n  \"transition_type\": \"travel_arrival\",\n  \"ui_mechanics_expected\": [\n    \"HP\",\n    \"Fragile Status\",\n    \"Level\"\n  ]\n}\n\nContinuity pack:\n{\n  \"cast_present\": [\n    \"Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon\",\n    \"Fizz\"\n  ],\n  \"constraints\": [\n    \"Artie's HP is permanently locked at 1/1.\",\n    \"Artie's Critical Hit Rate is 100%.\",\n    \"Artie's Smartphone (ITEM_SMARTPHONE_001) is located on the office breakroom floor.\",\n    \"milestone: build_locked = DONE\",\n    \"milestone: deployment_initiated = DONE\",\n    \"Artie has the 'Crit or Quit' title.\",\n    \"Leather Wallet (ITEM_WALLET_001) is stowed in Artie's pocket_left.\",\n    \"Keyring (ITEM_KEYS_001) is stowed in Artie's pocket_right.\",\n    \"Fizz has her Standard Guide's Manual (ITEM_GUIDE_BOOK_001) held in her hand_right.\"\n  ],\n  \"location\": \"Tutorial Zone - Whispering Woods\",\n  \"next_action\": \"Artie must confront a Level 1 Slime while ensuring he takes zero damage due to his Fragile status.\",\n  \"open_threads\": [\n    \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"\n  ],\n  \"scene_end_anchor\": \"Artie Penhaligon finalized his character build in the Character Creation Suite, resulting in a locked 1 HP and 100% Critical Hit Rate.

anchor:\nThe slime didn't just wobble; it vibrated with the rhythmic intensity of a subwoofer in a teenager\u2019s trunk. I checked the floating red bar hovering above its translucent, jiggly head. \n\n[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 3] [HP: 45/45]\n\nForty-five health. At my current Strength of 12, with a base weapon damage of 4-6, I was looking at a nine-hit kill minimum, assuming the RNG gods didn't decide to spit on my shoes today. \n\n\"You know,\" I said, adjusting my grip on the rusted shortsword. \"In most worlds, puddles are for stepping in, not for getting dissolved by.\"\n\nThe slime responded by launching a glob of corrosive mucus. I rolled left, the grass staining my knees.\n\n[Stamina: 88/100]\n\n\"Missed me. Barely. That\u2019s a three-second cooldown on your spit, isn't it?\"\n\nI didn't wait for the confirmation. I lunged. The blade sank into the gelatinous mass with a sound like a heavy boot pulling out of thick mud.\n\n[Critical Hit! -14 HP]\n\n\"There we go. Who needs luck when you have math?\"\n\nThe slime shuddered, its HP bar dipping into the yellow. \n\n[HP: 31/45]\n\n\"One more of those and we can talk about your retirement plan,\" I muttered. My lungs burned slightly, a reminder that my Agility was still garbage. \n\n[Passive Skill Gained: Basic Analysis (Rank F)]\n[Description: You can see basic stats and cooldowns of enemies within 5 meters. You\u2019ve stopped guessing and started counting. Good for you.]\n\n\"Finally,\" I breathed, dodging another glob. \"The ding is coming. I can practically taste the experience points. They taste like copper and bad decisions.\" \n\nI swung again, the numbers popping in the air like neon confetti. This wasn't just a fight; it was a grind. And in this world, the grind was the only thing that kept you from becoming part of the scenery.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n
