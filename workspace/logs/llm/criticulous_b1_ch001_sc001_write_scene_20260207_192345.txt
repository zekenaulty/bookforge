PROSE:

The Zesty Ranch Zings were mocking him. 

They hung there, suspended by a literal sliver of crinkled plastic, dangling over the edge of the metal coil like a suicidal mountain climber who had second thoughts at the very last second. Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stared through the smudged glass of the breakroom vending machine, his breath fogging the surface. 

"You’ve got to be kidding me," Artie muttered. He checked the screen. *CREDIT: $0.00*.

He looked down at his right hand, which was currently occupied by a smartphone so dead it hadn't even shown a low-battery icon in three hours. It was a glass-and-silicon brick, a useless weight that matched the general vibe of his Tuesday afternoon. He shoved the phone into his pocket—no, wait, his pocket was already overflowing with the various detritus of a man who had forgotten to do laundry for two weeks. He felt the familiar, scratchy texture of a significant amount of pocket lint.

[Status Effect: Caffeine Withdrawal - Level 4]
[Status Effect: Low Blood Sugar - Irritability +15%]

Artie didn't actually see those floating text boxes yet, but he felt them in the marrow of his bones. He was a level zero office drone in a world that rewarded patience with spreadsheets and loyalty with lukewarm coffee.

"Come on, you piece of junk," Artie said, slapping the side of the machine. The Snack-O-Matic 3000 rattled, its internal coils humming with a low-frequency buzz that sounded suspiciously like a mechanical snicker. The bag of Zesty Ranch Zings didn't budge. It just swayed, teasing him with the promise of MSG and artificial buttermilk flavoring.

He checked his surroundings. The breakroom was empty, save for a half-empty carafe of "Morning Blend" that had likely been brewed during the Bush administration and a single, depressing motivational poster of a cat clinging to a branch. The cat looked like it had given up years ago. Artie knew the feeling.

"Right," Artie whispered, rolling up his sleeves. "Tactical intervention."

He gripped the top corners of the machine. According to the office lore passed down by the senior account managers, a precise rhythmic tilt could dislodge even the most stubborn of snacks. It was a high-risk, high-reward maneuver. If he tilted too far, he’d be crushed by three hundred pounds of refrigerated sugar. If he didn't tilt enough, he’d just look like a man trying to slow-dance with a robot.

He heaved. The machine groaned.

"One... two..."

On three, he gave it a sharp, authoritative shove. The Snack-O-Matic rocked back on its rear legs. For a glorious, shimmering second, gravity took hold. The Zesty Ranch Zings slipped. They began to fall.

And then, the world decided to remind Artie that he had a Luck stat of approximately zero.

The machine didn't just settle back into place. As it slammed forward, the internal wiring—frayed by years of neglect and a questionable repair job involving duct tape and a paperclip—decided to give up the ghost. A surge of raw, unadulterated electricity, fed by a faulty circuit breaker and a sudden spike in the building’s power grid, surged through the metal chassis.

Artie’s hands were still firmly planted on the frame.

*CRACK-THOOM.*

The sound was less like an electrical pop and more like a localized thunderclap. Blue light, jagged and hungry, arced across Artie’s vision. He felt a sensation like being hit by a freight train made of needles. His muscles locked. His heart, usually a reliable if somewhat sluggish organ, decided to take an indefinite sabbatical.

*Oh,* Artie thought, the logic center of his brain functioning for one final, crystal-clear millisecond. *I’m dying over a bag of chips. This is going to be a very embarrassing obituary.*

The smell of ozone and burnt polyester filled the air. Artie felt himself being flung backward, his feet leaving the linoleum floor. The world didn't fade to black; it shattered into a million glowing pixels. The fluorescent lights of the breakroom stretched into infinity, becoming long ribbons of white fire. 

He hit the ground, but he didn't feel the impact. He didn't feel the cold floor or the lingering sting of the shock. He felt... nothing. A profound, weightless emptiness swallowed him whole. The hum of the vending machine vanished, replaced by a silence so absolute it was deafening.

He was floating in a void. No up, no down, no Zesty Ranch Zings. Just a vast, shimmering expanse of darkness that felt less like death and more like a loading screen.

Artie tried to scream, but he had no lungs. He tried to look at his hands, but he was just a flickering spark of consciousness in the dark. 

Then, the silence broke.

A chime, melodic and irritatingly cheerful, echoed through the emptiness. It was the sound of a successful boot-up sequence. 

In the center of his non-existent vision, a box of glowing blue light materialized.

[System Notification]
[Critical Error Detected: Player 'Arthur Penhaligon' has experienced a fatal hardware failure (Heart.exe stopped responding).]

"Hardware failure?" Artie’s thought-voice echoed. "I was electrocuted by a Snack-O-Matic!"

[Analyzing cause of death...]
[Result: Death by Ranch-Induced Electrocution. Magnitude: Pathetic.]

"Hey!"

[Calculating Soul-Value...]
[Error: Statistical Anomaly Detected.]
[RNG-Seed corrupted by extreme proximity to high-voltage snack distribution.]

The blue box flickered, turning a violent shade of crimson before settling back into a steady, pulsing gold.

[Initialization Sequence Commencing...]
[Welcome to the System, Arthur. Try not to die immediately this time.]

Artie’s consciousness began to stretch, pulled by an invisible force toward a pinprick of light in the distance. The void was ending. The game was beginning.

[Current HP: 0/100]
[Status: Deceased (Pending Reboot)]

The light expanded, blinding and absolute, and Artie felt himself falling once more—not into the breakroom, but into something much, much worse.
