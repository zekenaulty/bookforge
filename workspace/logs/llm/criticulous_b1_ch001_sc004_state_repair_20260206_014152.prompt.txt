# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.

# STATE REPAIR

You are the state repair step. You must output a corrected STATE_PATCH JSON only.
No prose, no commentary, no code fences.

Goal:
- Ensure state_patch fully and accurately captures the scene's events and outcomes.
- Fill missing summary_update data and fix invalid formats from draft_patch.
- Preserve state invariants; do not contradict must_stay_true.

Rules:
- Output a single JSON object that matches the state_patch schema.
- Use schema_version "1.0".
- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for world_updates.cast_present.
- Use scene_card.thread_ids for world_updates.open_threads.
- Do not invent new character or thread ids.
- summary_update arrays are required: last_scene (2-4 sentences), key_events (3-7 bullets), must_stay_true (3-7 bullets), chapter_so_far_add (bullets).
- If an event appears in prose, it must appear in key_events.
- must_stay_true must include milestone ledger entries and any inventory/injury/ownership invariants implied by prose.
- character_updates entries must use arrays: persona_updates (array), invariants_add (array).

Inputs
- prose: final scene text
- state: pre-scene state
- draft_patch: patch returned by write/repair (may be incomplete)
- continuity_pack: pre-write continuity pack
- character_states: current cast-only character state

Prose:
The Level 1 Lesser Forest Slime was, by all reasonable metrics of biological classification, a joke. It was a translucent, lime-green wobbling mass that looked like it had been harvested from the bottom of a cafeteria Jell-O tray. It didn't have teeth, it didn't have claws, and it moved with the urgent speed of a glacier on a coffee break. But to Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon, this wobbling puddle of citrus-flavored malice was the Grim Reaper in gelatinous form.

Artie’s back was pressed hard against the rough, furrowed bark of a massive oak tree. The tree was a titan of the Tutorial Zone, its branches sprawling like the veins of the earth against the digital blue of the sky. It felt solid. It felt permanent. It was the only thing keeping Artie from collapsing into a heap of existential dread.

The floating red text above the creature was a death sentence. Artie looked down at his own status bar, hovering in the periphery of his vision like a nagging headache.

[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[HP: 1/1]

"Two damage," Artie whispered, his voice cracking. "It does two damage. I have one hit point. I am literally a soap bubble in a world made of needles."

The slime rippled. A wet, rhythmic *thwack-thwack-thwack* echoed through the clearing as it compressed its body, preparing to lunge. Artie gripped the hilt of his weapon. The Rusty Shortsword (Prop) felt exactly like what its name suggested: a piece of painted plastic and cheap foam that had been left in a damp basement for a decade. The 'Prop' tag wasn't just a descriptor; it was a warning that the System didn't consider this a real weapon.

"Okay, Artie. You were a data analyst. You deal in probabilities. You have a one-hundred percent critical hit rate. The math is on your side," he lied to himself. His palms were sweating, making the grip of the sword slick and unreliable. "You just have to touch it. One touch, and the math does the rest."

The slime launched. It didn't so much leap as it did undergo a sudden, violent change in state from 'puddle' to 'projectile.' It sailed through the air, a wobbling green sphere of doom aimed directly at Artie’s chest.

"Get back!" Artie roared, swinging the rusted blade in a wide, desperate arc.

The sword whistled through the air. Artie felt the weight of the swing, saw the blade pass directly through the center of the slime’s translucent mass. He braced for the impact, for the spray of green goo, for the sweet satisfaction of a kill.

[Miss!]

The word appeared in bright, mocking yellow text right where the slime should have been. The creature sailed past Artie’s shoulder, its sticky surface missing his tunic by a fraction of an inch. It hit the ground with a sound like a wet beanbag and immediately began to turn around.

"What? I hit that! I saw the blade go through it!" Artie screamed at the sky. "The collision detection in this place is garbage! I want to speak to a developer!"

The System did not respond with a developer. It responded with the slime compressing itself again.

Artie didn't wait for the next lunge. He stepped forward, determined to end this before his heart gave out from sheer terror. He raised the sword high above his head and brought it down in a vertical chop, a move he’d seen a thousand times in RPGs. The slime was stationary, recovering from its landing. It was a sitting duck. A sitting lime.

[Miss!]

The sword didn't hit the slime. It didn't even hit the ground where the slime was. Instead, the blade seemed to deflect off an invisible curved surface, sliding to the left and burying itself deep into a protruding root of the oak tree. The jar of the impact traveled up Artie’s arm, making his elbow scream in protest.

"Two!" Artie gasped, tugging at the sword. It was stuck. "That’s two! How can I miss a target that isn't even moving? I’m standing right on top of it!"

The slime didn't care about his frustrations. It lunged again, this time aiming for his knees. Artie panicked, yanking the sword free with a burst of adrenaline-fueled strength and jumping backward. He swung the blade blindly as he moved, a horizontal lash meant to keep the monster at bay.

[Miss!]

The slime flattened itself into a pancake, the rusted metal passing harmlessly over its gelatinous 'head.' It looked up at him—or at least, it oriented its mass toward him—with what Artie could only interpret as smug satisfaction.

"Three," Artie whimpered. He was breathing hard now, the air in the Tutorial Zone tasting like ozone and pine needles. "The System is rigging the rolls. It has to be. It gave me the crit rate, but it’s nerfing my accuracy to compensate. It’s a balance patch in real-time!"

He was backed against the tree again. The slime was circling him now, its movements becoming more fluid, more confident. It knew he was a glass cannon. It knew that one mistake, one slip of the foot, and Arthur Penhaligon would be a memory.

The slime launched a fourth time. It was a high, looping jump, designed to come down on Artie from above. He saw it coming. He timed it. He lunged forward with a thrust, aiming the tip of the 'Prop' sword at the very center of the falling green mass.

[Miss!]

The sword slid off the slime’s side as if the creature were coated in industrial-grade Teflon. The momentum carried Artie forward, and he nearly face-planted into the grass. He scrambled back to the tree, his legs shaking.

"Four! That’s four misses!" he yelled, his voice rising to a hysterical pitch. "I am a statistical impossibility! I am the one-percent of the one-percent! I am the king of the whiff!"

The slime was preparing its final assault. It began to vibrate, its green hue deepening to a dark, bruised emerald. The ground beneath it seemed to hum with gathered energy. This wasn't just a lunge; it was a 'Heavy Attack.'

Artie looked at the sword. It was a joke. He looked at the slime. It was a killer. He looked at the oak tree. It was a witness.

"One more," Artie whispered. "Just give me one hit."

The slime exploded off the ground. It moved faster than before, a blur of green malice. Artie swung with everything he had left. He didn't aim for the center. He didn't aim for the edges. He just swung at the space where the monster was.

[Miss!]

The sword hit a low-hanging branch of the oak tree, snapping it clean off. The branch fell, bouncing off Artie’s shoulder and landing in the dirt. It didn't do damage, but it was the final, crushing weight on his spirit.

"Five," Artie said, his eyes wide. The slime was inches from his face, its translucent body expanding as it prepared to engulf him. "I missed five times. This is it. I’m going to be killed by a dessert."

Time slowed down. It was a classic trope, the moment of clarity before the end. He could see the individual air bubbles trapped inside the slime. He could see the way the sunlight refracted through its body, casting a green glow on his own terrified face. He could see the 'Attack: 2' text hovering like a neon sign.

And then, something in the back of Artie’s mind—the part that had spent years analyzing spreadsheets and finding the one outlier in a sea of data—clicked.

The 100% Critical Hit Rate wasn't a stat. It was a law. And the System, for all its snark and its 'Prop' swords, was bound by its own laws. The misses weren't failures of skill; they were the System trying to delay the inevitable. But the math had reached its limit. The probability had collapsed into a single, unavoidable point.

Artie didn't swing. He didn't even move his arm. He just let his wrist twitch. A tiny, insignificant flick of the rusted blade. A glitch in the animation of his own despair.

The tip of the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) touched the very edge of the slime.

The world didn't just end; it was rewritten.

[SUPER-MEGA-ULTRA-CRIT!]

The sound was not a physical noise. It was the sound of a billion calculators screaming in unison. A pillar of pure, blinding golden light erupted from the point of contact, a column of celestial fire that reached from the scorched grass to the very top of the skybox.

The Level 1 Lesser Forest Slime didn't die. It didn't even have time to trigger a death animation. It was simply deleted. Its pixels were torn apart, its data scrubbed from the local memory, its very existence turned into a cloud of glowing green vapor that was instantly incinerated by the heat of the crit.

But the crit wasn't satisfied with one level-one mob.

The energy wave hit the oak tree. The hundred-year-old giant, the titan of the Tutorial Zone, vanished. There was no sound of splintering wood, no groan of falling timber. There was only a roar of displaced air as the tree was reduced to ash and light in a fraction of a second. The shockwave expanded, carving a perfect, circular crater into the earth, twenty feet wide and ten feet deep. The edges of the pit were glassed, glowing with a dull, angry red heat.

Artie was thrown backward, but the System’s physics—or perhaps its sheer confusion—kept him on his feet. He stood on the edge of the smoking ruin, his arm still raised, the 'Prop' sword glowing with a faint, dying ember of gold.

Silence returned to the forest. It was a heavy, unnatural silence, broken only by the sound of a few stray leaves that had survived the blast fluttering down into the crater.

Then, the notifications began to scroll.

[System Notification]
[Target: Lesser Forest Slime (Lvl 1) - DEFEATED]
[Damage Dealt: 9,999,999 (Overkill)]

[Stat Points Gained: 5]
[Note: Please try to leave some of the environment for the other players. The janitorial sub-routines are complaining about the sudden increase in 'Ash-Related' tickets.]

Artie stood there, his mouth hanging open. He looked at the crater. He looked at the empty space where a massive tree had been seconds ago. He looked at the sword in his hand, which was still rusted, still cheap, and still labeled as a 'Prop.'

"I..." Artie started, his voice a dry, hacking rasp. He swallowed hard. "I think I might be a little bit broken."

He checked his status bar.

[HP: 1/1]
[Level: 2]

He was still one stiff breeze away from death. He was still a glass cannon. But he had just deleted a piece of the world's geometry because he’d finally stopped missing.

"Level two," he breathed, a hysterical, high-pitched laugh bubbling up in his throat. "I’m level two. And all it took was the total destruction of a local ecosystem."

He sat down on the edge of the crater, his legs finally giving out. The dirt was still warm, the heat seeping through his trousers. He reached into his pocket, feeling the familiar, comforting weight of his dead smartphone and his wallet. They were relics of a world where slimes didn't exist and trees didn't turn into light.

"Okay," Artie said to the empty, smoking clearing. "If that was a level one slime... I really, really need to find some armor that isn't made of 'Prop' material. Or maybe a shield. A very, very big shield."

He looked at the sword. In his hands, it no longer felt like a toy. It felt like a detonator.

"One hit," he muttered, his eyes reflecting the dying glow of the crater. "One hit is all it takes. Now I just have to figure out how to not miss the next five times."

The sun continued to shine, the birds (the ones that hadn't been vaporized) began to chirp again, and Arthur Penhaligon, the Level 2 Glass Cannon, began to plan his next move in a world that was clearly not prepared for his arrival.
