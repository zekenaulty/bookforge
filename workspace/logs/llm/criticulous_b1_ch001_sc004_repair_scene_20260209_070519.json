His heart was doing a frantic drum solo against his ribs, a reminder that his current HP was exactly one. If a stray breeze carried too much pollen, he was reasonably certain the System would categorize it as a lethal status effect.\n\n\"Okay, Artie. Think. It\u2019s just physics and bad programming,\" he muttered, his fingers white-knuckled around the metal loop of his Keyring. The Honda Civic keys dangled like the world\u2019s saddest flail. \"I have a hundred percent crit rate. I just need to touch it. One tap, and the math does the rest.\"\n\nThe slime lunged. It didn\u2019t crawl; it launched itself like a glob of radioactive snot. Artie swung the keys with a desperate, uncoordinated yelp.\n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe slime flattened itself against the grass, the metal teeth of the house keys whistling through the empty air where its \"head\" had been a microsecond before. Artie stumbled, his lack of coordination sending him teetering toward the very thing that wanted to dissolve his shins.\n\n\"Right. Agility of a sedentary potato. Noted,\" he wheezed, scrambling to reset his stance.\n\nThe creature recoiled, its gelatinous body shivering as it prepared for a second pass. It looked like it was laughing at him. Artie didn't blame it; he was a grown man in a business-casual button-down trying to fight a puddle with a grocery store loyalty card.\n\nIt hopped again. He swung low this time, aiming for the base.\n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe slime performed a graceful, mid-air pirouette. It sailed over his hand, landing with a wet thwack just inches from his left shoe. Artie jumped back, nearly tripping over a protruding root.\n\n[Warning: HP 1/1. Any contact will result in immediate character deletion.]\n\n\"I know! I'm working on it!\" Artie shouted at the floating red text. \n\nHe tried a tactical thrust. It was a move he\u2019d seen in a dozen movies, a sharp jab intended to puncture. \n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe slime didn't even move this time. It just shifted. A hole opened up in the center of its mass, and Artie's hand passed straight through the gap. The metal keys clattered against each other, ringing out in the quiet woods like a dinner bell for his own funeral. He yanked his arm back before the hole could close around his wrist.\n\n\"Three misses,\" he panted. \"The RNG gods aren't even spitting on me. They\u2019re just ignoring my existence.\"\n\nThe slime was getting bolder. It began to circle him, its green surface darkening. It was charging up. Artie could see the internal pressure building, the slime becoming more opaque as it prepared a high-velocity strike. He lunged forward, trying to catch it off-balance.\n\n[Miss!]\n\nHis foot slipped on a patch of damp moss. Instead of a heroic strike, he performed a rhythmic flail that ended with him hugging the ancient oak tree for dear life. The slime didn't even have to dodge; he\u2019d missed by a solid three feet.\n\n\"This is it,\" Artie whispered, watching the slime coil itself into a tight, vibrating spring. \"I\u2019m going to be the first person in history to be killed by a Level 1 tutorial mob while having a literal cheat-code build.\"\n\nThe slime launched. It was a green blur, a projectile of pure aggression. Artie didn't think. He didn't aim. He just closed his eyes and swung his right hand in a wide, panicked arc, the Keyring trailing behind like a comet of silver and plastic.\n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe keys hit the air. The slime sailed past his ear. He felt the rush of wind, the cold sensation of death missing him by a fraction of an inch. That was five. Five misses. He was a statistical impossibility of failure.\n\nBut as he swung, his momentum carried him around. He was spinning, a human top of pure incompetence. His hand, still clutching the keys, slammed into the trunk of the ancient oak tree. Except, it didn't just hit the tree. The edge of his thumb\u2014just a tiny sliver of skin\u2014brushed against the trailing edge of the slime as it tried to recover from its leap.\n\nThe world turned white.\n\n[SYSTEM ALERT: CRITICAL HIT!]\n[CALCULATING DAMAGE...]\n[ERROR: CRIT RATE 100% DETECTED]\n[ERROR: NESTED MULTIPLIER DETECTED]\n[ERROR: MATH.EXE HAS ENCOUNTERED A PROBLEM]\n[SUPER-MEGA-ULTRA-CRIT!]\n\nA sound like a thunderclap inside a library shattered the silence of the Whispering Woods. A pillar of pure, incandescent light erupted from the point of contact. It wasn't just a hit; it was a localized apocalypse. Artie felt a shockwave ripple through his arm, but it didn't hurt. It felt like static, as if his entire body was being recalculated in real-time. \n\nWhen the light faded, the slime was gone. It wasn't dead; it was deleted. There wasn't even a stain on the grass. \n\nBut it wasn't just the slime. The ancient oak tree\u2014the massive, multi-ton landmark Artie had been cornered against\u2014was gone. In its place was a perfectly circular, cauterized crater that extended twenty feet into the forest floor. The upper branches of the neighboring trees were smoldering, their leaves turned to ash by the sheer thermal output of a single, accidental punch.\n\nArtie stood there, his hand still extended, clutching a Keyring that was now glowing with a faint, dying ember of blue light.\n\n[System Notification]\n[Target: Lesser Forest Slime (Lvl 1) - OBLITERATED]\n[Damage Dealt: 9,999,999 (Overkill)]\n[Experience Gained: 150 (Tutorial Bonus Applied)]\n\n[LEVEL UP!]\n[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon: Level 1 -> Level 2]\n\n[Stat Points Awarded: 5]\n[Current HP: 1/1 (Fixed)]\n\nArtie stared at the crater. Then he looked at his keys. The plastic fob for his local gym had melted into a shapeless blob, but the keys themselves were fine. \n\n\"Well,\" he said, his voice cracking. \"At least I don't have to worry about the tree anymore.\"\n\nHe checked his status window. The '1/1' next to his HP was still there, mocking him in bright, neon red. Level 2 didn't change the fact that a stiff breeze could end his journey, but it did mean the System was officially tracking his carnage.\n\n\"Fizz?\" he called out, looking around the smoking ruin of the tutorial zone. \"I think I broke the woods.\"\n\nThere was no answer, just the sound of falling ash and the distant, confused chirping of birds that had somehow survived the math-based explosion.

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nItem naming: use display_name for prose; use item_id only in JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nIf mechanics are shown in prose or UI, they must be present in continuity system state or added in continuity system updates in the same STATE_PATCH.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the

If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\nFor held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\nContinuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nCanonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\nIf item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for authoritative labels and custody terms.\nUse item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nsummary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\nSTATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\nmust_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\nIf state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\nEnforce scene-card durable constraints: `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\nRespect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`; avoid physical durable custody changes in non-present/non-real scope unless explicit override is present.\nReturn corrected prose plus a corrected state_patch JSON block.\n\nOutput format (required, no code fences, no commentary):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n- All *_updates arrays must contain objects;

Forest Slime didn\u2019t have a face, but it definitely had an attitude. It jiggled with a predatory rhythm, its translucent green mass pulsing like a neon stress ball filled with spite. \n\n[Lesser Forest Slime - Lvl 1] [HP: 10/10]\n\nI backed up until the rough, gnarled bark of the ancient oak tree bit into my shoulder blades. My heart was doing a frantic drum solo against my ribs, a reminder that my current HP was exactly one. If a stray breeze carried too much pollen, I was pretty sure the System would consider it a lethal status effect.\n\n\"Okay, Artie. Think. It\u2019s just physics and bad programming,\" I muttered, my fingers white-knuckled around the metal loop of my Keyring. My Honda Civic keys dangled like the world\u2019s saddest flail. \"I have a hundred percent crit rate. I just need to touch it. One tap, and the math does the rest.\"\n\nThe slime lunged. It didn\u2019t crawl; it launched itself like a glob of radioactive snot.\n\nI swung the keys with a desperate, uncoordinated yelp.\n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe slime flattened itself against the grass, the metal teeth of my house keys whistling through the empty air where its \"head\" had been a microsecond before. I stumbled, my balance\u2014or lack thereof\u2014sending me teetering toward the very thing that wanted to dissolve my shins.\n\n\"Right. Agility of a sedentary potato. Noted,\" I wheezed, scrambling to reset my stance.\n\nThe creature recoiled, its gelatinous body shivering as it prepared for a second pass. It looked like it was laughing at me. I didn't blame it. I was a grown man in a business-casual button-down trying to fight a puddle with a grocery store loyalty card.\n\nIt hopped again. I swung low this time, aiming for the base.\n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe slime performed a graceful, mid-air pirouette that would have made a gymnast weep. It sailed over my hand, landing with a wet *thwack* just inches from my left shoe. I jumped back, nearly tripping over a protruding root.\n\n[Warning: HP 1/1. Any contact will result in immediate character deletion.]\n\n\"I know! I'm working on it!\" I shouted at the floating red text. \n\nI tried a tactical thrust. It was a move I\u2019d seen in a dozen movies, a sharp jab intended to puncture. \n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe slime didn't even move this time. It just... shifted. A hole opened up in the center of its mass, and my hand passed straight through the gap. The metal keys clattered against each other, ringing out in the quiet woods like a dinner bell for my own funeral. I yanked my arm back before the hole could close around my wrist.\n\n\"Three misses,\" I panted. \"The RNG gods aren't even spitting on me. They\u2019re just ignoring my existence.\"\n\nThe slime was getting bolder. It began to circle me, its green surface darkening. It was charging up. I could see the internal pressure building, the slime becoming more opaque as it prepared a high-velocity strike.\n\nI lunged forward, trying to catch it off-balance.\n\n[Miss!]\n\nMy foot slipped on a patch of damp moss. Instead of a heroic strike, I performed a rhythmic flail that ended with me hugging the ancient oak tree for dear life. The slime didn't even have to dodge; I\u2019d missed by a solid three feet.\n\n\"This is it,\" I whispered, watching the slime coil itself into a tight, vibrating spring. \"I\u2019m going to be the first person in history to be killed by a Level 1 tutorial mob while having a literal cheat-code build.\"\n\nThe slime launched. It was a green blur, a projectile of pure aggression.\n\nI didn't think. I didn't aim. I just closed my eyes and swung my right hand in a wide, panicked arc, the Keyring trailing behind like a comet of silver and plastic.\n\n[Miss!]\n\nThe keys hit the air. The slime sailed past my ear. I felt the rush of wind, the cold sensation of death missing me by a fraction of an inch. That was five. Five misses. I was a statistical impossibility of failure.\n\nBut as I swung, my momentum carried me around. I was spinning, a human top of pure incompetence. My hand, still clutching the keys, slammed into the trunk of the ancient oak tree. \n\nExcept, it didn't just hit the tree. \n\nThe edge of my thumb\u2014just a tiny sliver of skin\u2014brushed against the trailing edge of the slime as it tried to recover from its leap.\n\nThe world turned white.\n\n[SYSTEM ALERT: CRITICAL HIT!]\n[CALCULATING DAMAGE...]\n[ERROR: CRIT RATE 100% DETECTED]\n[ERROR: NESTED MULTIPLIER DETECTED]\n[ERROR: MATH.EXE HAS ENCOUNTERED A PROBLEM]\n[SUPER-MEGA-ULTRA-CRIT!]\n\nA sound like a thunderclap inside a library shattered the silence of the Whispering Woods. A pillar of pure, incandescent light erupted from the point of contact. It wasn't just a hit; it was a localized apocalypse. \n\nI felt a shockwave ripple through my arm, but it didn't hurt. It felt like... static. Like my entire body was being recalculated in real-time. \n\nWhen the light faded, the slime was gone. It wasn't dead; it was deleted. There wasn't even a stain on the grass. \n\nBut it wasn't just the slime. \n\nThe ancient oak tree\u2014the massive, multi-ton landmark I had been cornered against\u2014was gone. In its place was a perfectly circular, cauterized crater that extended twenty feet into the forest floor. The upper branches of the neighboring trees were smoldering, their leaves turned to ash by the sheer thermal output of a single, accidental punch.\n\nI stood there, my hand still extended, clutching a Keyring that was now glowing with a faint, dying ember of blue light.\n\n[System Notification]\n[Target: Lesser Forest Slime (Lvl 1) - OBLITERATED]\n[Damage Dealt: 9,999,999 (Overkill)]\n[Experience Gained: 150 (Tutorial Bonus Applied)]\n\n[LEVEL UP!]\n[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon: Level 1 -> Level 2]\n\n[Stat Points Awarded: 5]\n[Current HP: 1/1 (Fixed)]\n\nI stared at the crater. Then I looked at my keys. The plastic fob for my local gym had melted into a shapeless blob, but the keys themselves were fine. \n\n\"Well,\" I said, my voice cracking. \"At least I don't have to worry about the tree anymore.\"\n\nI checked my status window. The '1/1' next to my HP was still there, mocking me in bright, neon red. Level 2 didn't change the fact that a stiff breeze could end my journey, but it did mean the System was officially tracking my carnage.\n\n\"Fizz?\" I called out, looking around the smoking ruin of the tutorial zone. \"I think I broke the woods.\"\n\nThere was no answer, just the sound of falling ash and the distant, confused chirping of birds that had somehow survived the math-based explosion. \n\nI looked down at my hand. My thumb was fine. Not a scratch. The 100% Crit Rate hadn't just made me powerful; it had turned me into a walking glitch. And if a Level 1 slime caused this much damage, I was terrified to see what would happen when I actually tried to hit something on purpose.\n\n[Title Progress: Anomaly - 1%]\n\n\"Great,\" I muttered, wiping soot off my shirt. \"I'm not a hero.
