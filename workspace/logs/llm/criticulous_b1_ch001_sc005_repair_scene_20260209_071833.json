Artie Penhaligon stood at the center of a twenty-foot cauterized circle, his boots crunching on what used to be a very respectable, very ancient oak tree. Now, it was just carbon and regret. He looked down at his right hand, where his Keyring was still white-knuckled in his grip. The brass teeth of his house keys were slightly bent, humming with a residual heat that suggested they weren't designed for multi-million-damage output.\n\n\"Well,\" Fizz said, her voice cutting through the ringing in his ears. She was hovering three feet to his left, her Standard Guide's Manual open to a page that was vibrating with frantic, golden text. \"That was... statistically improbable.\"\n\n\"Improbable?\" Artie\u2019s voice was a dry rasp. He didn't dare move.

It featured a small, plastic-looking figure of a man tripping over his own feet while holding a giant '1'. \n\n\"A trophy?\" Artie hoisted the thing. It was surprisingly heavy. \"Is this a joke?

He shoved his Keyring into his pocket\u2014nearly stabbing himself in the thigh in his haste\u2014and gripped the Participation Trophy like a football. He scrambled out of the crater, his lungs already burning. \n\nBehind them, the treeline erupted. A dozen Lesser Forest Slimes, normally slow and passive, were moving with terrifying speed, their gelatinous bodies undulating toward the glowing yellow light of the trophy. Above them, a pack of Shadow-Stalking Wolves crested a ridge, their eyes locked onto Artie with a hunger that suggested he was the only steak in a world of salad.\n\n\"Why is it glowing?!\" Artie yelled, leaping over a fallen log. \n\n[System Message: 'Look At Me!' effect is active.]\n[Visual Indicator: Neon Yellow Aura (Visible from Orbit)]\n\n\"Because the System hates you!\" Fizz screamed, flying backward to keep an eye on the pursuit. \"Run, Artie!

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nItem naming: use display_name for prose; use item_id only in JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nIf mechanics are shown in prose or UI, they must be present in continuity system state or added in continuity system updates in the same STATE_PATCH.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the

never emit bare strings as array entries.\n- character_updates.containers must be an array of objects with at least: container, owner, contents (array).\n- Durable-state mutation blocks are mandatory when applicable:\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects; never an object with an `updates` field.\n- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.\n- If you mutate durable state, do not leave the same mutation only in prose.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n  - Each entry must include character_id, chapter, scene, inventory (full current list), containers (full current list), invariants_add (array), persona_updates (array).\n  - character_updates.inventory MUST be an array of objects, never string item ids.\n  - Inventory object shape: {\"item\": \"ITEM_or_name\", \"container\": \"hand_left|hand_right|<container>\", \"status\": \"held|carried|equipped|stowed\"}.\n  - Container object shape: {\"container\": \"<name>\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_id\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_id\", \"...\"]}.\n  - If you have a single persona update, still wrap it in an array of strings.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger and invariants using standard phrasing, e.g.:\n  - Avoid numeric mechanics in must_stay_true; store them in continuity system updates instead.\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> shard (carried, container=satchel)\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> longsword (carried, container=hand_right)\n  - container: satchel (owner=CHAR_example, contents=[shard, maps])\n  - milestone: shard_bind = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - milestone: maps_acquired = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - injury: right forearm scar / left arm filament\n  - ownership: shard (carried) / shard (bound but physical)\n\nIssues:\n[\n  {\n    \"code\": \"invariant_contradiction\",\n    \"message\": \"The 'must_stay_true' block contains critical internal contradictions: Artie is listed as 'Deceased' and in the 'Character Creation Suite' (Scene 1/2 state) while simultaneously being 'Level 2' with '1 HP' in the 'Whispering Woods' (Scene 5 state).\",\n    \"severity\": \"error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"code\": \"missing_registry_entry\",\n    \"message\": \"ITEM_TROPHY_001 (Participation Trophy) is central to the scene but is missing from the canonical Item Registry.

Artie Penhaligon stood at the center of a twenty-foot cauterized circle, his boots crunching on what used to be a very respectable, very ancient oak tree. Now, it was just carbon and regret. He looked down at his right hand, where his Keyring was still white-knuckled in his grip. The brass teeth of his house keys were slightly bent, humming with a residual heat that suggested they weren't designed for multi-million-damage output.\n\n\"Well,\" Fizz said, her voice cutting through the ringing in his ears. She was hovering three feet to his left, her Standard Guide's Manual open to a page that was vibrating with frantic, golden text. \"That was... statistically improbable.\"\n\n\"Improbable?\" Artie\u2019s voice was a dry rasp. He didn't dare move. He was still Level 2, still possessed of exactly 1 Hit Point, and currently standing in the middle of a literal smoking gun. \"I just vaporized a landmark with a Honda Civic key, Fizz. I think we\u2019ve moved past improbable and into 'the developers are going to ban me' territory.\"\n\n[System Notification]\n[Achievement Unlocked: Overkill is Underrated]\n[Description: Deal 1,000,000% more damage than required to kill a Tutorial Mob.]\n[Reward: 1x Participation Trophy]\n\nA pillar of shimmering, sickly-yellow light descended from the canopy\u2014or where the canopy used to be\u2014and deposited a heavy, gold-plated object directly into Artie\u2019s left hand. \n\nIt was a literal trophy. It featured a small, plastic-looking figure of a man tripping over his own feet while holding a giant '1'. \n\n\"A trophy?\" Artie hoisted the thing. It was surprisingly heavy. \"Is this a joke? I almost died because the physics engine had a stroke, and the System gives me a 'You Tried' award?\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Fizz said, her eyes widening as she scanned the object. \"Artie, don't\u2014\"\n\n[Item Identified: Participation Trophy (Cursed/Unique)]\n[Type: Accessory]\n[Stats: +0 All Attributes]\n[Passive Effect: 'Look At Me!']\n[Description: Increases Aggro Radius by 1,000%. You wanted attention? You got it. Monsters within a 5-mile radius are now legally obligated to find you 'highly punchable.']\n\nArtie\u2019s stomach did a slow, nauseous roll. \"Fizz, what does 'highly punchable' mean in technical terms?\"\n\n\"In technical terms?\" Fizz snapped her manual shut, her expression shifting from amusement to pure, unadulterated panic. \"It means every Level 1 Slime, Level 5 Forest Wolf, and Level 10 Angry Badger in this zone just got a GPS ping on your forehead. And since you have 1 HP, 'punchable' is synonymous with 'dead'.\"\n\nA low, guttural growl echoed from the edge of the crater. Then another. And a third, this one accompanied by the sound of snapping branches and the rhythmic, squelching thud of multiple slimes converging.\n\n[Warning: Aggro Radius Overload]\n[Current Detection Range: 5,000 Meters]\n[Status: Anomaly Detected]\n\n\"I'm dropping it,\" Artie said, trying to open his left hand. The trophy didn't fall. It felt like it was fused to his palm, a cold, metallic weight that refused to obey gravity. \"It\u2019s stuck. Fizz, it\u2019s stuck!\"\n\n\"It\u2019s Soul-Bound, Artie! Cursed items don't just 'drop'!\" Fizz grabbed the back of his shirt with her free hand, her wings fluttering with frantic intensity. \"We need to move. Now! The tutorial gates are three miles North. If we don't reach the Oakhaven Safe Zone, you\u2019re going to be the first player in history to be killed by a swarm of squirrels.\"\n\nArtie didn't wait for a second invitation. He shoved his Keyring into his pocket\u2014nearly stabbing himself in the thigh in his haste\u2014and gripped the Participation Trophy like a football. He scrambled out of the crater, his lungs already burning. \n\nBehind them, the treeline erupted. A dozen Lesser Forest Slimes, normally slow and passive, were moving with terrifying speed, their gelatinous bodies undulating toward the glowing yellow light of the trophy. Above them, a pack of Shadow-Stalking Wolves crested a ridge, their eyes locked onto Artie with a hunger that suggested he was the only steak in a world of salad.\n\n\"Why is it glowing?!\" Artie yelled, leaping over a fallen log. \n\n[System Message: 'Look At Me!' effect is active.]\n[Visual Indicator: Neon Yellow Aura (Visible from Orbit)]\n\n\"Because the System hates you!\" Fizz screamed, flying backward to keep an eye on the pursuit. \"Run, Artie! If anything even grazes your heel, you\u2019re a ghost!\"\n\nArtie sprinted. Every snap of a twig sounded like a death sentence. To his left, a Level 4 Wolf lunged, its teeth snapping inches from his shoulder. He didn't fight; he didn't have the coordination to swing and run at the same time. He just leaned right, the 'Fragile' status flashing in his peripheral vision like a strobe light.\n\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Stamina: 42/100]\n\n\"I hate this game!\" Artie roared, his heart hammering against his ribs. \"I want a refund! I want a manager!\"\n\n\"Win first, complain later!\" Fizz urged, pointing ahead through the dense thicket. \"I see the stone markers! Oakhaven is just past the clearing! Don't stop!\"\n\nArtie didn't stop. He couldn't. Behind him, the sound of the swarm was a physical wall of noise\u2014snarls, barks, and the ominous *thwip-thwip* of slime projectiles. He was a 1 HP glitch in a world that suddenly, desperately, wanted to fix the error.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\":
