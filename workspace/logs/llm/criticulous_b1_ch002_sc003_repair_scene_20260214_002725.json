A hail of glass shards whistled through the air, narrowly missing Artie's head as he lunged toward the pedestal. Outside, the roar of the mob had shifted from a general riot to a focused, predatory chant. They weren't just looting anymore; they were hunting the Anomaly.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 99% (CRITICAL DENSITY)]\n\nArtie didn't look back. The shop was a graveyard of splintered wood and shattered dreams, the air thick with the smell of ozone and old parchment. He reached into the shimmering light of the pedestal and snatched the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion with his right hand. The fabric felt like wet silk and looked like someone had bottled the essence of a thousand high-visibility safety vests. It wasn't just yellow; it was aggressively, offensively neon. It was the kind of yellow that hurt to look at directly, a color that screamed for attention while its very name promised the opposite.\n\n[System Notification: Item Equipped!]\n\n[Cloak of the Cowardly Lion (Unique)]\n[Type: Armor/Back]\n[Stats: +50 Evasion]\n[Passive: Coward\u2019s Sprint - Movement speed increased by 20% when moving away from enemies.]\n[Penalty: -100 Dignity (The world knows what you are.)]\n\n\"Fifty evasion?\" Artie hissed, throwing the garment over his shoulders. The cloak felt surprisingly heavy, as if the weight of his own shame had been woven into the hem. He didn't have time to worry about his dignity; he had exactly one hit point and a shop full of people who suddenly wanted him dead. \"I\u2019ll take it. I\u2019ll take anything that keeps me from being a smear on the floor.\"\n\nThe moment the cloak settled on his frame, a translucent blue box flickered in his peripheral vision, updating his vitals with a crisp, digital chime.\n\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Evasion: 50]\n\nA heavy-set townsperson, eyes glowing with the unnatural red light of the 'Marked for Death' status, vaulted over the shattered counter. He was a butcher by trade, if the blood-stained apron and the massive meat cleaver were any indication. He swung the blade in a wide, desperate arc that should have cleaved Artie in two. \n\nArtie didn't even have time to think about dodging. He didn't move his feet; his body simply blurred. He felt a strange, greasy sensation as the air itself seemed to push him three inches to the left, the cleaver passing through the space where his shoulder had been a millisecond prior. The blade buried itself in the wood of the pedestal with a dull, final *thunk*.\n\n[Evasion Proc! (50% Chance)]\n\n\"Sorry! Just passing through! No refunds!\" Artie shouted, his voice cracking under the strain of pure, unadulterated terror. He pivoted, the neon yellow fabric of the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion snapping behind him like a flare in a dark cave. \n\nThe Participation Trophy remained firmly fused to his left hand, its golden surface pulsing in time with the Aggro Meter. He felt like a walking lighthouse. Every monster, guard, and disgruntled shopper within a mile was currently recalculating their route to intersect with his face. The trophy was a beacon, and the cloak was a neon sign pointing at the beacon. He was the most visible man in Oakhaven, and possibly the most fragile.\n\nThe back wall of the shop groaned as a stray fireball from the street outside clipped the foundation. Dust rained down in thick, choking sheets. Artie scrambled over a pile of ruined crates, his eyes locked on the small, unassuming service door at the rear of the building. \n\nAnother attacker\u2014a low-level thief who had probably just been looking for a quick score\u2014lunged from the shadows of the rafters. The thief\u2019s dagger was aimed straight for Artie\u2019s throat. Again, the gear reacted. Artie did a frantic, uncoordinated stumble-step, his knees buckling in a way that should have sent him face-first into the dirt. Instead, the dagger whistled harmlessly over his head.\n\n[Evasion Proc! (50% Chance)]\n\n\"I hate this game! I hate the math! I hate everything about this!\" Artie yelled, kicking the back door open with a desperate boot.\n\nHe burst out into the narrow, filth-strewn alleyway behind the shop. The 'Coward\u2019s Sprint' kicked in immediately. It wasn't a graceful increase in speed; it felt like his legs had been replaced by high-tension springs. His feet barely touched the cobbles as he bolted away from the collapsing structure. The wind whipped the neon yellow cloak behind him, making him look like a radioactive comet streaking through the gray shadows of Oakhaven\u2019s backstreets.\n\nBehind him, the shop gave one final, agonizing creak before the roof caved in. A cloud of splinters and stone dust billowed out into the alley, momentarily burying the entrance and the mob that had been trying to squeeze through it. \n\nArtie didn't stop to check the loot or catch his breath. He kept running, his heart hammering against his single point of health, the neon yellow streak of his shame the only bright thing in a world that was very quickly trying to delete him.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_ARTIE\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"Oakhaven -

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nUI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says \"always include\".\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it unless explicitly removing a stale fact with REMOVE and restating the current truth.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v2\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\":

        "content": "# REPAIR\n\nFix the scene based on lint issues.\nSummaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\nTimeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: pre-scene invariants and summary facts are binding unless the Scene Card depicts a change. If this scene changes a durable fact, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value and remove the old entry.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n\n- must_stay_true removal (mandatory when a durable fact is superseded):\n  - Add \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" in summary_update.must_stay_true.\n  - Place REMOVE lines before the new final invariant.\n  - REMOVE lines also apply to key_facts_ring (purge stale facts from continuity).\n\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- Inventory posture reconciliation:\n  - If inventory/containers change (held/stowed/container), must_stay_true must be updated to the final posture.\n  - Add REMOVE lines for prior inventory/container invariants before the new final entries.\n  - Use canonical invariant formats:\n    - inventory: CHAR_X -> <item display_name> (status=held|carried|equipped|stowed, container=hand_left|hand_right|<container>)\n    - container: <container> (owner=CHAR_X, contents=[<item display_name>, ...])\nFor held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\nContinuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.\n- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.\n- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.\n- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI gate: only include bracketed UI blocks when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If false, remove or rephrase UI blocks into narrative prose.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or a short parenthetical annotation (e.g., (locked), (Warning: ...)).\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nCanonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\nIf item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for authoritative labels and custody terms.\nUse item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If a durable appearance change occurs in this scene, record it in character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- APPEARANCE_CHECK is required in COMPLIANCE for each cast_present_id (4-8 tokens from atoms/marks).\n\nNaming repairs:\n- If lint flags an item naming issue, fix it with minimal edits.\n- Do not remove humor; simply anchor the item (add display_name near first mention) and ensure custody-change sentences include the display_name.\n- Do not rename item_id or registry fields; only adjust prose wording.\nsummary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\nSTATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\nmust_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\nIf state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\nEnforce scene-card durable constraints: `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\nRespect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`.\n\n- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):\n  - If timeline_scope != \"present\" OR ontological_scope != \"real\", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).\n  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.\n  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category=\"timeline_override\".\n\nReturn corrected prose plus a corrected state_patch JSON block.\n\nOutput format (required, no code fences, no commentary):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n\nAPPEARANCE_CHECK:\n- CHAR_ID: <4-8 tokens from atoms/marks>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}]\n\n- All *_updates arrays must contain objects; never emit bare strings as array entries.\n- JSON shape guardrails (strict, do not deviate):\n  - character_updates MUST be an array of objects.\n    - INVALID: \"character_updates\": {\"character_id\": \"CHAR_X\"}\n    - VALID: \"character_updates\": [{\"character_id\": \"CHAR_X\"}]\n  - character_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects with character_id.\n    - INVALID: \"character_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {...}}\n    - VALID: \"character_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"character_id\": \"CHAR_X\", \"set\": {...}}]\n  - summary_update fields must be arrays of strings.\n    - INVALID: \"summary_update\": {\"last_scene\": \"text\"}\n    - VALID: \"summary_update\": {\"last_scene\": [\"text\"], \"key_events\": [\"...\"], \"must_stay_true\": [\"...\"], \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\"...\"]}\n\n  - appearance_updates MUST be an object under character_updates.\n    - INVALID: \"appearance_updates\": [{\"set\": {...}}] OR \"appearance_updates\": {\"marks_add\": [...]}\n    - VALID: \"appearance_updates\": {\"set\": {\"marks_add\": [{\"name\": \"Singed Hair\", \"location\": \"head\", \"durability\": \"durable\"}]}, \"reason\": \"...\"}\n\n- character_updates.containers must be an array of objects with at least: container, owner, contents (array).\n- Durable-state mutation blocks are mandatory when applicable:\n- Required fields for durable registry entries (when creating NEW ids or filling missing required fields):\n  - item_registry_updates MUST be an array of objects.

Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_device_id, replacement_of.\n  - custodian must be a non-null string id/scope (character id or \"world\"). Never use null.\n    - INVALID: \"custodian\": null\n    - VALID: \"custodian\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\" or \"world\"\n  - owner_scope must be \"character\" or \"world\" and must match the custodian scope.\n  - plot_device_updates: set must include name, custody_scope, custody_ref, activation_state, linked_threads, constraints, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n\n- Transfer vs registry conflict rule (must follow):\n  - If you create a NEW item in item_registry_updates with final custodian already set (e.g., CHAR_ARTIE), DO NOT emit transfer_updates for that item.\n  - If you emit transfer_updates for a NEW item, the registry entry must start with custodian=\"world\" and then transfer to the character.\n  - expected_before must match the registry entry at the moment of transfer (after any registry update that applies before it).  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects; never an object with an `updates` field.\n\n  - inventory_alignment_updates[*].set MUST be an object (not a list).\n    - INVALID: \"set\": []\n    - VALID:   \"set\": {\"inventory\": [...], \"containers\": [...]}\n- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.\n- If you mutate durable state, do not leave the same mutation only in prose.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n- appearance_updates: when a durable appearance change happens, include appearance_updates on the relevant character_updates entry.\n\n  - appearance_updates MUST be an object, not an array.\n    - INVALID: \"appearance_updates\": [{\"set\": {...}, \"reason\": \"...\"}]\n    - VALID: \"appearance_updates\": {\"set\": {\"marks_add\": [{\"name\": \"Singed Hair\", \"location\": \"head\", \"durability\": \"durable\"}]}, \"reason\": \"...\"}\n\n  - appearance_updates.set may include atoms and marks only (canonical truth).\n    - Do NOT put marks_add at the top level; it belongs under set.\n    - Use set.marks_add / set.marks_remove for marks changes.\n    - Use set.atoms for atom changes.\n  - appearance_updates.reason is required (brief, factual).\n  - Do NOT set summary or art text in appearance_updates (derived after acceptance)\n  - Each entry must include character_id, chapter, scene, inventory (full current list), containers (full current list), invariants_add (array), persona_updates (array).\n  - character_updates.inventory MUST be an array of objects, never string item ids.\n  - Inventory object shape: {\"item\":

\"contents\": [\"ITEM_id\", \"...\"]}.\n  - If you have a single persona update, still wrap it in an array of strings.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger and invariants using standard phrasing, e.g.:\n  - Avoid numeric mechanics in must_stay_true; store them in continuity system updates instead.\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> shard (carried, container=satchel)\n  - inventory: CHAR_example -> longsword (carried, container=hand_right)\n  - container: satchel (owner=CHAR_example, contents=[shard, maps])\n  - milestone: shard_bind = DONE/NOT_YET\n  - milestone: maps_acquired =

A hail of glass shards whistled through the air, narrowly missing Artie's head as he lunged toward the pedestal. Outside, the roar of the mob had shifted from a general riot to a focused, predatory chant.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 99% (CRITICAL DENSITY)]\n\nArtie didn't look back. He reached into the shimmering light and snatched the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion. The fabric felt like wet silk and looked like someone had bottled the essence of a thousand high-visibility safety vests. It wasn't just yellow; it was aggressively, offensively neon.\n\n[System Notification: Item Equipped!]\n[Cloak of the Cowardly Lion (Unique)]\n[Type: Armor/Back]\n[Stats: +50 Evasion]\n[Passive: Coward\u2019s Sprint - Movement speed increased by 20% when moving away from enemies.]\n[Penalty: -100 Dignity (The world knows what you are.)]\n\n\"Fifty evasion?\" Artie hissed, throwing the garment over his shoulders. He didn't have time to worry about his dignity; he had exactly one hit point and a shop full of people who suddenly wanted him dead. \"I\u2019ll take it.\"\n\nThe moment the cloak settled on his frame, a translucent blue box flickered in his peripheral vision.\n\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Evasion: 50]\n\nA heavy-set townsperson, eyes glowing with the unnatural red light of the 'Marked for Death' status, vaulted over the shattered counter. He swung a meat cleaver in a wide, desperate arc. Artie didn't even have time to think about dodging. His body simply blurred. He felt a strange, greasy sensation as the air itself seemed to push him three inches to the left. The cleaver buried itself in the wood of the pedestal with a dull *thunk*.\n\n[Evasion Proc! (50% Chance)]\n\n\"Sorry! Just passing through!\" Artie shouted, his voice cracking. He pivoted, the neon yellow fabric of the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion snapping behind him like a flare in a dark cave. \n\nThe Participation Trophy remained firmly fused to his left hand, its golden surface pulsing in time with the Aggro Meter. He felt like a walking lighthouse. Every monster, guard, and disgruntled shopper within a mile was currently recalculating their route to intersect with his face.\n\nThe back wall of the shop groaned as a stray spell from the street outside clipped the foundation. Dust rained down in thick sheets. Artie scrambled over a pile of ruined crates, his eyes locked on the small, unassuming service door at the rear of the building.\n\nAnother attacker\u2014a low-level thief who had probably just been looking for a quick score\u2014lunged from the shadows of the rafters. Artie\u2019s new gear reacted again. He did a frantic, uncoordinated stumble-step that somehow resulted in the thief\u2019s dagger passing through the empty space where Artie\u2019s ribs had been a millisecond prior.\n\n[Evasion Proc! (50% Chance)]\n\n\"I hate this game!\" Artie yelled, kicking the back door open. \n\nHe burst out into the narrow alleyway behind the shop. The 'Coward\u2019s Sprint' kicked in immediately, his legs feeling light and twitchy as he bolted away from the collapsing structure. Behind him, the shop gave one final, agonizing creak before the roof caved in, momentarily burying the entrance and the mob that had been trying to squeeze through it.\n\nArtie didn't stop to check the loot. He kept running, a streak of neon yellow blurring through the gray shadows of Oakhaven\u2019s backstreets, his heart hammering against his single point of health.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"characters\": {\n    \"count\": 5,\n    \"status\": \"READY\",\n    \"updated_at\": \"2026-02-13T07:51:22Z\"\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 2,\n    \"scene\": 3\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"global_continuity_system_state\": {\n    \"active_mechanics\": [\n      \"HP\",\n      \"Crit Rate\",\n      \"Point Buy\",\n      \"System Notification\",\n      \"Damage Number\",\n      \"Level Up\",\n      \"Aggro Meter\"\n    ],\n    \"reality_stability\": 40,\n    \"world_type\": \"settlement_interior\"\n  },\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_002/scene_003.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"DRAFTING\",\n  \"summary\": {\n    \"chapter_so_far\": [\n      \"Artie's attempt to fix his aggro problem backfired, making the Participation Trophy a permanent part of his build.\",\n      \"Artie successfully bypassed a high-level security lock using his crit glitch, revealing the gear he needs to survive.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_facts_ring\": [\n      \"Artie escaped to a residential backstreet, where his Aggro Meter began to decrease from its peak of 96%.\",\n      \"Vane was left behind in the alley, frustrated and intrigued by Artie's survival.\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_VANE -> Obsidian Greatsword (status=held, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"milestone: vane_encounter_survived = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: percussive_maintenance_triggered = DONE\",\n      \"Artie is Level 2 with 1/1 HP and 100% Crit Rate.\",\n      \"Artie entered Barnaby's Bargains & Blunders to offload the Participation Trophy.\",\n      \"The merchant Barnaby identified the trophy as a massive liability and refused the trade.\",\n      \"Artie used a Data Entry critical success to force the trade, but the System blocked it with a soul-bound error.\",\n      \"The Participation Trophy manifested back in Artie's hand with a shockwave that destroyed the shop's interior.\",\n      \"Artie gained the permanent 'The Eternal Participant' status.\",\n      \"The shop was surrounded by aggro-crazed mobs, forcing Artie to look for a back exit.\",\n      \"location: Oakhaven -
