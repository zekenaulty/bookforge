# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Mechanics contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and labels (stats/skills) must be sourced from state or explicitly updated in the state_patch. Do not invent numbers or canonical tokens.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.


USER:

# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.

    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The moss beneath Artie’s boots felt like recycled polyester, a synthetic crunch echoing through the neon-tinged silence of the Whispering Woods. Above, the canopy didn't just rustle; it hissed with the sound of thousands of overlapping voices reciting patch notes in a low, digital monotone. *...fixed a bug where squirrels could phase through reality... increased drop rate for low-quality acorns... optimized shadow rendering for predatory bushes...*

Artie stood frozen, his fingers white-knuckled around the hilt of the Broken Tutorial Sword already gripped in his right hand. The jagged piece of rusted iron felt heavier than it had any right to be, a physical manifestation of his 1 Strength stat. He didn't dare move, not after his last tentative step had triggered a flickering [System Notification: Stealth Check Failed!] that mocked his lack of Agility.

In the upper-left corner of his vision, the translucent red bar was a constant, terrifying reminder of his choices. It was so thin it looked like a stray hair caught on his cornea, a fragile thread of existence that the System deemed sufficient for a 'Statistical Anomaly'.

[HP: 1 / 1]
[MP: 1 / 1]

"One," Artie whispered, his voice barely audible over the mechanical hissing of the leaves. "It’s really just one."

"It’s a very sturdy one," Fizz said, hovering a few feet away. She was tapping away at her Data Slate, the blue light of the screen reflecting off her wings in sharp, jagged patterns. "Technically, it's a whole number. It’s significantly better than zero. Although, in this zone, the difference between one and zero is usually about three kilograms of force or a particularly aggressive sneeze."

She looked up from her slate, her eyes tracking the Level 1 Slime that was currently vibrating in the center of the clearing. The creature was a translucent, lime-green mass of semi-solid sludge, about the size of a beach ball. Inside its gelatinous body, Artie could see the half-dissolved remains of a tutorial handbook and what looked like a very surprised-looking crow. Two black, bead-like eyes drifted lazily within the goo, eventually settling on Artie with a mindless, predatory focus.

[Tutorial Slime - Lvl 1]
[HP: 10/10]
[Status: Aggressive]

"Right," Artie said, trying to find a center he wasn't sure he possessed. "One hundred percent crit rate. That’s the plan. I just need to hit it before it hits me."

"A bold strategy, Cotton," Fizz muttered, her wings buzzing with a sound like a cooling fan. "Just a friendly reminder: that slime’s 'Passive Ooze' aura deals 0.1 damage per second to anything within a one-meter radius. Since the System rounds up for damage calculations..."

Artie’s eyes widened, his gaze darting from the slime to the invisible boundary Fizz was describing. "Wait, what? Rounds up? You mean 0.1 becomes...?"

"One," Fizz confirmed with a grin that was entirely too cheerful for the situation. "Math is a cruel mistress, Artie. If it touches you, you’re dead. If you stand too close for too long, you’re dead. If it spits on you, you’re dead. Honestly, if it just looks at you with enough intensity, I might have to start looking for a new assignment. I hear the 'Infinite Mana' builds are much more relaxing to guide."

The slime lunged. 

It wasn't a fast movement, but it was relentless. It gathered its mass, the green sludge rippling with a sound like a giant heart beating inside a bucket of mayonnaise, and threw itself forward in a wet, heavy flop. Artie scrambled backward, his heel catching on a gnarled root that looked like a charred circuit board. He flailed, his arms windmilling as he barely kept his balance, the rusted sword nearly slipping from his sweat-slicked palm.

The slime landed exactly where he had been standing a second ago, the ground sizzling slightly where the ooze touched the moss. A small cloud of digital ozone rose from the impact site.

"Missed!" Artie shouted, his voice an octave higher than usual.

"By about three inches," Fizz noted, checking her slate again. "Your heart rate is currently 140 BPM. If it hits 160, I think your 1 HP might just give up out of sheer stress. The System has a very low tolerance for 'Emotional Damage' when your Vitality is this low."

Artie didn't respond. He was too busy watching the slime re-orient itself. The creature didn't have a front or a back, just a shifting mass of hunger that was already turning toward him again. The Whispering Woods seemed to lean in, the shadows of the trees jittering a fraction of a second after the branches did, as if the world’s rendering engine was struggling to keep up with his precarious existence.

To his left, a thicket of thorns hummed with static electricity, the needles glowing with a faint, dangerous purple light. To his right, the ground fell away into a steep ravine filled with a thick, lavender fog that smelled of burnt copper. He was being hemmed in, the gnarled roots of a 'Patch-Note Oak' rising up behind him like a wall of jagged iron.

The slime wobbled again, its entire body pulsing with a sickly light. It was faster this time. It didn't just flop; it launched itself, a glob of green slime detaching from its main body like a projectile. 

Artie ducked, the glob whistling over his head with a sound like a wet whip. It slammed into the Patch-Note Oak behind him, the bark hissing and beginning to melt. The 'Whispering' of the tree turned into a distorted, high-pitched scream of ERROR: CORRUPT TEXTURE DATA before the sound cut out into static.

"It has a ranged attack?" Artie yelled, scrambling to his feet and nearly tripping over his own Linen Tunic, which felt as thin and useless as a hospital gown.

"It’s a slime, Artie. They’re 90% projectile," Fizz said. She was now hovering upside down, looking bored. "Honestly, the fact that you’re still alive is a statistical anomaly in itself. The System is probably already trying to figure out which sub-routine it needs to run to fix you. You’re like a divide-by-zero error in a pair of boots."

Artie backed away, his shoulders hitting the cold, metallic bark of the tree. The slime was moving with a strange, predatory intelligence now, its gelatinous body stretching out to cover more ground, cutting off his only clear path back toward the center of the clearing. 

[Warning: Enemy is charging a Heavy Attack!]
[Probability of Survival: 0.0001%]

The notification flashed in bright, neon yellow, obscuring his vision for a split second. 

"Shut up," Artie hissed at the air. 

The slime distended, its green body growing thin and taut like a rubber band being pulled to its breaking point. The two black eyes stared at Artie, reflecting his own terrified face. The air in the woods felt heavy, the whispers of the trees reaching a fever pitch as they anticipated the 'Deletion' event. 

Artie gripped the Broken Tutorial Sword with both hands now, though the System still registered it as being in his right. He needed to time this. One hit. That was all it would take. With his 100% Crit Rate, even a 1 Strength swing should be enough to vaporize a Level 1 mob, provided the math held up.

"Come on," Artie breathed, the world slowing down as the slime launched itself. 

It was a wall of green death, a solid mass of corrosive sludge flying through the air with the weight of a bowling ball. Artie had nowhere to go. He was cornered, the jagged roots pinning him in place, the smell of rot and acid filling his nostrils. The heat of the creature’s 'Passive Ooze' began to prickle against his skin, a warning that the 0.1 damage was only milliseconds away.

Artie swung. He didn't swing with strength—he didn't have any. He swung with the desperation of a man who had already died once and really didn't want to make a habit of it.

The broken blade cut through the air, trailing a faint, golden light—the signature of a guaranteed Critical Hit.

But the slime was already mid-air, its mass shifting, its trajectory aimed directly at Artie’s chest. The collision was inevitable, a mathematical certainty that Artie’s 1 HP was about to be tested against the full weight of a Level 1 tutorial boss.

"Artie!" Fizz shouted, her snark finally replaced by genuine alarm as the green mass obscured her view of her charge.

The sword connected with the outer membrane of the slime, the golden light flaring bright enough to drown out the neon green of the woods. But the momentum of the creature didn't stop, and Artie felt the first touch of the cold, acidic sludge against his Linen Tunic.
