The Participation Trophy was glowing with a sickly, neon-orange light that seemed to pulse in time with his own frantic heartbeat. It wasn't just an item; it was a homing beacon for every bad decision in a fifty-mile radius.\n\nArtie stepped onto the cobblestones of Oakhaven\u2019s Town Square, and the atmosphere shifted instantly. The bustling market, filled with NPCs hawking \"Crit-Chance Potions\" and players comparing the glow of their enchanted codpieces, went silent. A literal path cleared in front of him. It wasn't out of respect; it was the biological imperative of every living thing to move away from a ticking time bomb.\n\n[Aggro Meter: 95% (Critical Warning: Monster Beacon Active)]\n\n\"Great,\" Artie muttered, his fingers tightening around the cold, gold-plated base of the Participation Trophy. \"I\u2019m not a hero; I\u2019m a localized natural disaster.\"\n\nHe tried to keep his head down, mousy brown hair falling over his hazel eyes, but it was hard to be inconspicuous when you were a walking rave. He adjusted the Corporate ID Badge hanging from his neck\u2014a useless piece of plastic from a world where the biggest threat was a passive-aggressive CC\u2019d email\u2014and started toward the western gate.\n\nHe didn't make it ten paces.\n\nA shadow fell across the stones, long and jagged like a serrated blade. The air temperature seemed to drop ten degrees, smelling suddenly of ozone and expensive leather. Artie stopped. His 1 HP pulsed in his vision, a tiny, fragile red sliver that felt like it was made of spun glass.\n\n\"So,\" a voice drawled, dripping with the kind of confidence only attainable by someone who has never been told 'no' by a vending machine. \"You\u2019re the Anomaly.\"\n\nArtie looked up. Standing in the center of the square was a man who looked like he had been designed by a committee of people who thought 'subtlety' was a type of sandwich. He was tall, athletic, and clad in obsidian plate armor so polished Artie could see his own terrified reflection in the breastplate.\n\n[Vane - Lvl 45]\n[Title: Top 100 Slayer]\n[HP: 500/500]\n\nThe man shifted, and the massive weapon held in his right hand caught the sunlight. The Obsidian Greatsword was a monstrosity of volcanic glass and cruel geometry, the edge so sharp it looked like it was cutting the air itself just by existing.\n\n\"I prefer 'Arthur,' or 'Artie' if we\u2019re being casual,\" Artie said, his voice cracking only slightly. \"And you are... wearing a lot of black for a sunny day. Isn't that hot?\"\n\nVane didn't laugh. He didn't even blink. His steely grey eyes scanned Artie with the clinical detachment of a butcher looking at a side of beef. \n\n\"I watched the gate logs,\" Vane said, stepping forward. The crowd retreated further, forming a wide circle of spectators. \"One health point. A statistical impossibility. And yet, the scanners say you hit like a god. Or a glitch.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s a very specialized build,\" Artie lied, his mind racing. \"High risk, high reward. Mostly risk. Actually, it\u2019s about 99% risk. Can I go now? I have a... thing. A meeting about a cloak.\"\n\nVane raised the Obsidian Greatsword, the tip hovering inches from Artie\u2019s chest. The sheer presence of the weapon caused a [Danger] notification to flicker at the edge of Artie\u2019s UI.\n\n\"I don't like glitches,\" Vane said softly. \"They mess with the rankings. They make the hard work of players like me look... inefficient. I think I\u2019ll see what happens when that one point of health meets a Level 45 Execute.\"\n\n[Aggro Meter: 96% (Warning: Target Locked)]\n\n\"Whoa, hey!\" Artie held up his right hand, while his left continued to clutch the Participation Trophy like a shield. \"Let's talk about this. I\u2019m a Junior Analyst. I do spreadsheets. I don't even know how to hold a sword properly. You\u2019d be killing a man who once spent forty minutes trying to find the 'any' key.\"\n\n\"Then you won't mind a test,\" Vane said. \n\nHe moved. To Artie\u2019s eyes, it wasn't a movement so much as a teleportation. The Obsidian Greatsword swung in a horizontal arc, a black blur aimed directly at Artie\u2019s neck. \n\nArtie didn't think. He didn't have time to think. His body, fueled by the pure, unadulterated cowardice that had kept him alive through three corporate restructures, simply gave out. His knees buckled, and he tripped over a loose cobblestone.\n\nThe black blade whistled through the space where his head had been a microsecond before. The force of the swing was so great it sent a shockwave of air that ruffled Artie\u2019s hair and nearly tore the Corporate ID Badge from his neck.\n\n[Dodge! (Luck: 100%)]\n[System Note: That was pathetic, but effective.]\n\nArtie scrambled backward on his backside, the Participation Trophy clunking against the ground. \"See? Terrible fighter! I\u2019m basically a toddler in a dress shirt!\"\n\nVane frowned, his jet black hair perfectly in place despite the exertion. He looked at his sword, then back at Artie. \"You didn't parry. You didn't even try to block. You just... fell.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s my signature move,\" Artie gasped, his heart hammering against his ribs. \"I call it 'The Sudden Lack of Skeleton.' It\u2019s very advanced.\"\n\nVane\u2019s eyes narrowed. The curiosity in them was being replaced by a cold, sharp irritation. He gripped the hilt of the Obsidian Greatsword with both hands now. \"No one dodges me by accident. Not with my Agility stat.\"\n\n\"Maybe your math is off?\" Artie suggested, slowly finding his feet while keeping the trophy between them. \"Have you tried carrying the one? I find that\u2019s where most people stumble.\"\n\nThe crowd was whispering now. A Level 2 had just 'dodged' a Top 100 Slayer. The logic of the world was straining, and Artie could almost feel the reality stability dipping. He needed to leave. Now.\n\n\"I\u2019m going to hit you again,\" Vane said, his voice flat. \"And this time, I\u2019m using a Skill.\"\n\n[Vane is casting: Whirlwind of the Void]\n\n\"Oh, look! Is that a Legendary Loot Drop behind you?\" Artie yelled, pointing frantically toward the fountain.\n\nVane didn't even turn. \"Cheap. Predictable.\"\n\n\"No, seriously, it\u2019s glowing!\" \n\nArtie didn't wait to see if Vane believed him. He turned and bolted. He didn't run like a hero; he ran like a man who had seen a spider in his shower. He ducked under the arm of a startled merchant, dived through a display of 'Authentic Dragon Scales' (which were clearly painted plywood), and sprinted toward a narrow alleyway between the alchemist\u2019s shop and a tavern.\n\n\"Get back here!\" Vane\u2019s roar echoed through the square.\n\nArtie didn't look back. He squeezed into the alley, the Participation Trophy humming a frantic, high-pitched note that set his teeth on edge. He could hear the heavy clank of obsidian armor behind him, the sound of a predator who wasn't used to his prey having a head start.\n\nHe saw a stack of empty crates and, without slowing down, delivered a sharp kick to the base of the pile.\n\n[Skill Triggered: Percussive Maintenance (Rank F)]\n[Critical Hit!]\n\nThe crates didn't just fall; they exploded into a chaotic mess of splinters and heavy wood, perfectly blocking the narrow passage behind him. \n\n\"I\u2019m sorry!\" Artie screamed over his shoulder. \"I\u2019ll pay for those! Send the invoice to the Mayor!\"\n\nHe burst out the other side of the alley, found himself in a residential backstreet, and didn't stop running until the Aggro Meter in his vision finally started to tick downward. He was alive. He was at 1 HP. And he had just made an enemy of the most dangerous man in the city.\n\n\"Welcome to Oakhaven,\" Artie wheezed, leaning against a stone wall and clutching the glowing trophy to his chest. \"Where the air is fresh and everyone wants to murder me for my math.\"\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"CHAR_VANE\"],\n    \"location\": \"Oakhaven -

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nUI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says \"always include\".\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it unless explicitly removing a stale fact with REMOVE and restating the current truth.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v2\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\n\ufeffOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\":

        "content": "# WRITE\nWrite the scene described by the scene card.\n- YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN PROSE AND THE STATE_PATCH.\n- Start in motion. No recap.\n- Summaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\n- Use the continuity pack and state for continuity.\n- Use character_registry to keep names consistent in prose.\n- Timeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\n- State primacy: pre-scene invariants and summary facts are binding unless the Scene Card depicts a change. If this scene changes a durable fact, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value and remove the old entry.\n- Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n- must_stay_true is end-of-scene truth only (last occurrence wins); do not keep earlier values that are superseded by the scene.\n- must_stay_true removal (mandatory when a durable fact is superseded):\n  - Add \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" in summary_update.must_stay_true.\n  - Place REMOVE lines before the new final invariant.\n  - REMOVE lines also apply to key_facts_ring (purge stale facts from continuity).\n- Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\n- Inventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- Inventory posture reconciliation:\n  - If inventory/containers change (held/stowed/container), must_stay_true must be updated to the final posture.\n  - Add REMOVE lines for prior inventory/container invariants before the new final entries.\n  - Use canonical invariant formats:\n    - inventory: CHAR_X -> <item display_name> (status=held|carried|equipped|stowed, container=hand_left|hand_right|<container>)\n    - container: <container> (owner=CHAR_X, contents=[<item display_name>, ...])\n- must_stay_true is end-of-scene truth only (last occurrence wins); do not keep earlier values that are superseded by the scene.\n\n- For held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\n- Continuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.\n- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.\n- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.\n- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI gate: only include bracketed UI blocks when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If false, do not include UI blocks; rephrase into narrative prose.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or a short parenthetical annotation (e.g., (locked), (Warning: ...)).\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\n- titles are arrays of objects with stable name fields; do not emit titles as plain strings.\n- If item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for ownership/custody labels in authoritative outputs.\n- Use item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If a durable appearance change occurs in this scene, record it in character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- APPEARANCE_CHECK is required in COMPLIANCE for each cast_present_id (4-8 tokens from atoms/marks).\n\nDurable item naming discipline:\n- When you first describe a durable item, anchor it by using the canonical display_name within the same paragraph (or within the next 2 sentences).\n- After anchoring, you may use brief descriptors for style if unambiguous.\n- During any custody/handling change, include the canonical display_name in that sentence.\n- If a required event is not in the Scene Card, do not perform it.\n- Enforce scene-card durable constraints: honor `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, and `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\n- Respect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope` when proposing durable mutations; do not mutate physical custody in non-present/non-real scope unless explicitly marked override.\n- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):\n  - If timeline_scope != \"present\" OR ontological_scope != \"real\", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).\n  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.\n  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category=\"timeline_override\".\n- summary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\n- STATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\n- must_stay_true is end-of-scene truth only (last occurrence wins); do not keep earlier values that are superseded by the scene.\n\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\n- must_stay_true is end-of-scene truth only (last occurrence wins); do not keep earlier values that are superseded by the scene.\n\n- If state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\n- must_stay_true is end-of-scene truth only (last occurrence wins); do not keep earlier values that are superseded by the scene.\n\n- Return prose plus a state_patch JSON block.\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- must_stay_true is end-of-scene truth only (last occurrence wins); do not keep earlier values that are superseded by the scene.\n\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects.

Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n- Transfer vs registry conflict rule (must follow):\n  - If you create a NEW item in item_registry_updates with final custodian already set (e.g., CHAR_ARTIE), DO NOT emit transfer_updates for that item.\n  - If you emit transfer_updates for a NEW item, the registry entry must start with custodian=\"world\" and then transfer to the character.\n  - expected_before must match the registry entry at the moment of transfer (after any registry update that applies before it).  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects; never an object with an `updates` field.\n- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.\n- If you mutate durable state, do not leave the same mutation only in prose.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n- appearance_updates: when a durable appearance change happens, include appearance_updates on the relevant character_updates entry.\n  - appearance_updates MUST be an object, not an array.\n    - INVALID: \"appearance_updates\": [{\"set\": {...}, \"reason\": \"...\"}]\n    - VALID: \"appearance_updates\": {\"set\": {\"marks_add\": [{\"name\": \"Singed Hair\", \"location\": \"head\", \"durability\": \"durable\"}]}, \"reason\": \"...\"}\n  - appearance_updates.set may include atoms and marks only (canonical truth).\n    - Do NOT put marks_add at the top level;

rhythmic intensity of a subwoofer in a teenager\u2019s trunk. I checked the floating red bar hovering above its translucent, jiggly head. \n\n[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 3] [HP: 45/45]\n\nForty-five health. At my current Strength of 12, with a base weapon damage of 4-6, I was looking at a nine-hit kill minimum, assuming the RNG gods didn't decide to spit on my shoes today. \n\n\"You know,\" I said, adjusting my grip on the rusted shortsword. \"In most worlds, puddles are for stepping in, not for getting dissolved by.\"\n\nThe slime responded by launching a glob of corrosive mucus. I rolled left, the grass staining my knees.\n\n[Stamina: 88/100]\n\n\"Missed me. Barely. That\u2019s a three-second cooldown on your spit, isn't it?\"\n\nI didn't wait for the confirmation. I lunged. The blade sank into the gelatinous mass with a sound like a heavy boot pulling out of thick mud.\n\n[Critical Hit! -14 HP]\n\n\"There we go. Who needs luck when you have math?\"\n\nThe slime shuddered, its HP bar dipping into the yellow. \n\n[HP: 31/45]\n\n\"One more of those and we can talk about your retirement plan,\" I muttered. My lungs burned slightly, a reminder that my Agility was still garbage. \n\n[Passive Skill Gained: Basic Analysis (Rank F)]\n[Description: You can see basic stats and cooldowns of enemies within 5 meters. You\u2019ve stopped guessing and started counting. Good for you.]\n\n\"Finally,\" I breathed, dodging another glob. \"The ding is coming. I can practically taste the experience points. They taste like copper and bad decisions.\" \n\nI swung again, the numbers popping in the air like neon confetti. This wasn't just a fight; it was a grind.
