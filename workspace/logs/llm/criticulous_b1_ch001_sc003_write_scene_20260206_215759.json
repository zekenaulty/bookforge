It felt like being shoved through a keyhole by a very large, very impatient foot. Artie hit the ground with a thud that vibrated through his teeth, the smell of damp pine and digitized ozone filling his lungs.\n\nHe didn't move for a second. He just lay there, face-down in moss that felt suspiciously like recycled polyester.\n\n\"Welcome to the world of *Crit-iculous*,\" Fizz\u2019s voice drifted down, dripping with a level of sarcasm that could probably erode granite. \"Try not to die in the first thirty seconds. It makes the paperwork a nightmare, and I\u2019ve already reached my quota for 'idiots who fell off the spawn platform' this fiscal quarter.\"\n\nArtie groaned, pushing himself up. As he did, a translucent red bar flickered into existence in the upper-left corner of his vision. It was so thin it looked like a stray hair caught on his cornea. \n\n[HP: 1 / 1]\n[MP: 1 / 1]\n\n\"One,\" Artie whispered, his voice cracking. \"It\u2019s really just one.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s a very sturdy one,\" Fizz said, hovering a few feet away. She was tapping away at her Data Slate, the blue light of the screen reflecting off her wings. \"Technically, it's a whole number. It\u2019s significantly better than zero. Although, in this zone, the difference between one and zero is usually about three kilograms of force or a particularly aggressive sneeze.\"\n\nArtie stood up, dusting off his Linen Tunic. He felt light. Too light. His Strength was at the absolute minimum the System allowed without him collapsing into a puddle of sentient meat. He reached down and gripped the hilt of the Broken Tutorial Sword strapped to his hip, drawing it with a metallic *shink* that sounded far more heroic than the weapon looked. It was a jagged piece of rusted iron that looked like it had been used to pry open crates for a decade before being handed to him.\n\n\"Right,\" Artie said, trying to find his center. \"One hundred percent crit rate. That\u2019s the plan. I just need to hit them before they hit me.\"\n\n\"A bold strategy, Cotton,\" Fizz muttered, not looking up from her slate. \"Let\u2019s see how it plays out against the local wildlife.\"\n\nThe Whispering Woods lived up to its name, but not in the way the travel brochures probably described. The wind didn't rustle the leaves; it hissed through them in a way that sounded like thousands of overlapping voices reciting patch notes. *...fixed a bug where squirrels could phase through reality... increased drop rate for low-quality acorns... optimized shadow rendering for predatory bushes...*\n\nThe trees themselves were massive, gnarled things with bark that looked like charred circuit boards. The light filtering through the canopy was a sickly, neon-tinged green, casting long, jittery shadows that seemed to move a fraction of a second after the branches did. It was a beautiful place, if you liked your nature with a side of existential dread and a high probability of mechanical failure.\n\nArtie took a step forward, his boots crunching on a fallen branch.\n\n[System Notification: Stealth Check Failed!]\n[Reason: You have the grace of a caffeinated toddler in a room full of bubble wrap.]\n\n\"Oh, that\u2019s helpful,\" Artie snapped. \"Thanks, System.\"\n\n\"Don't blame the System for your lack of Agility,\" Fizz said, floating alongside him. \"You\u2019re the one who decided that 'moving quietly' was a luxury you couldn't afford. You\u2019re basically a walking dinner bell for anything with ears. Or vibrations. Or a general sense of hunger.\"\n\nA low, wet sound echoed from behind a cluster of glowing ferns. It was a rhythmic, pulsing noise, like a giant heart beating inside a bucket of mayonnaise. Artie froze, his hand tightening on the hilt of his broken sword.\n\n\"Is that...?\"\n\n\"That,\" Fizz said, finally stowing her Data Slate and crossing her arms, \"is your first lesson in humility. Or your last lesson in existence. It\u2019s a toss-up, really.\"\n\nThe ferns parted, and a Level 1 Slime wobbled into the clearing. \n\nIt wasn't the cute, bouncy mascot from a classic JRPG. It was a translucent, lime-green mass of semi-solid sludge, about the size of a beach ball and twice as heavy. Inside its gelatinous body, Artie could see the half-dissolved remains of a tutorial handbook and what looked like a very surprised-looking crow. Two black, bead-like eyes drifted lazily within the goo, eventually settling on Artie.\n\n[Tutorial Slime - Lvl 1]\n[HP: 10/10]\n[Status: Aggressive]\n\nThe slime didn't roar. It just... vibrated. The sound was a low-frequency hum that made Artie\u2019s 1 HP feel even more precarious. \n\n\"Okay,\" Artie said, his heart hammering against his ribs. \"It\u2019s Level 1. I can do this. I have a sword. I have the crits.\"\n\n\"You also have the durability of a wet paper towel in a hurricane,\" Fizz reminded him. \"Just a friendly reminder: that slime\u2019s 'Passive Ooze' aura deals 0.1 damage per second to anything within a one-meter radius. Since the System rounds up for damage calculations...\"\n\nArtie\u2019s eyes widened. \"Wait, what?\"\n\n\"Math is a cruel mistress, Artie,\" Fizz said with a grin. \"If it touches you, you\u2019re dead. If you stand too close for too long, you\u2019re dead. If it spits on you, you\u2019re dead. Honestly, if it just looks at you with enough intensity, I might have to start looking for a new assignment.\"\n\nThe slime lunged. \n\nIt wasn't a fast movement, but it was relentless. It gathered its mass and threw itself forward in a wet, heavy flop. Artie scrambled backward, his heel catching on a root. He flailed, his arms windmilling as he barely kept his balance. The slime landed exactly where he had been standing a second ago, the ground sizzling slightly where the ooze touched the moss.\n\n\"Missed!\" Artie shouted, his voice an octave higher than usual.\n\n\"By about three inches,\" Fizz noted. \"Your heart rate is currently 140 BPM. If it hits 160, I think your 1 HP might just give up out of sheer stress.\"\n\nArtie didn't respond. He was too busy watching the slime. It was already re-orienting itself, the green sludge rippling as it prepared for another lunge. Artie held the broken sword out in front of him, his hands shaking. He needed to time this. One hit. That was all it would take. With his 100% Crit Rate, even a 1 Strength punch with a broken sword should be enough to vaporize a Level 1 mob.\n\nBut he had to get close.\n\nAnd getting close meant entering the 'Passive Ooze' zone.\n\n\"Fizz, how far is a meter?\" Artie asked, his eyes locked on the slime\u2019s bead-like eyes.\n\n\"About three of your very shaky steps,\" she replied. \"Or one very confident lunge. Which, given your current state, I wouldn't recommend.\"\n\nThe slime wobbled again, its entire body pulsing with a sickly light. It was faster this time. It didn't just flop; it launched itself, a glob of green slime detaching from its main body like a projectile. \n\nArtie ducked, the glob whistling over his head and slamming into a tree behind him. The bark hissed and began to melt, the 'Whispering' of the tree turning into a distorted, high-pitched scream of *ERROR: CORRUPT TEXTURE DATA*.\n\n\"It has a ranged attack?\" Artie yelled, scrambling to his feet.\n\n\"It\u2019s a slime, Artie. They\u2019re 90% projectile,\" Fizz said. She was now hovering upside down, looking bored. \"Honestly, the fact that you\u2019re still alive is a statistical anomaly in itself. The System is probably already trying to figure out which sub-routine it needs to run to fix you.\"\n\nArtie backed away, but he was running out of clearing. Behind him, the gnarled roots of a 'Patch-Note Oak' rose up like a wall, their jagged edges looking just as lethal as the slime. He was being hemmed in. To his left, a thicket of thorns that hummed with static electricity; to his right, a steep drop into a ravine filled with purple fog.\n\nThe slime moved again, cutting off his only clear path back toward the spawn point. It was moving with a strange, predatory intelligence, its gelatinous body stretching out to cover more ground.\n\nArtie looked at his peripheral vision again. \n\n[HP: 1 / 1]\n\nThe red bar seemed to be mocking him. It was a reminder that he was a glitch in the matrix, a mistake that the world was currently trying to erase. One point of damage. That was all it would take. A single drop of acid, a stray thorn, a fall of more than two feet.\n\n\"I can't dodge forever,\" Artie muttered, his back hitting the cold, metallic bark of the tree. \n\n\"Correct,\" Fizz said, floating closer. Her snarky expression softened just a fraction, though her voice remained sharp. \"You\u2019re a glass cannon, Artie. But right now, you\u2019re just the glass. If you want to be the cannon, you have to actually fire.\"\n\nThe slime gathered itself for a final lunge. It distended, its green body growing thin and taut like a rubber band being pulled to its breaking point. The two black eyes stared at Artie, reflecting his own terrified face.\n\nArtie gripped the Broken Tutorial Sword. His knuckles were white. The air in the Whispering Woods felt heavy, the whispers of the trees reaching a fever pitch as they anticipated the 'Deletion' event. \n\n[Warning: Enemy is charging a Heavy Attack!]\n[Probability of Survival: 0.0001%]\n\n\"Shut up,\" Artie hissed at the notification. \n\nThe slime launched. It was a wall of green death, a solid mass of corrosive sludge flying through the air with the weight of a bowling ball. Artie had nowhere to go. He was cornered, his back against the tree, the jagged roots pinning him in place. \n\nHe raised the sword, but his arms felt like lead. The 1 Strength stat was a heavy burden to carry when your life depended on a single, perfect swing. \n\n\"Come on,\" Artie breathed, the world slowing down as the slime closed the distance. \"Just one hit. Just one damn hit.\"\n\nThe slime was inches away, the smell of its rot filling his nostrils, the heat of its acid beginning to prickle against his skin. Artie swung, not with strength, but with the desperation of a man who had already died once and really didn't want to make a habit of it.\n\nThe broken blade cut through the air, trailing a faint, golden light\u2014the signature of a guaranteed Critical Hit.\n\nBut the slime was already mid-air, its mass shifting, its trajectory aimed directly at Artie\u2019s chest.\n\n\"Artie!\" Fizz shouted, her snark finally replaced by genuine alarm.\n\nThe sword connected with the outer membrane of the slime, but the momentum of the creature didn't stop. It was a collision course, and Artie was the only one with everything to lose.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"CHAR_FIZZ\"],\n    \"location\": \"The Whispering Woods\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie spawned in the Whispering Woods and immediately noticed his 1/1 HP bar.\",\n      \"The Whispering Woods are mechanically hostile, with trees whispering patch notes and error logs.\",\n      \"Artie encountered a Level 1 Tutorial Slime that is aggressive and has corrosive properties.\",\n      \"Fizz provided snarky commentary on Artie's extreme fragility.\",\n      \"Artie is cornered by the slime against a Patch-Note Oak and is attempting a desperate counter-attack.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"]\n  },\n  \"character_stat_updates\": {\n    \"CHAR_ARTIE\": {\n      \"hp\": { \"set\": 1 },\n      \"mp\": { \"set\": 1 },\n      \"luck\": { \"set\": 99 },\n      \"strength\": { \"set\": 1 },\n      \"agility\": { \"set\": 1 },\n      \"intelligence\": { \"set\": 1 },\n      \"vitality\": { \"set\": 1 }\n    }\n  },\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 3,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        { \"item\": \"Broken Tutorial Sword\", \"container\": \"hand_right\", \"status\": \"carried\" },\n        { \"item\": \"Linen Tunic\", \"container\": \"body\", \"status\": \"equipped\" },\n        { \"item\": \"Single Copper Coin\", \"container\": \"pockets\", \"status\": \"stowed\" }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        { \"container\": \"hand_right\", \"location\": \"arm_right\", \"contents\": [\"Broken Tutorial Sword\"], \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\" },\n        { \"container\": \"pockets\", \"location\": \"legs\", \"contents\": [\"Single Copper Coin\"], \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\" },\n        { \"container\": \"body\", \"location\": \"torso\", \"contents\": [\"Linen Tunic\"], \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\" }\n      ],\n      \"invariants_add\": [\n        \"milestone: first_spawn = DONE\",\n        \"milestone: slime_encounter_start = DONE\",\n        \"milestone: hp_check_1_1 = DONE\"\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie is experiencing the visceral terror of his 1 HP build in a hostile environment.\",\n        \"Artie is beginning to realize that 'mechanical hostility' in this world is literal.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_FIZZ\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 3,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        { \"item\": \"Data Slate\", \"container\": \"hand_left\", \"status\": \"carried\" }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        { \"container\": \"hand_left\", \"location\": \"arm_left\", \"contents\": [\"Data Slate\"], \"owner\": \"CHAR_FIZZ\" }\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Fizz's professional detachment is occasionally broken by the sheer absurdity/danger of Artie's situation.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie spawned into the Whispering Woods, a tutorial zone where the trees whisper system patch notes and the environment is mechanically hostile.\",\n      \"He was immediately confronted by a Level 1 Tutorial Slime, realizing that its passive acid damage and ranged attacks make his 1 HP build nearly impossible to manage.\",\n      \"The scene ended with Artie cornered against a tree, swinging his broken sword at the slime in a desperate attempt to survive its heavy attack.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Artie confirmed his 1/1 HP status via the in-game UI.\",\n      \"The Whispering Woods was established as a deceptive and glitched environment.\",\n      \"Artie engaged in his first combat encounter with a Level 1 Tutorial Slime.\",\n      \"Fizz highlighted the 'Passive Ooze' aura as a lethal threat to a 1 HP character.\",\n      \"Artie was cornered by the slime, highlighting his lack of mobility and defensive options.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"milestone: build_confirmed = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: first_spawn = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: slime_encounter_start = DONE\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Broken Tutorial Sword (carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Linen Tunic (equipped, container=body)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_FIZZ -> Data Slate (carried, container=hand_left)\",\n      \"stat: CHAR_ARTIE -> HP = 1\",\n      \"location: The Whispering Woods\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Artie entered the tutorial zone, The Whispering Woods, and faced his first enemy: a Level 1 Slime.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nMechanics contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and labels (stats/skills) must be sourced from state or explicitly updated in the state_patch. Do not invent numbers or canonical tokens.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the RNG-Hellscape\",\"goal\":\"Introduce Artie and his

If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n- Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\n- Inventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- Numbers must be owned: any UI/prose number shown must exist in state or be added in the patch.\n- Skills must be owned: any skill names, ranks, cooldowns, or charges shown must exist in state or be added in the patch.\n- Canonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\n- For held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\n- If a required event is not in the Scene Card, do not perform it.\n- summary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\n- STATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose;

I checked the floating red bar hovering above its translucent, jiggly head. \n\n[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 3] [HP: 45/45]\n\nForty-five health. At my current Strength of 12, with a base weapon damage of 4-6, I was looking at a nine-hit kill minimum, assuming the RNG gods didn't decide to spit on my shoes today. \n\n\"You know,\" I said, adjusting my grip on the rusted shortsword. \"In most worlds, puddles are for stepping in, not for getting dissolved by.\"\n\nThe slime responded by launching a glob of corrosive mucus. I rolled left, the grass staining my knees.\n\n[Stamina: 88/100]\n\n\"Missed me. Barely. That\u2019s a three-second cooldown on your spit, isn't it?\"\n\nI didn't wait for the confirmation. I lunged. The blade sank into the gelatinous mass with a sound like a heavy boot pulling out of thick mud.\n\n[Critical Hit! -14 HP]\n\n\"There we go. Who needs luck when you have math?\"\n\nThe slime shuddered, its HP bar dipping into the yellow. \n\n[HP: 31/45]\n\n\"One more of those and we can talk about your retirement plan,\" I muttered. My lungs burned slightly, a reminder that my Agility was still garbage. \n\n[Passive Skill Gained: Basic Analysis (Rank F)]\n[Description: You can see basic stats and cooldowns of enemies within 5 meters. You\u2019ve stopped guessing and started counting. Good for you.]\n\n\"Finally,\" I breathed, dodging another glob. \"The ding is coming. I can practically taste the experience points. They taste like copper and bad decisions.\" \n\nI swung again, the numbers popping in the air like neon confetti. This wasn't just a fight; it was a grind. And in this world, the grind was the only thing that kept you from becoming part of the scenery.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"characters\": {\n    \"count\": 5,\n    \"status\": \"READY\",\n    \"updated_at\": \"2026-02-06T21:45:27Z\"\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 3\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_001/scene_003.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"DRAFTING\",\n  \"summary\": {\n    \"chapter_so_far\": [\n      \"Artie has died on Earth and entered the System's character creation void after a vending machine accident.\",\n      \"Artie met his guide, Fizz, and reviewed the details of his death.\",\n      \"Artie exploited the character creation system to create a high-variance 'Crit-Only' build.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_facts_ring\": [\n      \"Artie confronted the Snack-O-Matic 3000 over a stuck bag of Zesty Ranch Habanero Hoops.\",\n      \"Artie attempted to rock the vending machine to dislodge his snack, triggering a massive power surge.\",\n      \"The electrical surge electrocuted Artie, leading to his physical death.\",\n      \"The System issued a notification declaring Artie 'TERMINATED' due to a critical error.\",\n      \"Artie's consciousness transitioned into 'The Great Login Screen in the Sky' white void.\",\n      \"Artie's corporate attire and wallet were converted into fantasy starter equipment.\",\n      \"Artie manifested in the void holding a Broken Tutorial Sword.\",\n      \"milestone: artie_died = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: system_login = DONE\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Broken Tutorial Sword (carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Linen Tunic (equipped, container=body)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Single Copper Coin (stowed, container=pockets)\",\n      \"location: The System Void (current status)\",\n      \"Fizz introduced herself as Artie's System Liaison and mocked his cause of death.\",\n      \"Artie reviewed his official [System Notification: Death Report].\",\n      \"The [Character Creation] menu was opened with 50 available points.\",\n      \"Artie reduced Strength, Agility, Intelligence, and Vitality to 1 to maximize Luck to 99.\",\n      \"Artie acquired the titles 'Statistical Anomaly' and 'The Glassest Cannon'.\",\n      \"Artie's final stats were confirmed as 1 HP, 1 MP, and 100% Critical Hit Rate.\",\n      \"Deployment to the tutorial zone, The Whispering Woods, was initiated.\",\n      \"milestone: build_confirmed = DONE\",\n      \"location: The System Void (status: transitioning to Whispering Woods)\"\n    ],\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie met his System Liaison, Fizz, in the white void and reviewed his embarrassing death report involving a vending machine.\",\n      \"Despite Fizz's warnings about the 'trap stat', Artie drained his physical and mental attributes to the minimum to maximize his Luck.\",\n      \"This resulted in a 'Statistical Anomaly' build with 1 HP and a guaranteed 100% Critical Hit rate.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"milestone: artie_died = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: system_login = DONE\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Broken Tutorial Sword (carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Linen Tunic (equipped, container=body)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Single Copper Coin (stowed, container=pockets)\",\n      \"location: The System Void (current status)\",\n      \"milestone: build_confirmed = DONE\",\n      \"location: The System Void (status: transitioning to Whispering Woods)\"\n    ],\n    \"pending_story_rollups\": [],\n    \"story_so_far\": []\n  },\n  \"world\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"CHAR_FIZZ\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"The System Void\",\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"\n    ],\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie met his System Liaison, Fizz.\",\n      \"Fizz used her Data Slate to present Artie's death report.\",\n      \"Artie intentionally drained his base stats to 1 to maximize his Luck stat.\",\n      \"Artie confirmed a 'Crit-Only' build with 1 HP and 100% Critical Hit Rate.\",\n      \"Deployment to The Whispering Woods has been initiated.\"\n    ],\n    \"time\": {}\n  }\n}\n\nOutput (required, no code fences):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n"
