      "message": "The post-patch candidate state for CHAR_ARTIE is incoherent. The character's internal 'invariants' list claims the 'crumpled dollar bill' is 'carried' in 'hand_right', the 'cracked smartphone' is 'stowed' in 'pocket_right', and the 'leather wallet' is 'stowed' in 'pocket_left'. However, the authoritative MUST_STAY_TRUE block (and the pre-state) explicitly marks these items as 'lost' or 'dropped' in the 'world'. Furthermore, the character's 'inventory' array and the scene prose correctly show 'hand_right' is occupied by the 'Participation Trophy', contradicting the 'carried' status for the dollar bill in the character's invariant list.",
