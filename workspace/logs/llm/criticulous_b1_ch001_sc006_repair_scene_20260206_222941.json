  "text": "COMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: SC_001_006\nAllowed events: Artie flees the Whispering Woods, reaches Oakhaven gates, undergoes gate scan, scanner malfunctions due to 100% Crit and 1 HP, Artie receives 'Statistical Anomaly' tag, Artie enters Oakhaven.\nForbidden milestones: None.\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: hand_right=Broken Tutorial Sword, hand_left=Participation Trophy (carried/soul-bound).\n\nPROSE:\nArtie\u2019s lungs felt like they had been scrubbed with industrial-grade sandpaper and then set on fire. Every breath was a jagged reminder that a Dexterity score of two\u2014even with the \"Pity Bonus\" he\u2019d clawed out of the System\u2019s cold, dead hands\u2014was not built for a cross-country sprint. He scrambled over a moss-covered log, his right hand white-knuckling the Broken Tutorial Sword while his left hand remained fused to the glowing, golden weight of the Participation Trophy.\n\n[Stamina: 9/100]\n[Status: Winded (Recovery Rate -50%)]\n\n\"Faster, Artie! It\u2019s gaining! And by 'it,' I mean the entire local ecosystem!\" Fizz hovered alongside him, her wings a blur of cyan pixels. She wasn't running, of course. She was a guide. She just floated there, looking professionally concerned while Artie did all the dying.\n\nBehind them, the Level 4 Tutorial Wolf let out a howl that sounded less like a predator and more like a dial-up modem screaming at a wall. It wasn't just the wolf. Thanks to the gold-plated monstrosity fused to Artie's left hand, he had a trail of angry slimes, two disgruntled squirrels, and a very confused-looking badger following him like he was the messiah of the misunderstood. The physical contact with the trailing edge of a Level 1 Slime\u2014a sticky, acidic sensation against his heel\u2014finally snapped as he put on a desperate burst of speed.\n\nThe Participation Trophy hummed. It didn't just vibrate; it sang with the frequency of a thousand \"You Tried\" stickers. \n\n[Participation Trophy (Cursed/Soul-bound)]\n[Effect: Aura of the Beacon (+500% Aggro)]\n[Effect: Magnetic Failure (Projectile Attraction)]\n\n\"I hate this thing,\" Artie wheezed, his boots skidding on the gravel as the treeline finally broke. \"I hate the System. I hate math.\"\n\n\"Math loves you, Artie! It just has a very aggressive way of showing it!\" Fizz pointed ahead. \"Look! The Oakhaven Safe Zone! If we cross the threshold, the aggro-leash should snap!\"\n\nThe gates of Oakhaven weren't just wood and iron. They were a sprawling monument to the System\u2019s obsession with order. Massive white stone pillars rose from the earth, inscribed with glowing blue runes that pulsed in time with the world\u2019s heartbeat. Above the archway, a massive floating UI display read: [WELCOME TO OAKHAVEN - POPULATION: 1,242 (98.4% STABLE)].\n\nArtie didn't care about the stability. He cared about the invisible line in the dirt. He threw himself forward, the wolf lunging behind him, its jaws snapping inches from his Linen Tunic. If those teeth touched him, he was gone. One hit point. One. He was a soap bubble in a world made of needles.\n\nHe crossed the line.\n\n*BZZZT.*\n\nThe wolf hit an invisible wall of shimmering blue force and bounced backward, its snarl turning into a series of glitched whimpers. The slimes and the badger followed suit, piling up against the barrier like a crowd at a sold-out concert.\n\n[Entering: Oakhaven (Safe Zone)]\n[Aggro Cleared. Welcome, Traveler.]\n\nArtie collapsed onto the cobbles, the Participation Trophy clattering against the stones. It didn't fall out of his hand, of course. It was soul-bound. It just sat there, glowing with a smug, golden light, attracting the curious stares of a few nearby NPCs.\n\n\"We... we made it,\" Artie gasped, watching his stamina bar begin its agonizingly slow crawl back toward double digits.\n\n\"Don't get too comfortable,\" Fizz said, landing on his shoulder. \"We still have to pass the Gate Scanner. And usually, the System likes its travelers to have, you know, more than one hit point and a luck stat that doesn't look like a typo.\"\n\nArtie looked up. Suspended from the center of the gate\u2019s arch was a massive, crystalline eye. It wasn't a biological eye; it was a multifaceted diamond that rotated with a series of mechanical clicks. As he stood up, the eye swiveled toward him. A beam of pale green light shot out, sweeping from his boots to his head.\n\n[Initiating Standard Entry Scan...]\n[Analyzing Player Data: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon...]\n[Level: 2]\n[Class: N/A (Unassigned)]\n\nThe green light hit the Participation Trophy. The beam immediately flickered, turning a sickly shade of yellow. \n\n\"Oh, here we go,\" Fizz muttered, her Data Slate beginning to spark.\n\n[Warning: High-Level Aggro-Beacon Detected.]\n[Analyzing Item: Participation Trophy...]\n[Result: Cursed. Soul-bound. Tier 3 System Error Source.]\n\nThe scanner\u2019s mechanical clicking accelerated. The green light turned a violent, pulsing red. The floating UI display above the gate began to scroll through text at a speed that made Artie's head spin.\n\n[Error: Statistical Inconsistency Detected.]\n[Checking HP...]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Result: Within Bounds (Technically).]\n\n[Checking Luck...]\n[Luck: 104]\n[Result: Out of Range for Level 2. Recalculating...]\n\n[Checking Critical Hit Rate...]\n[Crit Rate: 100%]\n[Result: FATAL ERROR.]\n\n\"Fizz, what\u2019s it doing?\" Artie asked, backing away as the crystalline eye began to smoke.\n\n\"It's trying to find a category for you!\" she shouted over the rising whine of the scanner. \"The System hates anomalies, Artie! It wants everyone in a neat little box! A 'Warrior' box or a 'Mage' box! You\u2019re a 'One-Hit-Point-Walking-Nuclear-Option' box!\"\n\nTwo guards in polished silver plate armor stepped forward, their hands on the pommels of their swords. Above their heads, their tags read [Oakhaven Gate Guard - Lvl 25]. They looked bored, but as the scanner began to wail, that boredom shifted into visible confusion.\n\n\"Identify yourself, traveler!\" the lead guard shouted. \"And put that... whatever that golden thing is... away!\"\n\n\"I can't!\" Artie yelled back, holding up his left hand. \"It's stuck! It's a reward! Sort of!\"\n\nThe scanner reached a crescendo. A bolt of red energy shot from the eye, striking the ground in front of Artie and forming a massive, shimmering holographic window that everyone in the vicinity could see.\n\n[CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE: DATA OVERFLOW]\n[Subject: CHAR_ARTIE]\n[Logic Loop: 100% Crit + 1 HP = Does Not Compute.]\n[Applying Emergency Classification...]\n\nThe red light suddenly vanished, replaced by a dull, persistent purple glow that settled over Artie like a heavy blanket. He felt a weight on his chest, not physical, but digital. A new icon appeared next to his name in his peripheral vision.\n\n[New Title Assigned: Statistical Anomaly]\n[Description: You are a glitch in the grand design. A rounding error with a pulse. The System cannot account for your existence, so it has simply decided to label you 'Problematic.']\n\n[Entry Permitted (Under Protest).]\n\nThe guards looked at the purple tag hovering over Artie's head. They looked at each other. The lead guard sighed and stepped aside.\n\n\"An Anomaly, huh?\" he muttered, shaking his head. \"Great. Another one of those. Just don't go critting the fountain, kid. The Mayor hates cleaning up the logic-leaks.\"\n\nThe gates groaned open, revealing the bustling streets of Oakhaven. \n\n\"See?\" Fizz said, her wings fluttering with relief. \"Entry granted. And you only broke one automated security system to do it. That\u2019s a new personal record.\"\n\nArtie looked at the purple 'Statistical Anomaly' tag reflecting in a nearby puddle. It pulsed with a steady, rhythmic light, marking him as something different, something broken.\n\n\"I have a feeling,\" Artie said, stepping into the city, \"that 'under protest' is going to be the theme of my life here.\"\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"location\": \"Oakhaven\",\n    \"cast_present\": [\"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"CHAR_FIZZ\"],\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie fled the Whispering Woods mobs and reached the Oakhaven Safe Zone.\",\n      \"The Oakhaven gate scanner malfunctioned while processing Artie's 100% Crit rate and 1 HP.\",\n      \"The System assigned Artie the 'Statistical Anomaly' title to resolve the data overflow.\",\n      \"Artie was granted entry to Oakhaven 'under protest' by the gate guards.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"character_stat_updates\": {\n    \"CHAR_ARTIE\": {\n      \"luck\": 104,\n      \"dexterity\": 2,\n      \"stamina\": 24,\n      \"hp\": 1,\n      \"max_hp\": 1,\n      \"level\": 2,\n      \"crit_rate\": 100\n    }\n  },\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 6,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\"item\": \"Broken Tutorial Sword\", \"container\": \"hand_right\", \"status\": \"carried\"},\n        {\"item\": \"Linen Tunic\", \"container\": \"body\", \"status\": \"equipped\"},\n        {\"item\": \"Single Copper Coin\", \"container\": \"pockets\", \"status\": \"stowed\"},\n        {\"item\": \"Participation Trophy\", \"container\": \"hand_left\", \"status\": \"carried\"}\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\"container\": \"hand_right\", \"location\": \"arm_right\", \"contents\": [\"Broken Tutorial Sword\"]},\n        {\"container\": \"hand_left\", \"location\": \"arm_left\", \"contents\": [\"Participation Trophy\"]},\n        {\"container\": \"body\", \"location\": \"torso\", \"contents\": [\"Linen Tunic\"]},\n        {\"container\": \"pockets\", \"location\": \"legs\", \"contents\": [\"Single Copper Coin\"]}\n      ],\n      \"invariants_add\": [\n        \"milestone: oakhaven_entry = DONE\",\n        \"milestone: statistical_anomaly_tagged = DONE\",\n        \"title: Statistical Anomaly\",\n        \"location: Oakhaven\"\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie is beginning to accept his role as a System-breaking anomaly.\",\n        \"Artie views 'under protest' as his new baseline for interacting with the world.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie fled the Whispering Woods and reached the safety of Oakhaven's gates.\",\n      \"The gate scanner malfunctioned due to Artie's impossible stats, resulting in him being tagged as a 'Statistical Anomaly'.\",\n      \"He was allowed entry into the city despite the System's protests.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Artie escaped the Level 4 Tutorial Wolf and the aggro-swarm from the woods.\",\n      \"Artie reached the Oakhaven Safe Zone, clearing the monster aggro.\",\n      \"The Oakhaven gate scanner failed to categorize Artie's 100% Crit and 1 HP build.\",\n      \"The System assigned Artie the 'Statistical Anomaly' title.\",\n      \"Artie entered Oakhaven, officially ending his time in the tutorial wilderness.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Broken Tutorial Sword (carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Participation Trophy (carried, container=hand_left)\",\n      \"milestone: oakhaven_entry = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: statistical_anomaly_tagged = DONE\",\n      \"location: Oakhaven\",\n      \"title: Statistical Anomaly\",\n      \"Artie has 1 HP and 100% Crit Rate.\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Artie reached Oakhaven and was flagged as a Statistical Anomaly by the gate scanners.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nMechanics contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and labels (stats/skills) must be sourced from state or explicitly updated in the state_patch. Do not invent numbers or canonical tokens.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the RNG-Hellscape\",\"goal\":\"Introduce Artie and his

set on fire. Every breath was a jagged reminder that a Dexterity score of two\u2014even with the \"Pity Bonus\" I\u2019d clawed out of the System\u2019s cold, dead hands\u2014was not built for a cross-country sprint.\n\n[Stamina: 9/100]\n[Status: Winded (Recovery Rate -50%)]\n\n\"Faster, Artie! It\u2019s gaining! And by 'it,' I mean the entire local ecosystem!\" Fizz hovered alongside me, her wings a blur of cyan pixels. She wasn't running, of course. She was a guide. She just floated there, looking professionally concerned while I did all the dying.\n\nBehind us, the Level 4 Tutorial Wolf let out a howl that sounded less like a predator and more like a dial-up modem screaming at a wall. It wasn't just the wolf. Thanks to the gold-plated monstrosity fused to my left hand, I had a trail of angry slimes, two disgruntled squirrels, and a very confused-looking badger following me like I was the messiah of the misunderstood.\n\nThe Participation Trophy hummed. It didn't just vibrate; it sang with the frequency of a thousand \"You Tried\" stickers. \n\n[Participation Trophy (Cursed/Soul-bound)]\n[Effect: Aura of the Beacon (+500% Aggro)]\n[Effect: Magnetic Failure (Projectile Attraction)]\n\n\"I hate this thing,\" I wheezed, my boots skidding on the gravel as the treeline finally broke. \"I hate the System. I hate math.\"\n\n\"Math loves you, Artie! It just has a very aggressive way of showing it!\" Fizz pointed ahead. \"Look! The Oakhaven Safe Zone! If we cross the threshold, the aggro-leash should snap!\"\n\nThe gates of Oakhaven weren't just wood and iron. They were a sprawling monument to the System\u2019s obsession with order. Massive white stone pillars rose from the earth, inscribed with glowing blue runes that pulsed in time with the world\u2019s heartbeat. Above the archway, a massive floating UI display read: [WELCOME TO OAKHAVEN - POPULATION: 1,242 (98.4% STABLE)].\n\nI didn't care about the stability. I cared about the invisible line in the dirt.\n\nI threw myself forward, my right hand white-knuckling the Broken Tutorial Sword. The wolf lunged, its jaws snapping inches from my Linen Tunic. If those teeth touched me, I was gone. One hit point. One. I was a soap bubble in a world made of needles.\n\nI crossed the line.\n\n*BZZZT.*\n\nThe wolf hit an invisible wall of shimmering blue force and bounced backward, its snarl turning into a series of glitched whimpers. The slimes and the badger followed suit, piling up against the barrier like a crowd at a sold-out concert.\n\n[Entering: Oakhaven (Safe Zone)]\n[Aggro Cleared. Welcome, Traveler.]\n\nI collapsed onto the cobbles, the Participation Trophy clattering against the stones. It didn't fall out of my hand, of course. It was soul-bound. It just sat there, glowing with a smug, golden light, attracting the curious stares of a few nearby NPCs.\n\n\"We... we made it,\" I gasped, watching my stamina bar begin its agonizingly slow crawl back toward double digits.\n\n\"Don't get too comfortable,\" Fizz said, landing on my shoulder. \"We still have to pass the Gate Scanner. And usually, the System likes its travelers to have, you know, more than one hit point and a luck stat that doesn't look like a typo.\"\n\nI looked up. Suspended from the center of the gate\u2019s arch was a massive, crystalline eye. It wasn't a biological eye; it was a multifaceted diamond that rotated with a series of mechanical clicks. As I stood up, the eye swiveled toward me.\n\nA beam of pale green light shot out, sweeping from my boots to my head.\n\n[Initiating Standard Entry Scan...]\n[Analyzing Player Data: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon...]\n[Level: 2]\n[Class: N/A (Unassigned)]\n\nThe green light hit the Participation Trophy. The beam immediately flickered, turning a sickly shade of yellow. \n\n\"Oh, here we go,\" Fizz muttered, her Data Slate beginning to spark.\n\n[Warning: High-Level Aggro-Beacon Detected.]\n[Analyzing Item: Participation Trophy...]\n[Result: Cursed. Soul-bound. Tier 3 System Error Source.]\n\nThe scanner\u2019s mechanical clicking accelerated. The green light turned a violent, pulsing red. The floating UI display above the gate began to scroll through text at a speed that made my head spin.\n\n[Error: Statistical Inconsistency Detected.]\n[Checking HP...]\n[Value: 1/1]\n[Result: Within Bounds (Technically).]\n\n[Checking Luck...]\n[Value: 104]\n[Result: Out of Range for Level 2. Recalculating...]\n\n[Checking Critical Hit Rate...]\n[Value: 100%]\n[Result: FATAL ERROR.]\n\n\"Fizz, what\u2019s it doing?\" I asked, backing away as the crystalline eye began to smoke.\n\n\"It's trying to find a category for you!\" she shouted over the rising whine of the scanner. \"The System hates anomalies, Artie! It wants everyone in a neat little box! A 'Warrior' box or a 'Mage' box! You\u2019re a 'One-Hit-Point-Walking-Nuclear-Option' box!\"\n\nTwo guards in polished silver plate armor stepped forward, their hands on the pommels of their swords. Above their heads, their tags read [Oakhaven Gate Guard - Lvl 25]. They looked bored, but as the scanner began to wail, that boredom shifted into visible confusion.\n\n\"Identify yourself, traveler!\" the lead guard shouted. \"And put that... whatever that golden thing is... away!\"\n\n\"I can't!\" I yelled back, holding up my left hand. \"It's stuck! It's a reward! Sort of!\"\n\nThe scanner reached a crescendo. A bolt of red energy shot from the eye, striking the ground in front of me and forming a massive, shimmering holographic window that everyone in the vicinity could see.\n\n[CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE: DATA OVERFLOW]\n[Subject: CHAR_ARTIE]\n[Logic Loop: 100% Crit + 1 HP = Does Not Compute.]\n[Applying Emergency Classification...]\n\nThe red light suddenly vanished, replaced by a dull, persistent purple glow that settled over me like a heavy blanket. I felt a weight on my chest, not physical, but digital. A new icon appeared next to my name in my peripheral vision.\n\n[New Title Assigned: Statistical Anomaly]\n[Description: You are a glitch in the grand design. A rounding error with a pulse. The System cannot account for your existence, so it has simply decided to label you 'Problematic.']\n\n[Entry Permitted (Under Protest).]\n\nThe guards looked at the purple tag hovering over my head. They looked at each other. The lead guard sighed and stepped aside.\n\n\"An Anomaly, huh?\" he muttered, shaking his head. \"Great. Another one of those. Just don't go critting the fountain, kid. The Mayor hates cleaning up the logic-leaks.\"\n\nThe gates groaned open, revealing the bustling streets of Oakhaven. \n\n\"See?\" Fizz said, her wings fluttering with relief. \"Entry granted. And you only broke one automated security system to do it. That\u2019s a new personal record.\"\n\nI looked at the purple 'Statistical Anomaly' tag reflecting in a nearby puddle. It pulsed with a steady, rhythmic light, marking me as something different, something broken.\n\n\"I have a feeling,\" I said, stepping into the city, \"that 'under protest' is going to be the theme of my life here.\"\n\n[Level 2 reached: Confirmed]\n[Participation Trophy: Still stuck.]\n[Oakhaven: Entered.]\n\nThe hunt for a way to survive with 1 HP had officially begun, and now, everyone in the city knew exactly who the glitch was.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"characters\": {\n    \"count\": 5,\n    \"status\": \"READY\",\n    \"updated_at\": \"2026-02-06T21:45:27Z\"\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 6\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_001/scene_006.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"run_stats\": {},\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"DRAFTING\",\n  \"summary\": {\n    \"chapter_so_far\": [\n      \"Artie has died on Earth and entered the System's character creation void after a vending machine accident.\",\n      \"Artie met his guide, Fizz, and reviewed the details of his death.\",\n      \"Artie exploited the character creation system to create a high-variance 'Crit-Only' build.\",\n      \"Artie entered the Whispering Woods and engaged in his first combat encounter.\",\n      \"Artie discovered that the System's rounding mechanics make his 1 HP build extremely fragile.\",\n      \"Artie survived his first combat encounter by accidentally nuking the tutorial zone.\",\n      \"Artie discovered that his crits can overwrite System rules and destroy world objects.\",\n      \"Artie received a cursed Participation Trophy that makes him a magnet for all monsters and projectiles in the area.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_facts_ring\": [\n      \"The Whispering Woods are mechanically hostile and recite patch notes.\",\n      \"Artie missed the Level 1 Slime 5 times due to his 1 Dexterity stat.\",\n      \"The slime charged a Heavy Attack that threatened to dissolve Artie.\",\n      \"Artie landed a Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit on the slime's core, deleting the creature.\",\n      \"The resulting blast destroyed a Patch-Note Oak and carved a fifty-foot furrow into the earth.\",\n      \"Artie reached Level 2.\",\n      \"Artie's Luck increased to 104 and he received a +1 Dexterity 'Pity Bonus'.\",\n      \"The Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit ability entered a 24-hour cooldown.\",\n      \"milestone: slime_defeated = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: level_two_reached = DONE\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Broken Tutorial Sword (carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"Artie has 100% Critical Hit rate.\",\n      \"The Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit has a 24-hour cooldown.\",\n      \"Artie received the 'Participation Trophy' (Cursed/Soul-bound) as an achievement for causing a Tier 3 System Error.\",\n      \"Fizz identified the trophy's hidden stats: Aura of the Beacon (+500% aggro) and Magnetic Failure (projectile attraction).\",\n      \"A Level 4 Tutorial Wolf and a swarm of other mobs aggroed on Artie due to the trophy's effects.\",\n      \"Artie fled North toward a ravine as the tutorial zone's stability dropped to 84%.\",\n      \"Artie narrowly dodged a slime projectile that curved toward him due to the trophy's Magnetic Failure.\",\n      \"Artie's stamina dropped to 42/100 during the frantic retreat.\",\n      \"milestone: artie_died = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: participation_trophy_acquired = DONE\",\n      \"Artie has 1 HP and 1 MP;
