    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\n\ufeffOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}]\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the

        "content": "# REPAIR\n\nFix the scene based on lint issues.\nSummaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\nTimeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: pre-scene invariants and summary facts are binding unless the Scene Card depicts a change. If this scene changes a durable fact, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value and remove the old entry.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n- must_stay_true removal (mandatory when a durable fact is superseded):\n  - Add \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" in summary_update.must_stay_true.\n  - Place REMOVE lines before the new final invariant.\n  - REMOVE lines also apply to key_facts_ring (purge stale facts from continuity).\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\nFor held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\nContinuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.\n- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.\n- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.\n- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or '(locked)' only.\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nCanonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\nIf item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for authoritative labels and custody terms.\nUse item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If a durable appearance change occurs in this scene, record it in character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- APPEARANCE_CHECK is required in COMPLIANCE for each cast_present_id (4-8 tokens from atoms/marks).\n\nNaming repairs:\n- If lint flags an item naming issue, fix it with minimal edits.\n- Do not remove humor; simply anchor the item (add display_name near first mention) and ensure custody-change sentences include the display_name.\n- Do not rename item_id or registry fields; only adjust prose wording.\nsummary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\nSTATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nmust_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nIf state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nEnforce scene-card durable constraints: `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\nRespect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`.\n- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):\n  - If timeline_scope != \"present\" OR ontological_scope != \"real\", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).\n  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.\n  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category=\"timeline_override\".\nReturn corrected prose plus a corrected state_patch JSON block.\n\nOutput format (required, no code fences, no commentary):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n\nAPPEARANCE_CHECK:\n- CHAR_ID: <4-8 tokens from atoms/marks>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects.

\"updated_at\": \"2026-02-12T18:08:14Z\"\n  }\n]\n\nScene:\nThe siren didn't just wail; it shrieked with the digital agony of a thousand dying hard drives. Every time the red light pulsed against the white stone walls of Oakhaven\u2019s main thoroughfare, Artie\u2019s vision flickered, his retinas burning with the afterimage of a system that was currently having a collective nervous breakdown. \n\n[SYSTEM ALERT: STATISTICAL ANOMALY DETECTED]\n[CRITICAL ERROR: DATA INTEGRITY COMPROMISED]\n[LOCATION: OAKHAVEN - SECTOR 01]\n\n\"Can we turn that off? Seriously, I think I\u2019m getting a migraine, and with my health pool, a migraine might actually be fatal!\" Artie shouted, his voice cracking over the rhythmic thumping of the alarm. \n\nHe gripped the Participation Trophy tighter in his right hand. The gold-plated monstrosity, shaped like a hand patting a smaller, sadder hand, felt like it was vibrating. It wasn't just a reward; it was a lightning rod. The \"Center of Attention\" buff was working overtime, and Artie could feel the weight of a thousand curious eyes pressing into his back like physical needles.\n\n\"Turn it off?\" A new voice, smooth as churned butter and twice as oily, cut through the noise. \"My boy, you don't turn off a divine revelation. You index it. You study it. You tax it.\"\n\nThe crowd of panicked travelers and gawking merchants parted like the Red Sea, or at least like a bunch of people who didn't want to get stepped on by the line of stiff-backed guards marching into the square. At their head walked a man who seemed to have been designed by someone with a very specific interest in the 'Portly Bureaucrat' aesthetic. \n\n[Mayor of Oakhaven - Lvl 15] [HP: 80/80]\n\nThe Mayor of Oakhaven was short, his ruddy face glistening with a thin sheen of sweat that suggested he\u2019d run here the moment the scanners started screaming. He wore a heavy Oakhaven Sash of Office draped across his torso, the silk so thick it looked like it could stop a crossbow bolt, and a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of his nose. \n\nArtie froze. His heart hammered against his ribs\u2014a dangerous activity for a man with a single hit point.\n\n[Aggro Meter: CRITICAL]\n[Warning: High-Level NPC is 'Predatorily Curious'. Physical contact may result in accidental deletion.]\n\n\"I... I was just passing through,\" Artie said, trying to tuck the Participation Trophy behind his back. It didn't work. The trophy\u2019s glow only intensified, casting a sickly yellow light over his lanky frame and messy brown hair. \"I have a permit. Well, the guards let me in. That counts as a permit, right?\"\n\nThe Mayor stopped three paces away, his watery brown eyes narrowing as they scanned Artie from head to toe. He didn't look at Artie\u2019s face; he looked at the space just above Artie\u2019s head, where the System tags were currently flickering like a neon sign in a rainstorm.\n\n\"Arthur Penhaligon,\" the Mayor read aloud, his voice dropping into a register of pure, unadulterated greed. \"Level 2. Human. And a title that makes my internal ledger sing like a choir of angels.\"\n\n[Title Detected: Statistical Anomaly]\n[Crit Rate: 100.00% (locked)]\n[HP: 1/1 (locked)]\n\n\"It's a typo,\" Artie blurted out. \"The character creator froze. I was trying to click 'Balanced Build' and I think I hit the 'Everything is Terrible' button by mistake. I\u2019m actually very fragile. If you sneeze too hard in my general direction, I\u2019ll probably explode into loot.\"\n\nThe Mayor chuckled, a wet, rattling sound that did nothing to settle Artie\u2019s nerves. He adjusted his gold-rimmed spectacles, leaning in close enough that Artie could smell the expensive pipe tobacco and desperation clinging to his robes. \n\n\"Fragility is a matter of perspective, Arthur. In the Whispering Woods, you are a snack. But here? In the City of Chance?\" The Mayor gestured to the surrounding spires, where the architecture itself seemed to be built on the logic of a casino floor. \"Here, you are a miracle. Do you have any idea what the House of Odds would pay for a guaranteed result? A one-hundred-percent certainty in a world built on the roll of a die?\"\n\nArtie took a half-step back, his heel catching on a cobblestone. \n\n[Stamina: 38/100]\n[Warning: Minor stumble detected. Potential for 1 DMG on impact.]\n\nHe flailed his left hand, steadying himself against the air as if he could grab onto the UI itself. \"I\u2019m not a gambler. I\u2019m a... I\u2019m a consultant. An office drone. I just want to find a quest that involves sitting in a very padded chair.\"\n\n\"You are a Market Disruptor,\" the Mayor corrected, his smile widening to reveal teeth that had clearly been polished by high-level dental magic. \"Oakhaven is the heart of the System\u2019s economy because we manage risk. But you? You don't have risk. You have a result. You are the only stable currency in a world of floating point variables.\"\n\nThe alarm finally cut out, replaced by a silence that was somehow much louder. The guards shifted, their hands resting on the pommels of their swords, and the crowd began to press closer. Artie realized then that the 'Statistical Anomaly' title wasn't just a bug report. it was a bounty. It was a beacon. \n\nEvery merchant wanting a perfect craft, every gambler wanting a perfect roll, and every tyrant wanting a perfect strike was going to see him as the ultimate tool. \n\n\"I think,\" Artie whispered, his hazel eyes wide as he looked at the hungry expressions surrounding him, \"that I\u2019ve made a very big mistake.\"\n\n\"Mistake?\" The Mayor reached out, his hand hovering inches from Artie\u2019s shoulder. \"My dear boy, you\u2019ve just become the most valuable property in Oakhaven. Now, shall we discuss your... 'indexing' fee? Or should I let the guards explain the local laws regarding unregistered glitches?\"\n\n[New Objective: Escape the 'Index']\n[Current Threat Level: Bureaucratic Extinction]\n\nArtie looked at the Participation Trophy in his right hand, then at the Mayor's gold-rimmed spectacles, and finally at the exit gates he had just entered through. The gates were closed. The city was a trap, and he was the cheese.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n
