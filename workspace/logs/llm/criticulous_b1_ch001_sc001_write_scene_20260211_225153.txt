PROSE:

The fluorescent light above the vending machine flickered with a rhythmic, dying buzz that matched the throbbing behind my eyes. It was 11:47 PM. I had been in this cubicle-hell for fourteen hours, and the only thing standing between me and a complete psychological collapse was a bag of Extreme-Zesty Ranch Corn Chips.

I looked down at my right hand. I was holding the crumpled dollar bill like it was a holy relic. It was limp, damp with the sweat of a man who had spent the last twenty minutes digging through his car's floor mats for loose change, and featured a tear along George Washington’s neck that looked suspiciously like a foreshadowing of my own career path.

"Don't you do it," I whispered to the machine. "Not tonight, Brutus."

The machine, a Model 4000 Snack-Master that smelled faintly of ozone and regret, hummed back at me. Its internal cooling fan sounded like a jet engine trying to take off in a vat of pudding. I took a breath, smoothed the crumpled dollar bill against the cold glass of the machine’s front, and fed it into the bill validator.

The machine whirred. It took the bill halfway, hesitated, and then spat it back out with a sound of pure, mechanical disgust.

[Outcome: Critical Rejection]

I blinked. I wasn't sure if I was hallucinating the floating text or if the lack of sleep had finally cracked my perception of reality. The words were a translucent, neon blue, hovering just at the edge of my vision. I shook my head, but they didn't disappear. They just drifted slightly to the left, bobbing like a buoy in a sea of fluorescent static.

"Great," I muttered, reaching into my pocket to pat my leather wallet. It was empty, save for a dry-cleaning receipt and a loyalty card for a coffee shop that had gone out of business in 2019. I checked my other pocket, feeling the cold, shattered screen of my cracked smartphone. No help there. It was just me and the bill.

I smoothed the crumpled dollar bill again, using the edge of the machine's coin slot to flatten the creases. I tried to be gentle. I tried to be seductive. I fed it back in.

The machine swallowed it. The validator groaned, the gears gnashing together, and then—silence. 

No credit appeared on the LED display. The number '0.00' stared back at me, mocking my existence.

"Hey!" I barked, slapping the glass. "That was my last buck! Give it back!"

I pressed the coin return button. Nothing. I mashed it. The button was sticky, probably coated in a decade’s worth of spilled soda and failure. I leaned my forehead against the glass, looking at the Extreme-Zesty Ranch Corn Chips hanging precariously from the metal coil at position D4. They were so close. 

[Vending Machine - Lvl 0 (Inanimate)]
[HP: 10/10]
[Status: Indifferent]

There it was again. The UI. It was labeling the machine like a boss in an RPG. I laughed, a dry, hacking sound that felt like swallowing sandpaper. If I was going crazy, at least my brain was being thematic about it. 

"Fine," I said, stepping back and rolling up the sleeves of my wrinkled dress shirt. "We're doing this the hard way."

I balled my right hand into a fist. I wasn't a fighter. I was a guy who spent his days reconciling spreadsheets and his nights wondering where it all went wrong. But I wanted those chips. 

I punched the machine’s side, right where the "Push for Change" sticker was peeling off.

[Attack: Unarmed Strike]
[Damage: 0]
[Status Effect: Glitched: Crit-Only (Active)]

The impact jolted up my arm, but the machine didn't even rattle. The blue text popped up again, flashing a zero so large it felt personal. I hit it again. Left hook. Right cross. A desperate, two-handed shove.

[Damage: 0]
[Damage: 0]
[Damage: 0]

"What do you mean, zero?" I yelled at the empty breakroom. "I'm hitting it! It’s a physical object! Physics! Look it up!"

I was panting now. My Agility was clearly not up to the task of urban combat. I looked at the machine, and for a second, I could swear the humming changed pitch. It went from a low drone to a high-pitched whine, like a capacitor charging up for something big.

[Warning: Environmental Hazard Detected]
[Status: Critical Fault in Progress]

"I just want my chips," I whimpered. I gave the machine one final, frustrated kick. My foot connected with the base of the unit, right where a frayed power cord snaked out from underneath the metal chassis.

There was a pop. A bright, blue spark jumped from the cord to my damp shoe.

[Critical Hit Received! -10 HP]

The world didn't just go dark; it went electric. A surge of white-hot agony tore through my legs, up my spine, and out through the top of my skull. It felt like my nervous system was being used as a guitar string for a heavy metal solo played by a god of lightning. 

I fell back, my limbs jerking in a dance I hadn't rehearsed. My cracked smartphone flew out of my pocket, clattering across the linoleum. My leather wallet followed, spilling its useless contents. 

I hit the floor, my vision tunneling. The fluorescent lights above were spinning, turning into a kaleidoscope of flickering white bars. 

[HP: 0/10]
[Status: Deceased (Pending...)]

[System Notification: Unique Build Detected]
[Error: 100% Critical Hit Rate detected in non-combatant entity.]
[Recalculating...]

"Is... is that... it?" I gasped, though I wasn't sure if I was actually speaking or just thinking the words into the void. 

The vending machine loomed over me, a dark monolith in the flickering light. The Extreme-Zesty Ranch Corn Chips finally slipped from the coil, falling the six inches to the bottom tray with a soft, mocking *thud*. 

[Loading Screen...]
[Tip: Always check your surroundings for environmental hazards. Also, try not to die with zero gold. It’s embarrassing.]

The breakroom dissolved into a sea of gray pixels. The sound of the humming machine faded, replaced by a low, melodic chime—the kind of sound that usually precedes a very expensive microtransaction. 

My last thought, as the world faded to a loading bar that was stuck at 99%, was that I never even got to taste the ranch.
