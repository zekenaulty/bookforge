  "text": "PROSE:\nThe first sensation was not light, but the sound of his own heart. It was a slow, wet thud, echoing against the cage of his ribs like a hammer striking a muffled bell. It was a sound that should not exist, a rhythm long since surrendered to the stillness of the mountain.\n\nEldrin tried to draw breath, and the air that rushed in was a violent intrusion. It tasted of desiccated time and the mineral bite of deep-earth frost. His lungs, brittle and dry as ancient parchment, protested with a jagged, rattling cough that tore through the silence of the vault. The sound was alien to him, a harsh vibration in a world that had known only the hum of the ley-lines for an eternity.\n\nHe tried to move his hand. The command from his mind traveled through nerves that felt like frayed copper wires. His fingers, buried beneath a shroud of grey dust, twitched. The movement sent a cascade of fine grit skittering across the stone plinth. It was an agonizing process; every muscle had atrophied into something resembling cured leather, stiff and unyielding. The pain was sharp, a white-hot needle threading through his joints, but it was proof of life.\n\n*Where?* The thought was a fractured shard. \n\nHe opened his eyes. At first, there was only the oppressive weight of the dark, a velvet blackness so thick it felt tangible. Then, a faint, rhythmic pulse of amber light began to throb from the runes carved into the ceiling high above. They were dim, starved of the power that had once made them burn like suns, but they provided enough clarity to see the outlines of his tomb.\n\nHe was lying on a slab of black obsidian, his body draped in the tattered remains of robes that had once been the color of a summer sky. Now, they were merely grey webs, clinging to a frame that was little more than bone and resolve. \n\nMemory flickered\u2014a jagged montage of fire, the screaming of a sky torn asunder, and the cold, resolute faces of those who had sealed him here. They had called it a preservation. To Eldrin, it felt like a burial. \n\nHe rolled his shoulder, the bone popping with a sound like a dry branch snapping. He slid a leg off the obsidian slab, his foot meeting the floor. The stone was scarred by winds that had scoured centuries, etched with the geometric precision of a civilization that had worshipped order above all else. The air here hummed with that ancient, resonant cold\u2014a quality not of temperature but of time itself.\n\nA sudden vibration shivered through the floor. It wasn't the shifting of the mountain, but a resonance\u2014a harmonic frequency that tugged at the edges of his consciousness. Somewhere nearby, something had been disturbed. A fragment of the Lexicon? The thought brought a surge of adrenaline that tasted like copper in his mouth. \n\nHe forced himself upright. His vision swam, a kaleidoscope of grey and amber. He clutched the edge of the plinth, his knuckles white and skeletal. His legs shook, the tendons screaming as they took his weight for the first time in an age. He was a ghost trying to reclaim a body that had forgotten how to haunt the living.\n\n\"Stand,\" he whispered. His voice was a rasp, a dry scrape of wind over stone. \n\nHe pushed away from the obsidian. For a moment, he teetered on the precipice of collapse, his balance a forgotten art. He reached out, his hand brushing against a wall etched with the history of the Sage-Kings\u2014histories he had written, and histories he had failed to prevent. The stone felt vibrant under his touch, as if the mountain itself were holding its breath, waiting to see if he would fall.\n\nHe didn't. He took a step, then another, his movements jerky and uncoordinated. He was moving through a thicket of his own decay, shedding the lethargy of the long sleep. \n\nAs his eyes adjusted, he looked around the chamber. It was vast, a cathedral of silence carved into the peak of the world. Great pillars of basalt rose to meet the vaulted ceiling, their surfaces smooth and untouched by the ruin that had claimed the lands below. But as he scanned the shadows between the columns, the truth of his situation settled over him with a weight heavier than the mountain.\n\nThere were other plinths in the periphery of the amber light. Dozens of them, arranged in a perfect circle around his own. He dragged himself toward the nearest one, his breath coming in shallow, ragged gasps. \n\nThe figure on the second plinth was a husk. The preservation spells had failed, or perhaps they had never been intended to last this long. A handful of dust and a crown of tarnished silver were all that remained of the Arch-Magos. Eldrin moved to the next, and the next. \n\nVoid. Silence. Decay.\n\nHe reached the center of the chamber and turned in a slow, agonizing circle. The air was still. No other heart beat in the gloom. No other lungs fought the dust. The \"Awakened\" were supposed to be a legion, a final guard against the coming dark. Instead, he was a solitary spark in a cold hearth.\n\nThe realization hit him harder than the physical pain. He was the only living thing in the chamber. The sanctuary had become a sepulcher, and he was the only soul the mountain had seen fit to return.\n\nAbove him, the amber runes flickered and died, leaving him in a darkness that felt final. But in that darkness, the resonance from beyond the vault doors grew louder, a beckoning call from a world that had moved on without him.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 2\n  },\n  \"world\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"eldrin_sage\",\n      \"kaelen_scholar\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"The Sealed Vault, High Monastery\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Eldrin has awakened from a centuries-long stasis.\",\n      \"The other Sages in the vault did not survive the stasis; Eldrin is the sole survivor in the chamber.\",\n      \"Eldrin is in a state of extreme physical atrophy and fragmented memory.\",\n      \"A resonance, likely from Kaelen's Lexicon fragment, acted as a catalyst for Eldrin's awakening.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"th_lexicon_translation\",\n      \"th_celestial_omen\",\n      \"th_eldrin_recovery\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 0,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1\n  }\n}",

Weave a narrative rich with subtle foreshadowing and intricate plot threads, ensuring that major reveals feel earned and are judiciously hinted at throughout the text. Maintain a mythic and epic tone through descriptive language and thematic depth. Develop complex, morally ambiguous characters alongside clear heroes and villains, exploring their internal conflicts and motivations. Integrate world-building seamlessly, avoiding direct info-dumps. Vary sentence structure and pacing, using longer, flowing sentences for description and shorter, impactful ones for tension and revelation. Avoid deus ex machina, predictable character arcs, and simplistic moral resolutions. Focus on creating a layered reading experience where the importance of minor details becomes clear in surprising, satisfying ways, rewarding attentive readers.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\n",
