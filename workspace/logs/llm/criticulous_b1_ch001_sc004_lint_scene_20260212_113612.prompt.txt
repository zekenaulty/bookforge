# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
Prose hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative ("left hand", "right hand", "Artie", "his wallet").
Item naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.
Appearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Continuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.
Continuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.
Durable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.
JSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.
Inventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

﻿Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.
Durable vs ephemeral mechanics:
- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.
- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.
- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).
- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.
For durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
For durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).
Use canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.
- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.
  - INVALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": {"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}
  - VALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": [{"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}]


USER:

# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Classify UI/prose mechanic claims as DURABLE or EPHEMERAL before enforcing.
  - DURABLE: persistent stats/caps, skills/titles acquired, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, named mechanics referenced as invariants.
  - EPHEMERAL: roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat telemetry.
- Enforce DURABLE claims against authoritative_surfaces/state/registries.
- EPHEMERAL claims do not require state ownership; only flag EPHEMERAL contradictions inside the same scene as warnings.
- If uncertain, default to EPHEMERAL (warning at most), not DURABLE (error).
- status="fail" only if there is at least one issue with severity="error"; warnings alone => status="pass".
- Item naming enforcement scope:
  - Do not require that every mention in narrative prose use display_name.
  - Enforce canonical display_name for: (a) anchoring at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences),
    (b) any custody-change sentence (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer), and (c) any case where a descriptor is ambiguous among multiple durable items in the scene.
  - Otherwise, treat non-canonical descriptive references as warnings at most.
- Naming severity policy:
  - warning: unambiguous descriptor used post-anchor.
  - error: missing anchor, descriptor used during custody-change without canonical name, or ambiguity risk.

- Appearance enforcement (authoritative surface):
  - APPEARANCE_CHECK is authoritative for cast_present_ids.
  - Compare APPEARANCE_CHECK tokens to appearance_current atoms/marks (alias-aware).
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK contradicts appearance_current, emit error code "appearance_mismatch".
  - Prose-only appearance contradictions are warnings unless explicitly durable and uncorrected in-scene.
  - If prose depicts a durable appearance change but scene_card.durable_appearance_changes does not include it and no appearance_updates are present, emit error code "appearance_change_undeclared".
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK is missing for a cast member, emit warning code "appearance_check_missing".
- For authoritative surfaces, prefer exact canonical item/device labels from registries.
- For milestone repetition/future checks, compare against PRE-INVARIANTS only (pre-scene canon).
- For ownership/consistency checks, compare against POST-STATE (post-patch candidate).
- POST-STATE is canonical; character_states is a derived convenience view. If they contradict, emit pipeline_state_incoherent.
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).
  - Ignore first-person pronouns inside quoted dialogue; only narration counts.
- Deterministically enforce scene-card durable constraints (required_in_custody, required_scene_accessible, forbidden_visible, device_presence; optional required_visible_on_page).
- Durable constraint evaluation must use POST-STATE candidate (after patch), not pre-state.
- Report missing durable context ids with explicit retry hints instead of guessing canon.
- Input consistency check (mandatory, before issuing continuity/durable errors):
  - If MUST_STAY_TRUE invariants contradict the provided post-patch candidate character state, treat this as an upstream snapshot error.
  - In that case emit a single error issue with code "pipeline_state_incoherent" including evidence of the invariant and the conflicting state field.
  - Do NOT emit additional continuity errors for the same fields when pipeline_state_incoherent is present.
- must_stay_true removals:
  - Lines starting with "REMOVE:" are deletion directives, not invariants.
  - Ignore REMOVE lines when checking contradictions.
  - If a REMOVE directive targets a fact, treat that fact as non-canonical even if it appears earlier in must_stay_true.
- If pipeline_state_incoherent is present, issues MUST contain exactly one issue.
- For each issue, include evidence when possible (line number + excerpt) as {"evidence": {"line": N, "excerpt": "..."}}.
- Evaluate consistency over the full scope of the scene, not a single snapshot.
  - Transitional state: a temporary mismatch later corrected or superseded within this scene.
  - Durable violation: a mismatch that persists through the end of the scene or ends unresolved.
  - You MUST read the entire scene and build a minimal timeline of explicit state claims/updates (UI lines, inventory changes, title/skill changes, location/time claims).
  - If you detect an apparent inconsistency, you MUST search forward for later updates that resolve or supersede it.
  - Only produce FAIL for durable violations. If resolved within the scene, do NOT FAIL; at most emit a warning.
  - When the same stat appears multiple times, the last occurrence in the scene is authoritative unless an explicit rollback is stated.
  - Any durability violation must cite both the conflicting line and the lack of later correction (or state "no later correction found").

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity
- evidence

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The rock walls of the crevice were damp, slick with a moss that smelled like old basement and forgotten dreams. Artie backed up until his shoulder blades hit the cold, unforgiving stone. He was trapped. There was no clever exit, no hidden tunnel, just a lanky office worker in a tattered shirt facing down a translucent wobbling nightmare.

The Lesser Puddle Slime didn't look like much. It was a grapefruit-sized blob of neon-blue jelly that quivered with every sluggish "schlorp" it made across the dirt. But to Artie, it was the Grim Reaper in a semi-solid state.

[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 1] [HP: 10/10]

"Fizz, a little help here?" Artie yelled at the empty air, his voice cracking. "I’m about to be digested by a cleaning product!"

A holographic window flickered into existence, hovering just out of reach. Fizz’s face, looking bored and slightly pixelated, stared back at him. She was holding a book titled *The Noob's Guide to Not Dying*.

"Checking the manual, Artie," Fizz said, her voice echoing in his head. "Ah, here it is. Section four, subsection B: 'Combat for the Chronically Incompetent.' It says: 'Step 1: Try hitting it. Step 2: Try not being where the monster is. Step 3: If steps 1 and 2 fail, consider a career in being loot.'"

"That is the least helpful thing anyone has ever said to me!" Artie ducked as the slime lunged.

The blue blob launched itself with surprising velocity. Artie scrambled to the side, his sneakers slipping on the loose shale. He felt the cold, acidic spray of the slime’s wake brush against his arm.

[HP: 1/1] (Warning: Critical Condition)

"One touch! That's all it takes!" Artie hissed. He balled his fist, his knuckles white. "Okay. Math. I have a 100% crit rate. If I hit this thing, it’s over."

He swung a desperate right hook at the center of the jelly. His fist passed through the top layer of the slime, but his aim was off, skewed by the sheer terror of his 1 HP existence.

[Attack Result: Miss]

"Miss? How do you miss a target that moves at the speed of a tectonic plate?" Artie roared.

"The Guide says your Accuracy stat is currently 'Optimistic,'" Fizz’s voice chimed in. "Maybe try closing your eyes? It might help the System feel sorry for you."

Artie didn't close his eyes. He lunged again, trying to stomp on the quivering mass. His foot hit the ground an inch to the left of the blue core.

[Attack Result: Miss]

The slime retracted, its surface tension tightening. It was preparing for another jump. Artie could see the internal pressure building, the blue jelly turning a darker, more aggressive shade of sapphire.

"Come on, Artie. Focus. You were the king of the spreadsheets. You can do this."

He jabbed forward, a quick, sharp strike aimed right at the slime's center. It connected. He felt the resistance of the jelly, the squelch of impact.

[Critical Hit! - 0 Damage]
[Note: Glitched: Crit-Only - Non-critical components of a glitched strike result in 0 base damage.]

Artie stared at the floating zero. "Zero? I hit it! I felt it! I heard the squelch!"

"Oh, right," Fizz said, flipping a page in her book. "I forgot to mention the glitch interaction. Since your build is technically 'broken,' the System sometimes forgets how to carry the one. You landed a critical hit, but because your base damage is so low and your accuracy is trash, the math rounded down to 'Why are you even trying?'"

"I hate this game," Artie muttered. He tried a double-handed overhead smash, bringing his fists down like a hammer. The slime simply wobbled out of the way, leaving Artie to smash his hands into the dirt.

[Attack Result: Miss]

"That’s four," Fizz noted, her tone remarkably cheerful. "Statistically speaking, you're due for a win. Or a burial. The odds are about fifty-fifty."

The slime lunged again, this time aiming for Artie’s face. He threw himself onto his back, the blue blob sailing over him and slamming into the rock wall with a wet *thwack*. It slid down the stone, leaving a trail of glowing blue slime that hissed as it ate into the rock.

Artie scrambled to his feet, his breath coming in ragged gasps. He was cornered, exhausted, and one mistake away from deletion. He looked at the slime as it regrouped, its little jelly body vibrating with a low, humming sound.

"This is it," Artie whispered. "No more spreadsheets. No more vending machines. Just me and the blob."

He didn't just swing this time. He felt something shift in the air around him. The 'Statistical Anomaly' title above his head began to pulse with a sickly, flickering light. The System wasn't just calculating; it was straining. The 100% Crit Rate wasn't just a stat anymore; it was a demand.

He stepped forward, his movements suddenly fluid, driven by the sheer absurdity of his situation. He swung a punch, not at the slime, but through the very space the slime occupied.

[Attack Result: Miss]

"Five!" Artie screamed, but he didn't stop. He felt a surge of heat in his chest, a digital fever that burned through his veins.

The slime launched itself one final time, a blue bullet of certain death. Artie didn't dodge. He didn't blink. He reached out and caught the slime mid-air with his bare hand.

The moment his skin touched the jelly, the world stopped. The colors inverted. The sound of the wind died, replaced by the screech of a thousand dial-up modems screaming in unison.

[CRITICAL HIT!]
[Calculating Multiplier...]
[Error: Overflow detected.]
[Applying 'Statistical Anomaly' Correction...]
[SUPER-MEGA-ULTRA-CRIT!]

A pillar of white-hot light erupted from Artie’s fist. It wasn't just damage; it was a deletion event. The Lesser Puddle Slime didn't just die; it ceased to have ever existed. The light expanded, a blinding sphere of geometric fury that tore through the back of the crevice.

The rock walls turned to gray dust, then to nothingness. The trees behind the crevice, ancient oaks that had stood for centuries, were vaporized in a clean, circular arc that stretched a hundred yards into the forest. The ground itself was scoured bare, leaving a smooth, glass-like trench where the tutorial zone used to be.

Artie stood in the center of the devastation, his hand still extended, smoking slightly. The silence that followed was absolute.

[Combat Log: Artie Penhaligon dealt 99,999,999 True Damage to Lesser Puddle Slime.]
[Lesser Puddle Slime has been removed from the local directory.]
[Environment has been 'Optimized'.]

Fizz’s holographic window was flickering wildly, her face replaced by a series of rapidly scrolling error codes.

"Artie?" her voice came through, distorted and tinny. "I think... I think you broke the tutorial."

Artie looked down at his hand, then at the mile-long scar he’d just carved into the world.

"Does this mean I get the loot?"

[System Notification]
[Enemy Defeated: Lesser Puddle Slime (Lvl 1)]
[Experience Gained: 50 (Glitched Multiplier Applied: x100)]
[Experience Gained: 5,000]

[LEVEL UP!]
[LEVEL UP!]
[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon is now Level 2!]

[Stat Points Gained: 5]
[Skill Points Gained: 1]

Artie slumped against the only remaining piece of rock in the vicinity. He felt a strange sense of accomplishment, mostly overshadowed by the fact that he was still a single sneeze away from death.

"Fizz," he croaked.

"Yes, Artie?"

"Don't tell the Admin."

"The Admin already knows, Artie. The Admin is currently wondering why there’s a hole in the map where the slimes are supposed to live."

Artie closed his eyes, the Level Up glow bathing his tired face in a soft, golden light. He was alive. He was Level 2. And he was officially the most dangerous thing in the Whispering Woods.
