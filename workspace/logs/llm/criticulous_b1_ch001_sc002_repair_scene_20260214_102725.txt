PROSE:
The void didn't have a floor, which was Artie’s first grievance. It was just an infinite expanse of white static that smelled faintly of ozone and unwashed server racks. He drifted in the nothingness, his Corporate ID Badge dangling from its lanyard and tapping rhythmically against the severe electrical burns on his chest. Every tap was a reminder that he’d been killed by a snack machine.

"Listen, User 404-Penhaligon, we really need to focus," a voice buzzed. It sounded like a hummingbird with a megaphone.

Artie looked up. Fizz was a tiny, glowing blue sprite with spiky neon blue hair that seemed to vibrate with every syllable. She was currently hovering three inches from his nose, her white eyes narrowed in what Artie assumed was the digital equivalent of a headache.

"I’m focusing," Artie said, his voice echoing in the empty space. "I’m looking at the shiny buttons. I like buttons. Usually, they give me chips. This time, they just give me... what is 'Vigor' again?"

[System Notification: Character Creation Phase 2/3]
[Available Points: 10]
[Bonus Anomaly Pool: 50] (Warning: Unstable Source Detected)

"Vigor is survival, Arthur," Fizz said, her wings trailing pixelated dust. "It increases your HP. You know, the stuff that keeps you from being a ghost? Which, technically, you already are, but we're trying to fix that. Most players put at least five points into Vigor. It’s the ‘don't die in one hit’ tax."

Artie ignored her, his hazel eyes fixed on the Bonus Anomaly Pool. Fifty points. That was a lot of points. He felt the faint keyboard callus on his right palm itch—a phantom sensation from a life spent clicking through spreadsheets. He was a man of optimization. He was a man who knew that in a world of variables, 100% was the only number that mattered.

"And what’s this one?" Artie pointed at a stat near the bottom of the list. "Critical Hit Rate."

Fizz’s glow dimmed to a worried shade of indigo. "That? That’s for rogues and gamblers. It’s capped at 25% for Level 1 characters. The System doesn't like certainties, Arthur. It likes math. It likes the struggle."

"I’ve had enough struggle," Artie muttered. He reached out and tapped the 'plus' icon next to Critical Hit Rate. 

[Warning: Stat Allocation exceeds Level 1 soft-cap. Proceed?]

He tapped it again. And again. He dumped all ten of his standard points into the stat. Then, with a grin that felt far too wide for a dead man, he dragged the entire fifty-point Bonus Anomaly Pool into the same slot.

"Wait! No!" Fizz shrieked, diving toward the floating screen. "You can't just—that pool is from a reality-glitch death! It’s not balanced! You’re going to—"

[System Error: Statistical Anomaly Detected]
[Recalculating...]
[Critical Hit Rate: 100%]
[Condition Triggered: Glass Soul]
[Penalty: HP locked at minimum value.]

Artie felt a sudden, sharp chill. It wasn't the cold of the void; it was the sensation of his very essence being stretched thin, like a single sheet of gold foil. He looked down at his hands. They were pale, almost translucent.

[System Notification: Build Finalized]
[HP: 1/1]
[Crit Rate: 100%]

"One?" Artie blinked. "I have one hit point?"

"You have one hit point," Fizz deadpanned, her blue hair sagging. "A stiff breeze will kill you. A particularly aggressive sneeze from a goblin will delete your save file. You are a glass cannon without the cannon part. You’re just... glass."

"But I have 100% Crit," Artie countered, his confidence returning as he processed the math. "That means every time I hit something, I hit it where it hurts. Every time. No RNG. No luck. Just... results."

"You’re an idiot," Fizz whispered.

[Title Unlocked: Crit or Quit]
[Effect: All damage dealt is guaranteed to be a Critical Hit. All damage received is guaranteed to be fatal.]

"See? The System even gave me a title," Artie said, patting the pocket of his trousers where his Smartphone and Leather Wallet were still stowed. "It’s practically an endorsement."

"It’s a warning label," Fizz snapped. "And now, because you’ve broken the tutorial before it even started, we’re being fast-tracked. The System doesn't want you in the void anymore. It wants you somewhere you can be 'balanced' by a monster."

The white static around them began to ripple and tear. The smell of ozone was replaced by the scent of damp grass and something vaguely sweet. The void was dissolving, replaced by rolling green hills and a sky that was a bit too blue to be natural.

"Welcome to the Slime Fields, Arthur," Fizz said, her wings buzzing with a frantic energy as she began to fade into her invisible 'Guide' mode. "Try not to trip on a pebble. I'm pretty sure that would count as crushing damage."

Artie stood on the new grass, his Corporate ID Badge swinging. He felt light. Terribly, dangerously light. 

"One HP," he whispered to himself, looking at a translucent green blob wobbling in the distance. "Well. Better not miss."
