PROSE:
The vibration didn't start in the air; it began in the marrow of Lyra’s teeth. It was a rhythmic, low-frequency thrum that set the silver vials in her bandolier rattling against her chest. She pressed her palm flat against the damp earth of the Whispering Woods, feeling the moss shudder. This wasn't the tectonic shift of a tremor, nor the heavy footfalls of a forest drake. It was something deliberate. Something old.

Across the valley, the bells of Oakhaven continued their frantic, rhythmic mourning, signaling the lockdown. Lyra ignored them. The citadel’s problems rarely reached the forest floor, but the energy surging through the ley-lines beneath her boots was a more immediate concern. 

"Steady," she whispered to herself, her voice a dry rasp. She adjusted the strap of her recurve bow, her fingers tracing the notched wood. 

The air itself seemed to hum with an ancient, resonant cold, a quality not of temperature but of time, thick with the dust of epochs. Stone, scarred by winds that had scoured centuries, loomed ahead—the jagged remains of the Aethelgard Watch. Normally, the ruins were dead, nothing more than a graveyard for forgotten kings and the occasional nest of shadow-wasps. But tonight, the stones were bleeding light. A pale, cyanotic glow leaked from the cracks in the masonry, pulsing in time with the thrum in her teeth.

Lyra’s survival instincts, honed by three years of scavenging the borderlands, screamed at her to retreat. The Whispering Woods were treacherous enough in the dark without the added variable of a magical flare-up. Prudence dictated a five-mile detour toward the southern marshes. But her pragmatism—the part of her that remembered the empty grain-bins in her cellar and the dwindling charge in her hearth-stones—held her steady. An energy surge of this magnitude usually meant a breach, and a breach meant artifacts.

She crept forward, her boots making no sound on the decaying leaf litter. As she crested a small rise, she saw the source. The ruins weren't just glowing; they were breathing. A ripple of distortion, like heat haze on a summer road, shimmered around the central archway. 

The fluctuations were erratic. One moment, the ambient mana was a stagnant pool; the next, it was a rushing torrent that made the hair on her arms stand on end. She pulled a brass lens from her pocket—a rusted surveyor’s tool she’d modified with a sliver of refined quartz. Looking through it, the world turned a bruised purple, revealing the jagged lines of force. They weren't dissipating. They were being pulled.

Something—or someone—was acting as a vacuum for the local resonance.

"Too much noise for a simple relic," she muttered, her eyes narrowing. 

If the High Guard’s hounds were already out in response to the bells, they’d see this beacon from miles away. If she was going to scavenge anything, she had a window of minutes, not hours. She checked her dagger, ensuring the hilt was clear of her cloak. 

The conflict gnawed at her. To enter the Aethelgard ruins during a surge was to risk being unmade by the very air, or worse, trapped in a temporal pocket. Yet, the specific frequency of the vibration—that rhythmic, silver-sharp beat—tugged at a memory she couldn't quite place. It felt like a call. It felt like an invitation written in a language her blood understood even if her mind did not.

A sudden, sharp crack echoed through the trees—not the sound of a branch breaking, but the crystalline snap of a magical ward failing. The glow in the ruins intensified, turning from a soft cyan to a blinding, violent white. 

Lyra shielded her eyes, her heart hammering against her ribs. The pragmatist in her lost the argument. If she stayed on the periphery, she was just a witness to her own poverty. If she moved, she was a player. 

She stood, shaking the tension from her legs. She didn't head for the safety of the deep woods. Instead, she adjusted her pack, checked the tension on her bowstring one last time, and began a low, crouched run toward the shimmering maw of the ruins. The cold intensified as she drew closer, the scent of ozone and ancient stone filling her lungs. Whatever was waking up in the heart of the Aethelgard, she would be the first to claim it.
