It wasn't just sitting there; it was mocking him. The bag was suspended by a literal quarter-turn of a rusted metal coil, dangling over the precipice of the delivery chute like a cinematic hero holding onto a ledge by his fingernails. Except in this movie, the hero was a nitrogen-flushed bag of corn-based snacks, and the villain was a forty-year-old office worker who just wanted his damn lunch.\n\n\"Are you kidding me?\" Artie muttered, his breath fogging the plastic. \"I paid for the 'Zesty.' I paid for the 'Habanero.' I even paid for the 'Hoops.' Where are my Hoops, Dave?\"\n\nThe machine didn't answer. It just hummed with the low-frequency vibration of a device that hadn't been serviced since the Clinton administration. The digital display, a flickering green relic of a bygone era, simply blinked: **CREDIT: $0.00**.\n\nThat was the lie. Artie had inserted a dollar. A crisp, relatively un-crumpled George Washington. He had watched the machine inhale it, hesitate, and then decide that it wasn't a dollar at all, but rather a gift. A tribute. A sacrifice to the gods of processed sodium.\n\n\"We aren't doing this today,\" Artie said, his voice rising to a pitch that usually signaled a pending HR meeting. \"I have had three cups of lukewarm coffee, two spreadsheets that refuse to balance, and a boss who unironically uses the phrase 'synergistic paradigm shift.' I will have my Hoops.\"\n\nHe checked the breakroom. Empty. The fluorescent lights overhead hummed in sympathy with the machine, flickering with a rhythmic instability that suggested the building\u2019s wiring was held together by hope and electrical tape. Artie leaned his shoulder against the side of the Snack-O-Matic.\n\nIn the world of corporate survival, Artie knew there were two types of people: those who saw a 'Stuck' sign and walked away, and those who recognized that the System was rigged and decided to break the System back. He was the latter. This wasn't about the ninety-nine cents plus tax. This was about the principle of the thing. This was about the RNG of life finally going his way for once.\n\nHe gave the machine a firm, measured shove.\n\nThe Hoops didn't budge. If anything, the vibration of the impact seemed to settle them more firmly onto the coil.\n\n\"Oh, so it's a boss fight then?\" Artie adjusted his glasses. \"Fine. Phase two.\"\n\nHe grabbed the edges of the machine, his fingers finding purchase in the grime-coated vents on the side. He began to rock it. It was a delicate art\u2014too much force and the whole thing would tip over and crush him, which would be an embarrassing way to go, even by his standards. Too little, and the Hoops would remain in their plastic purgatory.\n\n*Clunk. Whirr.*\n\nThe machine groaned. Inside, the coil shifted a fraction of a millimeter. The bag of Hoops swayed. \n\n\"Yes,\" Artie hissed. \"Gravity. The only law that actually works in this building. Come to papa.\"\n\nHe gave it one more violent heave, putting his entire weight into the momentum. He felt a sudden, sharp resistance, followed by a sound like a synthesizer dying in a bathtub. \n\nThe lights in the breakroom didn't just flicker; they surged. The hum of the Snack-O-Matic jumped an octave, then two, turning into a screeching whine that vibrated in Artie's teeth. A smell of ozone and burnt hair filled the air\u2014the universal scent of a terrible mistake.\n\n\"Uh oh,\" Artie said. \n\nHe tried to let go, but his hands were locked. A blue-white arc of electricity jumped from the 'Coin Return' slot directly into his palm. It wasn't like a static shock. It was like being hit by a freight train made of pure, unadulterated math. \n\nHis vision didn't go black. It went white. A searing, clinical, high-definition white that made his retinas scream. \n\nThe sound of the office\u2014the distant clicking of keyboards, the muffled roar of the HVAC, the squeak of Brenda\u2019s ergonomic chair\u2014vanished. It was replaced by a single, resonant tone.\n\n[SYSTEM NOTIFICATION: CRITICAL ERROR - SYSTEM OVERLOAD]\n\nThe words didn't appear in front of him; they appeared *inside* his head, rendered in a font that looked suspiciously like the one used by the very vending machine that was currently liquefying his nervous system.\n\n[USER: PENHALIGON, ARTHUR - STATUS: TERMINATED]\n\n\"Terminated?\" Artie tried to shout, but he didn't have lungs anymore. He didn't have a throat. He was just a collection of thoughts floating in a sea of bleach. \"I'm not fired! I'm... oh. Oh, that kind of terminated.\"\n\n[RECALCULATING...]\n[RNG THRESHOLD EXCEEDED]\n[INITIATING EMERGENCY PROTOCOL: 'THE GREAT LOGIN SCREEN IN THE SKY']\n\nThe white void rippled. As the reality of the breakroom dissolved, Artie felt his corporate attire unravel. His poly-blend shirt coarsened, the fibers thickening into a rough, cream-colored Linen Tunic. The weight of his wallet vanished, replaced by the distinct, heavy clink of a Single Copper Coin settling into a new pocket.\n\nMost jarringly, his right hand\u2014the one that had been fused to the Snack-O-Matic\u2014clenched around a hilt. It was cold, heavy, and metallic. As the light stabilized, he looked down to see a Broken Tutorial Sword gripped in his hand.\n\nThe last thing Artie thought before the transition finalized was a singular, burning regret. \n\n*I never got my Hoops.*\n\nThen, the world shifted.

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nMechanics contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and labels (stats/skills) must be sourced from state or explicitly updated in the state_patch. Do not invent numbers or canonical tokens.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the RNG-Hellscape\",\"goal\":\"Introduce Artie and his

It wasn't just sitting there; it was mocking me. It was suspended by a literal quarter-turn of a rusted metal coil, dangling over the precipice of the delivery chute like a cinematic hero holding onto a ledge by his fingernails. Except in this movie, the hero was a nitrogen-flushed bag of corn-based snacks, and the villain was a forty-year-old office worker named Arthur Penhaligon who just wanted his damn lunch.\n\n\"Are you kidding me?\" I muttered, my breath fogging the plastic. \"I paid for the 'Zesty.' I paid for the 'Habanero.' I even paid for the 'Hoops.' Where are my Hoops, Dave?\"\n\nThe machine didn't answer. It just hummed with the low-frequency vibration of a device that hadn't been serviced since the Clinton administration. The digital display, a flickering green relic of a bygone era, simply blinked: **CREDIT: $0.00**.\n\nThat was the lie. I had inserted a dollar. A crisp, relatively un-crumpled George Washington. I had watched the machine inhale it, hesitate, and then decide that it wasn't a dollar at all, but rather a gift. A tribute. A sacrifice to the gods of processed sodium.\n\n\"We aren't doing this today,\" I said, my voice rising to a pitch that usually signaled a pending HR meeting. \"I have had three cups of lukewarm coffee, two spreadsheets that refuse to balance, and a boss who unironically uses the phrase 'synergistic paradigm shift.' I will have my Hoops.\"\n\nI checked the breakroom. Empty. The fluorescent lights overhead hummed in sympathy with the machine, flickering with a rhythmic instability that suggested the building\u2019s wiring was held together by hope and electrical tape. I leaned my shoulder against the side of the Snack-O-Matic.\n\nIn the world of corporate survival, there are two types of people: those who see a 'Stuck' sign and walk away, and those who recognize that the System is rigged and decide to break the System back. I was the latter. This wasn't about the ninety-nine cents plus tax. This was about the principle of the thing. This was about the RNG of life finally going my way for once.\n\nI gave the machine a firm, measured shove.\n\nThe Hoops didn't budge. If anything, the vibration of the impact seemed to settle them more firmly onto the coil.\n\n\"Oh, so it's a boss fight then?\" I adjusted my glasses. \"Fine. Phase two.\"\n\nI grabbed the edges of the machine, my fingers finding purchase in the grime-coated vents on the side. I began to rock it. It was a delicate art\u2014too much force and the whole thing would tip over and crush me, which would be an embarrassing way to go, even by my standards. Too little, and the Hoops would remain in their plastic purgatory.\n\n*Clunk. Whirr.*\n\nThe machine groaned. Inside, the coil shifted a fraction of a millimeter. The bag of Hoops swayed. \n\n\"Yes,\" I hissed. \"Gravity. The only law that actually works in this building. Come to papa.\"\n\nI gave it one more violent heave, putting my entire weight into the momentum. I felt a sudden, sharp resistance, followed by a sound like a synthesizer dying in a bathtub. \n\nThe lights in the breakroom didn't just flicker; they surged. The hum of the Snack-O-Matic jumped an octave, then two, turning into a screeching whine that vibrated in my teeth. A smell of ozone and burnt hair filled the air\u2014the universal scent of 'You\u2019ve Made a Terrible Mistake.'\n\n\"Uh oh,\" I said. \n\nI tried to let go, but my hands were locked. A blue-white arc of electricity jumped from the 'Coin Return' slot directly into my palm. It wasn't like a static shock. It was like being hit by a freight train made of pure, unadulterated math. \n\nMy vision didn't go black. It went white. A searing, clinical, high-definition white that made my retinas scream. \n\nThe sound of the office\u2014the distant clicking of keyboards, the muffled roar of the HVAC, the squeak of Brenda\u2019s ergonomic chair\u2014vanished. It was replaced by a single, resonant tone.\n\n[CRITICAL ERROR: SYSTEM OVERLOAD]\n\nThe words didn't appear in front of me; they appeared *inside* my head, rendered in a font that looked suspiciously like the one used by the very vending machine that was currently liquefying my nervous system.\n\n[User: PENHALIGON, ARTHUR - STATUS: TERMINATED]\n\n\"Terminated?\" I tried to shout, but I didn't have lungs anymore. I didn't have a throat. I was just a collection of thoughts floating in a sea of bleach. \"I'm not fired! I'm... oh. Oh, that kind of terminated.\"\n\n[RECALCULATING...]\n[RNG THRESHOLD EXCEEDED]\n[INITIATING EMERGENCY PROTOCOL: 'THE GREAT LOGIN SCREEN IN THE SKY']\n\nThe white void rippled. For a second, I felt a weight in my right hand\u2014something cold, heavy, and metallic. I felt the scratchy pull of a fabric that definitely wasn't my poly-blend office shirt. \n\nThe last thing I thought before the transition finalized was a singular, burning regret. \n\n*I never got my Hoops.*\n\nThen, the world shifted. The white void stabilized, and for the first time in my life, I saw a UI that looked like it was designed by someone who actually enjoyed making people suffer.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"characters\": {\n    \"count\": 5,\n    \"status\": \"READY\",\n    \"updated_at\": \"2026-02-06T21:45:27Z\"\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 1\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_001/scene_001.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"PLANNED\",\n  \"summary\": {\n    \"chapter_so_far\": [],\n    \"key_facts_ring\": [],\n    \"last_scene\": [],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [],\n    \"pending_story_rollups\": [],\n    \"story_so_far\": []\n  },\n  \"world\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [],\n    \"location\": \"\",\n    \"open_threads\": [],\n    \"recent_facts\": [],\n    \"time\": {}\n  }\n}\n"
