PROSE:
One hundred points. It was a nice, round number. A number that suggested competence, or at least a fair shake at a second chance. 

Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon hovered in the neon-blue hum of the Character Creation Suite, staring at the translucent windows that flickered with every beat of his non-existent heart. The UI was a chaotic sprawl of sliders and checkboxes, looking less like a divine interface and more like a spreadsheet that had survived a catastrophic crash.

"Can we speed this up? I have a three-o'clock with a guy who died trying to parkour off a moving train, and honestly, his stats are already looking more promising than yours," Fizz said, her pixelated wings buzzing near Artie’s ear. She adjusted her miniature uniform, her expression one of practiced, professional impatience.

Artie didn't look at her. He was too focused on the [Attribute Points: 100] blinking in the corner of his vision. Below it, his current stats were a depressing row of base tens, with one glaring exception.

[STATS]
- [Strength: 10]
- [Agility: 10]
- [Intelligence: 10]
- [Constitution: 10]
- [Luck: 1]
- [Critical Hit Rate: 0.01%]

"Constitution," Artie muttered, his translucent hand trembling. "I need Constitution. I’ve had enough of the 'Deceased' status for one lifetime. I want to be a tank. A glorious, unkillable slab of meat."

"A noble goal for someone who just got taken out by a bag of Cool Ranch chips," Fizz remarked, inspecting her fingernails. "But the Void has a bit of latency. Or maybe it’s just your soul’s lingering trauma from the short circuit. Either way, move faster. I’m losing my 'Patient Guide' buff and it’s about to be replaced by 'Sarcastic Bystander.'"

Artie reached out, aiming his finger at the Constitution slider. He intended to dump at least fifty points into it, enough to ensure that a stiff breeze wouldn't send him back to the respawn screen. But as his finger neared the glass-like interface, a sudden, violent spasm racked his ghostly frame—a final, dying echo of the several thousand volts that had recently reorganized his nervous system.

His hand jerked. His finger didn't hit Constitution. It slammed into the 'Critical Hit Rate' slider and dragged it with the force of a desperate man.

[Critical Hit Rate: 100%]
[Remaining Attribute Points: 0]

The UI emitted a sound like a jackpot hitting on a rigged slot machine.

"Uh," Artie said, his heart—or the place where it used to be—sinking. "Is that... supposed to happen?"

Fizz flew closer, her eyes widening as she scanned the display. "Did you just... you did. You put every single point into Crit. You didn't even touch Agility. Or Strength. Or, you know, the stat that keeps your lungs inflated."

"I can fix it," Artie said, his voice rising in panic. He reached for the 'Reset' button, but the latency chose that exact moment to vanish. The UI snapped forward, and his frantic poking landed squarely on the 'Confirm Build' prompt.

[System Notification: Build Confirmed!]
[Recalculating physical integrity based on selected attributes...]
[Warning: Constitution remains at base level (10) with severe 'Deceased' penalty applied.]
[Warning: HP has been capped to minimum viable threshold.]

"No, no! Undo! Where is the escape key?" Artie shouted, clawing at the air.

"There is no escape key in the afterlife, Penhaligon," Fizz sighed, her voice dripping with a mix of pity and dark amusement. "You just locked in a build with the durability of a wet paper towel and the offensive potential of a supernova. You’re essentially a glass cannon, except the glass is already cracked."

A new window erupted in front of Artie’s face, glowing with an ominous, golden light.

[System Notification: Title Acquired!]
[Title: Crit or Quit (ID: TITLE_CRIT_OR_QUIT)]
[Description: You have achieved the impossible—a 100% Critical Hit rate at Level 1. You will either vaporize your enemies or be sneezed into oblivion. There is no middle ground.]
[Effect: All successful hits are guaranteed Critical Hits. HP is permanently locked at 1. Any damage taken is fatal.]

Artie stared at the final tally.

[HP: 1/1]
[Crit Rate: 100%]

"One?" Artie whispered. "I have one hit point? I’ve had paper cuts more threatening than my entire life force."

"On the bright side," Fizz said, patting him on the shoulder—which felt like a sharp static shock—"you’ll never have to worry about long-term healthcare. If anything touches you, you're just... gone. It’s very efficient, really."

The blue light of the suite began to fragment. The neon lines of the void dissolved, replaced by the rough, dark textures of ancient bark and the smell of damp earth.

"Wait, I'm not ready! Give me a re-spec! I'll give you a five-star review!"

"Review all you want," Fizz said, her form becoming solid as she pulled the Standard Guide's Manual from her satchel. "But you’re live, Artie. Welcome to the Whispering Woods. Try not to trip on a pebble. It would be a very embarrassing way to end this."

[System Notification: Deployment Commencing...]
[Location: Tutorial Zone - Whispering Woods]
[Good luck, Anomaly. You're going to need it.]

Artie felt the sudden, jarring weight of gravity. His feet hit solid dirt. He wobbled, his heart hammering against his ribs—a single, fragile beat that represented his entire existence. He looked at the floating red '1' in the corner of his vision.

"One HP," he muttered. "I'm a walking game-over screen."

"And a walking miracle," Fizz added, hovering just above his head. "Now, look alive. We’ve got company."

A low growl echoed from the thicket ahead. Artie’s 100% Crit Rate glowed in his peripheral vision, a golden promise of power that felt exactly like a death sentence.
