PROSE:

The soles of Artie’s sneakers hammered against the packed dirt of the North Road, each impact vibrating straight up his shins and threatening to shatter his precarious 1 HP existence. Behind him, the low-poly snarls of a pack of Mangy Coyotes faded into the distance, but the air around him still hummed with the sickly, neon-green throb of the Aggro Aura.

In his left hand, the Participation Trophy (Tutorial Edition) pulsed like a radioactive heart. In his right, the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) felt less like a weapon and more like a lightning rod for bad luck.

"Almost... there..." Artie wheezed. His stamina bar was a flickering sliver of yellow, hovering dangerously close to the 'Exhausted' debuff.

"Pick up the pace, Artie! You’re running like a man who hasn't seen a gym since the Clinton administration," Fizz chirped, hovering effortlessly beside his head. She was upside down, lazily spinning in the air while checking a translucent scroll. "Also, you’re trailing a very angry Level 5 Coyote. It’s about thirty meters back and looks like it hasn't had breakfast. Or a bath. Ever."

"I’m... doing... my... best!" Artie managed to choke out. 

The gates of Oakhaven finally loomed ahead—massive, iron-banded timber walls that promised the sweet, sweet safety of a non-combat zone. Two guards stood under the shadow of the archway, leaning on halberds with the practiced apathy of men who had seen too many level-one idiots die in the dirt.

As Artie stumbled into the 'Scanner Range' marked by a faint blue line on the road, he heard the guards talking. They weren't reaching for their weapons. They were reaching for small, leather-bound ledgers.

"Told you," the guard on the left said, squinting through a visor. He had a nameplate that read [Guard Hovis - Lvl 15]. "Look at the gait. That’s a sub-five Agility if I ever saw one. Five silver says he trips before the line."

The second guard, [Guard Barnaby - Lvl 14], snorted. "No way. Look at the panic. That’s a 'Fear' buff if I’ve ever seen it. Fear gives a hidden +2 to sprint speed. I’ll take that bet, and I’ll raise you another five that his Vitality is so low he’s practically a ghost already."

"Hey!" Artie yelled, his voice cracking. "A little help? Monster? Behind me?"

Hovis didn't even look up from his ledger. "Processing is at the gate, kid. Stay in the lane. If you die before the scanner hits you, the bet’s a wash, Barnaby."

Artie reached the blue line, his heart hammering against his ribs—a sensation that, in this world, felt like a literal countdown to a Game Over.

[System Notification: Entering Oakhaven Scanning Perimeter. Please remain still for Stat Validation.]

"Still?" Artie screamed, glancing over his shoulder. The Mangy Coyote was visible now, a blur of grey fur and yellow teeth, kicking up a cloud of dust as it accelerated. The Aggro Aura on the trophy in Artie's left hand flared bright green, practically screaming *Eat Me* to the local wildlife. "I can't remain still! There is a literal apex predator trying to turn me into a statistic!"

"Statistically speaking," Fizz said, popping a piece of spectral bubblegum, "you already are one."

A shimmering curtain of light descended from the archway. It was a pale, clinical blue that smelled faintly of ozone and old library books. As Artie crossed the threshold, the light hit him, and for a second, time seemed to stutter.

The scanner didn't just beep. It groaned.

[Scanning...]
[Name: Arthur Penhaligon]
[Level: 2]
[HP: 1/1]
[Critical Hit Rate: 100%]

The blue light turned a violent, strobe-light red. A siren, high-pitched and dissonant like a dial-up modem screaming in agony, erupted from the gatehouse.

[WARNING: STATISTICAL ANOMALY DETECTED]
[DATA CORRUPTION SUSPECTED: VALUE 'HP' OUTSIDE STANDARD DEVIATION]
[DATA CORRUPTION SUSPECTED: VALUE 'CRIT_RATE' EXCEEDS SYSTEM CAPS]

Hovis and Barnaby both jumped, their ledgers flying into the dirt. 

"What the hell?" Barnaby shouted, shielding his eyes. "Is the machine breaking? I’ve never heard the 'Anomaly' siren before. Not since that guy tried to smuggle a Bag of Holding inside another Bag of Holding."

"Look at the readout!" Hovis pointed to a floating display above the gate. 

The display was flickering, trying to render Artie's stats for the public record, but the numbers were spinning so fast they looked like a blur of static. Then, the text settled into a jagged, pixelated font:

[SUBJECT: ARTIE]
[THREAT LEVEL: UNKNOWN / PATHETIC]
[STATUS: 1 HP / 100% CRIT]
[SYSTEM NOTE: How are you even alive?]

"One HP?" Hovis whispered, his jaw dropping. "Barnaby, you owe me ten silver. That’s not just low Vitality, that’s... that’s a rounding error."

"Forget the silver!" Barnaby yelled, pointing past Artie. "Look at what he brought with him!"

The Level 5 Mangy Coyote hit the scanning perimeter at full tilt. Normally, a wild animal would avoid the scent of civilization, but the Participation Trophy’s aura was an irresistible siren song of pure, concentrated hatred. The coyote didn't even slow down; it lunged, its eyes fixed on the glowing trophy in Artie's left hand.

"Panic!" Artie yelled, which was less of a tactical command and more of a lifestyle choice. He swung his right hand wildly, the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) whistling through the air.

He didn't hit the coyote. He hit the air *near* the coyote. 

[Critical Hit! - 0 Damage (Prop Weapon Penalty)]
[System Note: You successfully critted the atmosphere. The air molecules are very upset.]

The shockwave of the 'Air-Crit' didn't hurt the monster, but the sheer mathematical impossibility of the hit caused a localized vacuum. The coyote’s lunge was jerked six inches to the left, its teeth snapping shut on empty air just centimeters from Artie's throat.

"Help! Guards! Do your jobs!" Artie scrambled backward, tripping over his own feet and falling flat on his ass.

[HP: 1/1]
[System Notification: Falling damage negated due to 'Pathetic Grace' hidden modifier. You are too light to impact the ground with force.]

"The kid's a virus!" Barnaby shouted, finally drawing a heavy iron mace. "Hovis, help me clear the aggro before the scanner explodes!"

Hovis leveled his halberd and stepped forward with a sigh. "This is going to be so much paperwork. I hate anomalies."

With a practiced thrust, Hovis drove the halberd into the coyote’s flank. The beast yelped, its focus finally breaking from the trophy as the guard’s superior level and stats took over. Barnaby followed up with a crushing blow from his mace, turning the Level 5 threat into a heap of dissolving pixels in seconds.

[Combat Ended]
[Experience Shared: 0 (Subject did not contribute meaningful damage)]
[System Note: Flailing is not a combat style.]

Artie sat in the dirt, clutching the trophy to his chest, his breath coming in ragged gasps. The red strobe light of the scanner was still pulsing, casting long, rhythmic shadows against the gate.

"You," Hovis said, walking over and looming over Artie. He poked Artie’s shoulder with the blunt end of his halberd. "Don't move. I need to see if you’re going to pop."

"I'm not going to pop," Artie snapped, though he wasn't entirely sure. "I'm just... efficient. I put all my points into the good stuff."

"Kid, you put all your points into a death wish," Barnaby said, shaking his head as he picked up his ledger. "One HP? A sneeze would send you back to the respawn shrine. And we don't even have a respawn shrine in Oakhaven. It's under renovation."

"Wait, what?" Artie looked up, his face paling. "No respawn? Then where do people go when they die?"

"Usually into a very small box," Fizz said, appearing on Artie's shoulder and patting his cheek. "But don't worry! I'm sure your '100% Crit' rate will protect you from the crushing reality of permanent deletion. Probably."

The siren finally died down, replaced by a low, rhythmic thumping sound from the gatehouse. A small slot opened in the stone wall, and a wooden token clattered out, landing in the dirt next to Artie. 

The token was bright orange and had a large, black 'A' stamped on it.

"Pick it up," Hovis commanded.

Artie reached out and grabbed the token.

[Item Acquired: Anomaly ID Tag]
[Type: Quest Item / Mark of Shame]
[Description: You are officially a Statistical Anomaly. This tag alerts all town NPCs that your existence is a bug in the System. Expect higher prices, deeper suspicion, and frequent 'Safety Checks' from local authorities.]

"Great," Artie muttered, pushing himself to his feet. He dusted off his jeans, though the 'Participation Trophy' in his left hand continued to hum with a faint, lingering green light. "Is there a 'I’m Just a Victim of Circumstance' tag I can trade this for?"

"Move it along, Anomaly," Barnaby said, gesturing toward the town square beyond the gate. "The Mayor's going to want to hear about you. We haven't had a 1 HP build since 'The Great Math Collapse' of '04, and that guy died because he sat on a particularly sharp piece of cheese."

"I'll be careful with the dairy," Artie said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. 

He started walking, his legs still shaking. As he passed through the archway, he felt the heavy gaze of the guards on his back. They weren't betting on his stats anymore; they were watching him like a bomb that might go off at any second.

"So," Fizz said, zipping ahead of him into the bustling streets of Oakhaven. "First stop: the tavern? Or should we go straight to the blacksmith and see if he can turn that 'Prop' sword into something that actually kills things instead of just offending the laws of physics?"

Artie looked down at the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) in his right hand. The blade was chipped, the hilt was loose, and it was currently his only hope of survival in a world where a stiff breeze was a boss fight.

"Tavern," Artie said firmly. "I need a drink. And I need to find a way to get rid of this trophy before it attracts a dragon or a very aggressive squirrel."

"Good luck with that," Fizz laughed. "Cursed items are like bad reputations—they’re really hard to scrub off."

Artie stepped into Oakhaven, the 'Anomaly' tag swinging from his belt, a Level 2 glitch in a world governed by hard numbers.
