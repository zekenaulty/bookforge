PROSE:

The transition from the server-room-scented void to the Tutorial Zone felt less like a magical teleportation and more like being shoved through a high-definition meat grinder. One moment, I was arguing with a flickering blue sprite about my questionable life choices; the next, the floor vanished, replaced by the aggressive scent of pine needles and damp earth.

I hit the ground with a grunt that sounded remarkably like a spreadsheet being deleted. The impact wasn't hard—the grass was unnaturally lush, like it had been rendered with a high-end shader—but it was enough to make the blue plastic of my Corporate ID Badge slap against my collarbone. I lay there for a second, staring up at a sky so blue it looked like a default desktop wallpaper.

"Welcome to the great outdoors, Artie!" Fizz’s voice chirped from somewhere above my left ear. "Try not to breathe too much. The oxygen here is surprisingly addictive."

I rolled onto my side, my hand brushing against the rough bark of a nearby tree. The vending machine scar on my right knuckle throbbed—a jagged reminder of the Snack-Master 4000 and the electrical surge that had sent me here. I reached into my pocket, feeling the jagged, spiderwebbed glass of my Cracked Smartphone. It was dead weight now, a relic of a world where 'critical hit' usually referred to a server crash, not my own mortality.

I pushed myself up to a sitting position, and that’s when I saw it.

[System Notification: Welcome to the Tutorial Zone (Lush Forest)!]
[Quest Initiated: Survive the Spawn]
[Objective: Reach the Oakhaven Gates (0/1)]

"Survive," I muttered, the word tasting like copper. "That’s a bit ominous for a tutorial, isn't it?"

"Only if you're bad at games," Fizz said, hovering into my line of sight. She looked even more pixelated against the vibrant green of the forest, her neon blue hair flickering like a dying fluorescent bulb. "And considering you just dumped every single point into a stat that requires you to actually *hit* things before they hit you... well, 'ominous' is a polite way of putting it."

I ignored her and did what any self-respecting Junior Analyst would do: I checked the data.

[Character: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[Title: Statistical Anomaly]
[Level: 1]
[HP: 1/1]
[Crit Rate: 100%]

The '1/1' was pulsing. Not a friendly, 'hey look at me' pulse, but a rhythmic, warning-red throb that made my stomach do a slow roll. One. One single point of health. In my previous life, I’d survived a flu that felt like more than one point of damage. I’d survived a three-hour meeting with the Regional Director without a coffee break. But here, in this hyper-saturated forest, I was a single papercut away from deletion.

"Fizz," I said, my voice rising an octave. "Why is my health bar the size of a postage stamp?"

"Because you wanted to be a 'specialist,' remember?" She did a mid-air somersault, leaving a pixelated trail in her wake. "You’re the ultimate glass cannon, Artie! Except, you know, without the cannon part yet. Right now, you’re more like a glass... marble. Very shiny, very fragile, and likely to be stepped on."

A rustling sound came from the bushes to my right. It wasn't the gentle sound of the wind. It was rhythmic. Wet.

*Schlorp. Schlorp. Schlorp.*

I froze. My heart hammered against my ribs, each beat feeling like it might be the thing that finally shattered my 1 HP limit. Slowly, I turned my head.

Emerging from the undergrowth was a creature that looked like a giant, lime-flavored Jell-O mold that had developed a grudge against the world. It was translucent, wobbling with every movement, and its surface was flecked with bits of undigested leaves and what looked suspiciously like a very small, very dead squirrel.

[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 1]
[HP: 15/15]

The slime didn't have eyes, but I could feel its intent. It was hungry, and I was the only thing on the menu that wasn't made of wood.

"Oh, look!" Fizz whispered, her voice dripping with mock-excitement. "Your first encounter! Usually, players use this to practice their basic attacks. You, however, might want to practice your 'running away while screaming' technique."

The slime contracted, its gelatinous body pulling inward like a rubber band being stretched to its limit. 

"Is it... is it supposed to do that?" I asked, scrambling backward. My heels dug into the soft loam, and I felt the Corporate ID Badge catch on a twig. I ripped it free, the lanyard snapping taut around my neck.

"That’s the 'Leap' animation, Artie," Fizz said, checking her nonexistent fingernails. "In about two seconds, it’s going to launch itself at your face. Given its velocity and your current lack of armor, I’d say the impact will deal approximately... oh, one point of damage."

"One point?" I yelped. "But that's all I have!"

"Exactly! It’s very efficient. No wasted numbers. The System loves efficiency."

The slime launched.

It was a slow-motion nightmare. The green mass soared through the air, a wobbling orb of predatory citrus. I threw myself to the left, my shoulder hitting the dirt and sending a jolt of alarm through my entire body. 

[Stamina: 95/100]

I scrambled up, my breath coming in ragged gasps. The slime hit the spot where I’d been standing a split second before with a wet *thwack*, leaving a shimmering trail of corrosive mucus on the grass. The grass hissed and turned brown instantly.

"Missed!" I shouted, the adrenaline finally kicking in. "You see that, Fizz? Junior Analyst reflexes! I used to dodge 'Reply All' chains for a living!"

"Great job," Fizz deadpanned. "Now do it again. It’s turning around."

She was right. The slime was reorienting itself, its body rippling as it prepared for another jump. I looked around wildly for a weapon—a rock, a sturdy branch, a heavy stapler—but there was nothing but soft earth and tall, mockery-filled trees.

I backed away, but my heel caught on a protruding root. I stumbled, my arms flailing for balance. I felt the weight of my Cracked Smartphone in my pocket, shifting as I fell toward a dense thicket of thorns. 

I stopped just short of the briars, cornered. The slime was five feet away, and this time, it wasn't just contracting; it was vibrating. A low, wet hum filled the air.

"Fizz, help me out here," I hissed, my eyes locked on the wobbling green death. "There has to be a tutorial tip for this. 'How to not die to a puddle of juice'?"

"Tip number one," Fizz said, appearing right in front of my nose. "Don't get hit."

"That’s not a tip, that’s a tautology!"

"Tip number two: You have a 100% Crit Rate, Artie. If you hit it, you hit it *hard*. But you actually have to, you know, *hit* it."

I looked at my hands. They were shaking. My right knuckle, with its vending machine scar, was white-knuckled as I balled my hand into a fist. I was a Junior Analyst. I was a 'Statistical Anomaly.' And right now, I was a man about to be killed by a dessert topping.

The slime lunged again. This time, there was no room to roll. I could see the flecks of dirt inside its body, the sheer weight of the thing coming right for my chest. If it touched me, the '1/1' in my peripheral vision would go to zero. The game would end before it even began.

I realized then, with a clarity that only comes when you're facing a lethal blob of jelly, that this world didn't care about my resume. It didn't care about my potential. It only cared about the math. And the math said I was one mistake away from non-existence.

"Oh, crap," I whispered as the green shadow eclipsed the sun.
