# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
Item naming: use display_name for prose; use item_id only in JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Continuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.
Continuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.
Durable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.
Inventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

﻿Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.
Durable vs ephemeral mechanics:
- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.
- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.
- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).
- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.
For durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
For durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).
Use canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.


USER:

﻿# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Classify UI/prose mechanic claims as DURABLE or EPHEMERAL before enforcing.
  - DURABLE: persistent stats/caps, skills/titles acquired, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, named mechanics referenced as invariants.
  - EPHEMERAL: roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat telemetry.
- Enforce DURABLE claims against authoritative_surfaces/state/registries.
- EPHEMERAL claims do not require state ownership; only flag EPHEMERAL contradictions inside the same scene as warnings.
- If uncertain, default to EPHEMERAL (warning at most), not DURABLE (error).
- status="fail" only if there is at least one issue with severity="error"; warnings alone => status="pass".
- Treat only authoritative surfaces as canonical-check targets; do not enforce canonical labels in narrative prose.
- For authoritative surfaces, prefer exact canonical item/device labels from registries.
- For milestone repetition/future checks, compare against PRE-INVARIANTS only (pre-scene canon).
- For ownership/consistency checks, compare against POST-STATE (post-patch candidate).
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).
  - Ignore first-person pronouns inside quoted dialogue; only narration counts.
- Deterministically enforce scene-card durable constraints (required_in_custody, required_scene_accessible, forbidden_visible, device_presence; optional required_visible_on_page).
- Durable constraint evaluation must use POST-STATE candidate (after patch), not pre-state.
- Report missing durable context ids with explicit retry hints instead of guessing canon.
- For each issue, include evidence when possible (line number + excerpt) as {"evidence": {"line": N, "excerpt": "..."}}.

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity
- evidence

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The transition from the digital void to the Whispering Woods felt less like a magical teleportation and more like being shoved out of a moving car into a pile of damp laundry. Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon hit the forest floor with a thud that vibrated through his very soul—or whatever was left of it after the System finished digitizing his existence.

[Location: Whispering Woods (Tutorial Zone)]
[Environmental Status: Damp, Slightly Spooky, 100% Chance of Death]

"Welcome to the world of tomorrow, Artie! Try not to bleed on the grass; it’s a nightmare to get out of the textures," Fizz chirped. 

She was hovering a few feet above the moss, looking entirely too refreshed for someone who had just witnessed a man commit statistical suicide. She flipped through The Official System Guidebook, the pages crackling with a faint blue light.

Artie groaned, pushing himself up. His palms came away smeared with green slime and dirt. He looked down at his Standard Issue Jumpsuit. It was a grey, mesh-like fabric that offered all the defensive properties of a wet paper towel. 

"I feel... light," Artie muttered. "And not the 'I lost ten pounds' light. More like the 'I am made of glass and hope' light."

"That’s because you are," Fizz said, pointing a translucent finger at the air above his head. "Check your HUD. I think the System is still trying to decide if you’re a player or a very specific type of error message."

Artie looked up. The floating red bar was there, mocking him.

[HP: 1/1] (locked)

"One," Artie whispered. "It really is just one."

"On the bright side, you don't have to worry about complicated math during combat," Fizz offered, her wings buzzing with manic energy. "If a number bigger than zero touches you, you're a loot drop. It’s very binary. Very elegant."

A wet, squelching sound echoed through the clearing. It sounded like someone dropping a gallon of mayonnaise into a bathtub. Artie froze. To his left, a bush shuddered, and a translucent, lime-green blob wobbled into the light. It was about the size of a beach ball and looked suspiciously like it was made of industrial-strength dish soap.

[Lesser Forest Slime - Lvl 1]
[HP: 15/15]

"Oh, look! Your first tutorial mob," Fizz said, floating back to a safe distance. "Usually, players use these to test their basic attacks and maybe take a few hits to see how their armor feels. You... well, you might want to skip the 'taking hits' part."

The slime didn't have eyes, but it definitely had intent. It vibrated, its entire body rippling with a rhythmic, hungry intensity. It began to slide across the moss toward Artie. It wasn't fast, but it was persistent.

"Okay," Artie said, backing away. "It’s a slime. I’ve played games. You just... you hit it, right? I have 100% Crit Rate. I should be able to just poke it and it explodes."

[Crit Rate: 100%] (locked)

"Theoretically, yes," Fizz called out. "But remember, Artie, you have the Agility of a sedentary office chair. And that slime? It’s Level 1, but it’s still faster than a spreadsheet."

Artie stepped back again, his heel catching on a gnarled root. He stumbled, his heart hammering against his ribs—a frantic, 1-HP drumbeat. The slime surged forward, a glob of its acidic body stretching out like a questing tongue. It sizzled as it touched a patch of grass near Artie’s foot, turning the green blades into a blackened, smoking slurry.

[Warning: Corrosive Contact Detected]
[Estimated Damage: 2-4 HP per second]

"Two to four?" Artie’s voice went up an octave. "I only have one! That’s a 400% overkill!"

"The System loves a good rounding error," Fizz said, appearing to take notes in her manual.

Artie scrambled backward, his hands searching for a weapon, a rock, a particularly sturdy stick—anything. But the Whispering Woods were suspiciously clean of debris. The slime lunged again, a slow-motion leap that felt like a falling mountain of jelly. Artie twisted out of the way, the Standard Issue Jumpsuit brushing against a low-hanging branch.

[Stamina: 95/100]

He was breathing hard now. Every movement felt heavy, every step a gamble. He could see the individual bubbles trapped inside the slime’s body. It was close enough that he could smell it—a cloying, chemical scent like an over-cleaned hospital hallway.

He backed up one more step and his shoulder blades hit something hard and unforgiving. He glanced back. A massive, ancient oak tree blocked his path. Its bark was rough and indifferent to his plight.

He was trapped.

The slime stopped its slide a few feet away. It began to compress itself, drawing its gelatinous mass inward like a coiled spring. It was preparing to launch.

"Fizz?" Artie gulped.

"Yes, Artie?"

"If I die in the tutorial, do I get a refund on my life?"

"Checking..." Fizz flipped a page. "Nope. But you do get a very colorful 'Game Over' screen. I hear the music is quite catchy."

The slime vibrated one last time, a high-pitched hum that made Artie's teeth ache. He pressed his back against the tree, his eyes wide, realizing that in this world, 'Level 1' didn't mean 'Easy.' It meant 'Lethal.' 

The slime launched.
