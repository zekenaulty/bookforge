Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stood in the center of the nothingness, looking down at his new attire. The sensible, charcoal-grey slacks of a Senior Logistics Analyst were gone, replaced by a simple Linen Tunic that was surprisingly soft but offered the structural integrity of a wet paper towel. \n\nHe shifted the weight of the Broken Tutorial Sword in his right hand. It was a jagged, rusted length of iron that felt less like a weapon and more like a tetanus shot waiting to happen. In his pocket, a single copper coin clinked\u2014his entire net worth in this new, absurd reality.\n\n\"I\u2019m going to need to see a manager,\" Artie said to the emptiness. \"Or at least a technician. I\u2019m fairly certain my death was a result of faulty wiring in the Snack-O-Matic 3000, which constitutes a gross violation of workplace safety standards.\"\n\n\"Actually, it constitutes a gross violation of common sense,\" a voice chirped from behind him.\n\nArtie spun around, his sandals slapping against the invisible floor. A girl\u2014or a very convincing holographic approximation of one\u2014was hovering a few feet away. She was draped in a cloak of shimmering, translucent code, and her eyes were literal glowing asterisks that flickered as she scrolled through a translucent Data Slate held in her left hand.\n\n\"I\u2019m Fizz,\" she said, her tone dripping with the kind of boredom usually reserved for DMV employees. \"Your System Liaison. I\u2019m here to make sure you don't immediately delete yourself, though looking at your file, that might be an uphill battle. Arthur Penhaligon, right? The guy who lost a wrestling match with a vending machine?\"\n\n\"It was a draw,\" Artie corrected, lifting his chin. \"The machine is also dead. I took it down with me.\"\n\nFizz snorted, tapping her Data Slate. \"Let's see what the official record says.\" She flicked her wrist, and a window manifested in the air between them.\n\n[System Notification: Death Report]\n[Subject: Penhaligon, Arthur]\n[Cause of Death: Kinetic-Electrical Feedback Loop (Vending Machine Malfunction)]\n[Final Words: 'I paid for the Habanero Hoops, you bucket of bolts!']\n[Status: Isekai-Eligible (Pity Tier)]\n\n\"Pity tier?\" Artie echoed, his face reddening. \"I had a spreadsheet for my spreadsheets, Fizz. I was the king of optimization. I could find a three-percent margin in a desert.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Fizz said, waving the report away. \"Then you\u2019ll love this. It\u2019s time for character creation. You have fifty points to spend. Try not to put them all into 'Whining,' it\u2019s a hidden stat and the scaling is terrible.\"\n\nA massive blue UI panel shimmered into existence.\n\n[Character Creation: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]\n[Class: Unassigned]\n[Level: 1]\n\n[Attributes]\n[Strength: 5] (+) (-)\n[Agility: 5] (+) (-)\n[Intelligence: 5] (+) (-)\n[Vitality: 5] (+) (-)\n[Luck: 5] (+) (-)\n\n[Available Points: 50]\n\nArtie stared at the numbers. \"Five? That\u2019s it? That\u2019s the baseline for a human being?\"\n\n\"It\u2019s the 'Standard Mediocrity' package,\" Fizz said, leaning back in the air as if it were a recliner. \"Most people put their points into Vitality. You know, so they don't die when a slime sneezes on them. But hey, you\u2019re the optimization guy. Go nuts.\"\n\nArtie didn't look at Vitality. He was scrolling through the sub-menus, his eyes darting across the fine print of the System\u2019s logic. He found a tab labeled [Variance & Probability]. Inside was a single, golden slider: **Critical Hit Affinity.**\n\n\"Fizz,\" Artie said, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"What\u2019s the exchange rate on Luck?\"\n\n\"Luck?\" Fizz glanced over, her asterisk-eyes narrowing. \"It\u2019s a trap stat. One point of Luck costs five Attribute Points. It governs your 'Critical' outcomes. If you max it, you\u2019ll hit like a truck, but you\u2019ll have the durability of a soap bubble. The System balances the math, Artie. You can't have high variance and high stability.\"\n\nArtie looked at the Broken Tutorial Sword. He thought about the vending machine\u2014how he\u2019d shaken it and shaken it, and it hadn't budged until the surge hit. He didn't want stability. He wanted the surge.\n\n\"If I never get hit,\" Artie mused, \"I don't need health. And if every hit is a Critical Hit, I don't need Strength.\"\n\n\"Artie, don't,\" Fizz said, her boredom finally giving way to a flicker of alarm.\n\nArtie\u2019s finger blurred. He didn't just spend his fifty points; he began hitting the minus signs on his other stats. He drained his Strength to one. He drained his Agility, his Intelligence, and finally, his Vitality. The points flooded into the Luck slider, pushing it higher and higher until the UI began to pulse with a frantic, red light.\n\n[WARNING: Stat Imbalance Detected]\n[WARNING: Vitality dropping below Recommended Minimum (10)]\n[WARNING: Physical Integrity at Risk]\n\n\"You\u2019re going to spawn in as a ghost!\" Fizz shouted, reaching for the screen. \"Stop!\"\n\nArtie\u2019s finger hovered over the final confirmation. \"Optimization, Fizz. It\u2019s all about the margins.\"\n\nHe slammed his hand against the [CONFIRM] button.\n\nThe white void didn't just groan; it shrieked. A pillar of golden light erupted from the menu, engulfing Artie. He felt his very essence being stretched thin, his physical form becoming light and airy, as if he were made of nothing but potential and math.\n\n[System Notification: Build Confirmed]\n[New Title Acquired: Statistical Anomaly]\n[New Title Acquired: The Glassest Cannon]\n\n[Final Attributes]\n[Strength: 1]\n[Agility: 1]\n[Intelligence: 1]\n[Vitality: 1]\n[Luck: 99]\n\n[Calculated Combat Stats]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[MP: 1/1]\n[Critical Hit Rate: 100%]\n[Critical Hit Multiplier: 500%]\n\nThe light faded. Artie stood there, feeling... fragile. He looked at his hands; they were slightly translucent, the white void visible through his palms. He gripped the Broken Tutorial Sword, and a faint, golden hum vibrated through the hilt.\n\nFizz stared at him, her Data Slate frozen in mid-air. \"One,\" she whispered. \"You have one hit point, Artie. If you stub your toe, you\u2019re going to explode. If a bird poops on you, it\u2019s a Game Over. You are literally the most fragile thing in the history of the multiverse.\"\n\nArtie smiled, though even the effort of smiling felt like it might cost him half his stamina. \"But did you see the multiplier, Fizz? Five hundred percent. Every time I swing this rusted piece of junk, it\u2019s going to hit with the force of a falling moon.\"\n\n\"Assuming you survive the swing,\" Fizz muttered, her fingers flying across her slate as she tried to recalibrate her sensors. \"Fine. You want to play the 'Crit or Quit' game? Let\u2019s see how long you last.

Good luck, Artie. I\u2019ll start drafting your next obituary.\"\n\nThe white void began to dissolve, the floor falling away into a swirling vortex of green and brown.

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nMechanics contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and labels (stats/skills) must be sourced from state or explicitly updated in the state_patch. Do not invent numbers or canonical tokens.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the RNG-Hellscape\",\"goal\":\"Introduce Artie and his

He looked down at his feet, which were no longer encased in the sensible loafers he\u2019d worn to the office. Instead, they were wrapped in rough, itchy burlap. He looked at his right hand. The stapler he\u2019d been carrying\u2014part of a misguided attempt to defend his honor against the Snack-O-Matic 3000\u2014had been replaced by a jagged hunk of rusted iron that vaguely resembled a sword.\n\n\"This is a lawsuit,\" Artie muttered, his voice echoing in the infinite nothingness. \"This is a massive, multi-million dollar lawsuit. I had dental. I had a 401k. I had a bag of Zesty Ranch Habanero Hoops that was halfway out the dispenser.\"\n\n\"Actually, it was only three-quarters of the way out,\" a high-pitched, clinical voice corrected.\n\nArtie spun around, nearly tripping over his own burlap-covered toes. A girl\u2014or something that looked like a girl if girls were made of neon pixels and weaponized sarcasm\u2014was hovering three feet off the non-existent ground. She wore a visor that glowed with scrolling green text and held a translucent Data Slate that hummed with power.\n\n\"I\u2019m Fizz,\" she said, not looking up from her screen. \"Your assigned System Liaison. And let me just say, Arthur, I\u2019ve seen some pathetic exits, but 'Death by Vending Machine' is currently trending in the top five for this quarter. Very retro. Very sad.\"\n\n\"It was an electrical surge!\" Artie protested, waving the Broken Tutorial Sword. The weight of it was awkward, pulling at his wrist. \"The machine cheated me. I was just applying corrective force.\"\n\n\"You were shaking a three-hundred-pound metal box while standing in a puddle of spilled diet soda,\" Fizz said, finally looking at him. Her eyes were literal glowing asterisks. She tapped her Data Slate. \"Let\u2019s look at the official log, shall we?\"\n\n[System Log: Death Report]\n[Subject: Penhaligon, Arthur]\n[Cause of Death: Terminal Stupidity (Secondary: Electrocution)]\n[Final Words: 'Give me my Hoops, you oversized toaster!']\n[Status: Isekai-Eligible (Pity Tier)]\n\nArtie felt a vein throb in his temple. \"Pity tier? I was a Senior Logistics Analyst! I understand systems. I understand optimization. I was the king of the spreadsheet!\"\n\n\"Great,\" Fizz said, flicking her wrist. A massive, shimmering blue screen materialized between them. It was covered in sliders, numbers, and icons that looked suspiciously like a character creation menu from the RPGs Artie used to play when he should have been analyzing logistics. \"Then you won't mind optimizing your new life. You have 50 Attribute Points. Spend them wisely, or don't. Honestly, the sooner you die again, the sooner I get my lunch break.\"\n\nArtie stepped closer to the screen. The Broken Tutorial Sword felt heavier by the second, so he tucked it under his arm for a moment to poke at the UI.\n\n[Character Creation: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]\n[Class: Unassigned]\n[Level: 1]\n\n[Attributes]\n[Strength: 5] (+) (-)\n[Agility: 5] (+) (-)\n[Intelligence: 5] (+) (-)\n[Vitality: 5] (+) (-)\n[Luck: 5] (+) (-)\n\n[Available Points: 50]\n\n\"Five in everything,\" Artie mused. \"The baseline of mediocrity. Typical.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s the 'Standard Human' package,\" Fizz said, yawning. She began to clean her visor with a corner of her glowing cape. \"Most people put ten into Vitality so they don't get eaten by the first thing with teeth. But hey, you\u2019re the 'king of the spreadsheet.' You do you.\"\n\nArtie ignored her. He was scrolling through the sub-menus, looking for the hidden math. He found a tab labeled [Advanced Probability & Variance]. Inside was a single, golden slider: **Critical Hit Affinity.**\n\n\"What\u2019s this?\" Artie asked.\n\n\"Oh, that?\" Fizz glanced over. \"That\u2019s the Luck multiplier. It governs how often the System rounds up in your favor. But it\u2019s expensive. One point of Luck is worth five points of anything else. It\u2019s a trap stat. Only idiots and gamblers touch it.\"\n\nArtie\u2019s eyes narrowed. \"If I max this out, what happens to the math?\"\n\n\"You get a 'Critical Hit' on every successful strike,\" Fizz said, her voice dripping with boredom. \"But the System is a zero-sum engine, Arthur. To give you that kind of offensive variance, it has to pull from your stability. Your Vitality would bottom out. You\u2019d be a glass cannon without the cannon part. More like a glass... pebble.\"\n\nArtie looked at the slider. He looked at the Broken Tutorial Sword. He thought about the vending machine that had taken his life because he didn't have enough 'force' to get his snack. Never again. He wanted to be the surge, not the guy getting surged.\n\n\"Optimization,\" Artie whispered. \"If I never get hit, I don't need health. And if every hit is a crit, I don't need Strength.\"\n\n\"Wait, what are you doing?\" Fizz asked, her asterisks-eyes widening.\n\nArtie grabbed the Critical Hit Affinity slider and slammed it to the far right. He didn't just spend the 50 points; he started draining the other stats to pay for the overflow. The UI began to flicker. Warning lights flashed red.\n\n[WARNING: Stat Imbalance Detected]\n[WARNING: Vitality dropping below Recommended Minimum]\n[WARNING: Physical Integrity at Risk]\n\n\"Artie, stop! You\u2019re going to break the avatar before it even spawns!\" Fizz shouted, reaching for the screen.\n\nArtie\u2019s finger hit the [CONFIRM] button just as a massive surge of golden light erupted from the menu. The white void groaned, the sound of grinding gears echoing from the \"Great Login Screen\" itself.\n\n[System Notification: Build Confirmed]\n[New Title Acquired: Statistical Anomaly]\n[New Title Acquired: The Glassest Cannon]\n\n[Final Attributes]\n[Strength: 1]\n[Agility: 1]\n[Intelligence: 1]\n[Vitality: 1]\n[Luck: 99]\n\n[Calculated Combat Stats]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[MP: 1/1]\n[Critical Hit Rate: 100%]\n[Critical Hit Multiplier: 500%]\n\n\"One?\" Fizz whispered, staring at the screen in genuine horror. \"One hit point? Artie, a stiff breeze is a boss fight for you now. If you trip on a pebble, you\u2019re dead. If you sneeze too hard, you\u2019re dead. If a butterfly flaps its wings in the next kingdom over, you are statistically likely to explode!\"\n\nArtie felt... light. Dangerously light. He looked at his hands; they were slightly translucent around the edges. He gripped the Broken Tutorial Sword, and for the first time, he saw a faint, golden glow pulsing along the jagged edge.\n\n\"I won't trip,\" Artie said, though his knees felt a bit wobbly with a Strength stat of one. \"And I won't sneeze. I\u2019m going to crit this world until it gives me my change back.\"\n\n\"You\u2019re an idiot,\" Fizz said, but she was already typing furiously on her Data Slate. \"Fine. It\u2019s your funeral. Again. Initiating deployment to Tutorial Zone: The Whispering Woods.
