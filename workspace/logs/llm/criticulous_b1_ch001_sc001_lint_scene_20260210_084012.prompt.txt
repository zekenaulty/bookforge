# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
Item naming: use display_name for prose; use item_id only in JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Continuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.
Continuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.
Durable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.
Inventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

﻿Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.
Durable vs ephemeral mechanics:
- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.
- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.
- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).
- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.
For durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
For durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).
Use canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.


USER:

﻿# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Classify UI/prose mechanic claims as DURABLE or EPHEMERAL before enforcing.
  - DURABLE: persistent stats/caps, skills/titles acquired, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, named mechanics referenced as invariants.
  - EPHEMERAL: roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat telemetry.
- Enforce DURABLE claims against authoritative_surfaces/state/registries.
- EPHEMERAL claims do not require state ownership; only flag EPHEMERAL contradictions inside the same scene as warnings.
- If uncertain, default to EPHEMERAL (warning at most), not DURABLE (error).
- status="fail" only if there is at least one issue with severity="error"; warnings alone => status="pass".
- Treat only authoritative surfaces as canonical-check targets; do not enforce canonical labels in narrative prose.
- For authoritative surfaces, prefer exact canonical item/device labels from registries.
- For milestone repetition/future checks, compare against PRE-INVARIANTS only (pre-scene canon).
- For ownership/consistency checks, compare against POST-STATE (post-patch candidate).
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).
  - Ignore first-person pronouns inside quoted dialogue; only narration counts.
- Deterministically enforce scene-card durable constraints (required_in_custody, required_scene_accessible, forbidden_visible, device_presence; optional required_visible_on_page).
- Durable constraint evaluation must use POST-STATE candidate (after patch), not pre-state.
- Report missing durable context ids with explicit retry hints instead of guessing canon.
- For each issue, include evidence when possible (line number + excerpt) as {"evidence": {"line": N, "excerpt": "..."}}.

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity
- evidence

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The coil turned with the agonizing Slowness of a dial-up connection in a hurricane. Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon leaned his forehead against the cool, scratched glass of the Break-O-Matic 3000, his breath fogging the view of his only reason for living: a crinkled blue bag of Salt & Vinegar chips at coordinate C-4. 

[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon - Lvl 1 Office Drone]
[HP: 10/10]

"Come on, you mechanical extortionist," Artie muttered. He shifted his weight, feeling the restrictive pull of his Silk Tie. It was a cheap polyester blend that promised "executive sheen" but delivered "slow strangulation." 

In his right hand, he clutched his Leather Wallet, the imitation cowhide sweaty against his palm. His left hand was a closed fist around a few remaining pieces of Loose Change—the metallic shrapnel of a failed morning. He’d already fed the machine four quarters, two dimes, and a nickel that looked like it had been chewed by a disgruntled badger. 

The coil stopped. 

The bag of chips dangled, hooked by a single plastic corner, suspended over the drop chute like a climber clinging to a cliff face in a bad action movie. It didn't fall. It didn't move. It just mocked him.

"You’ve got to be kidding me," Artie said, his Sarcasm skill—currently his only level 10 attribute—itching for a workout. "I’ve spent three hours today entering quarterly data for a manager who thinks 'The Cloud' is where God keeps his emails. I have earned these chips. I have bled for these chips. Metaphorically. Mostly from papercuts."

He tapped the glass. Nothing. He gave the machine a firm nudge with his shoulder. The Break-O-Matic 3000 responded with a low, ominous hum that sounded less like a cooling fan and more like a dragon with a sinus infection.

[Skill Check: Sarcasm - Success!]
"Oh, great. Now you’re growling at me. What’s next? A paywall for the napkins?"

Artie looked down at the Loose Change in his left hand. One more quarter. If he could just jar the machine enough to break the stalemate at C-4, he might survive the afternoon without biting a coworker. He reached out to stabilize himself against the metal frame of the machine, his Leather Wallet still gripped tightly in his right hand.

The hum changed frequency. It went from a low rumble to a high-pitched whine that made the fillings in Artie’s teeth vibrate. 

Inside the machine, the fluorescent light flickered, then died. A smell of ozone and scorched caramel filled the breakroom. Artie should have pulled away. A sensible man, a man with more than 4 points in Data Entry and a survival instinct that wasn't currently clouded by vinegar-scented desire, would have stepped back.

Instead, Artie kicked the base of the machine.

"Give. Me. My. Chips."

The machine didn't give him chips. It gave him three hundred volts of unadulterated, poorly-grounded fury.

A spark the size of a golf ball leaped from the coin slot to Artie’s knuckles. The world didn't go black immediately; it went neon violet. He felt the surge travel up his arm, dancing through the Silk Tie like a lightning rod, and exiting through his heels. 

[Critical Hit! -12 HP]

[Warning: Health has reached 0. Initiating Emergency Egress.]

Artie didn't even have time to scream. His vision pixelated. The drab beige walls of the office breakroom began to tear at the seams, revealing a vast, shimmering grid of white light beneath the reality he’d known. The sensation was less like dying and more like being deleted by a frustrated IT intern.

"I... still... paid..." he managed to choke out, though he wasn't sure if he was speaking or just thinking in binary.

The floor vanished. The vending machine vanished. The lingering scent of Salt & Vinegar was replaced by the sterile, scentless vacuum of the infinite. 

Artie tumbled into the white. He was no longer standing; he was floating, suspended in a pressurized void that hummed with the collective energy of a billion server racks. His Leather Wallet and Loose Change were gone, dissolved into data packets. Even his Silk Tie had stripped away, leaving him in a default, grey-mesh jumpsuit that felt suspiciously like pajamas.

[System Notification: Welcome, User 402-99-ARTIE.]
[Status: Deceased (Local Reality)]
[Status: Pending (System Integration)]

"Where am I?" Artie asked. His voice didn't echo. It just sat there, flat and digital.

[You are in the Character Creation Void. Please wait while your life's 'Achievements' are calculated.]

Artie squinted. In front of him, a giant, floating semi-transparent screen flickered into existence. It was covered in progress bars, most of which were depressingly empty.

[Calculating 'Career Success'... 0.02%]
[Calculating 'Social Impact'... 0.01%]
[Calculating 'Total Luck'... Error: Value too low to display.]

"Hey!" Artie shouted at the void. "I was a Senior Data Entry Associate! I had a 401k! Sort of!"

[Calculation Complete.]
[Base Stats assigned based on previous life performance.]
[Warning: Statistical Anomaly detected in 'Fortitude' and 'Luck' sectors.]

Artie watched as the screen shifted, revealing a series of sliders and numbers that made his head spin. He didn't know what was happening, but he knew one thing for certain: the vending machine had definitely won that round.
