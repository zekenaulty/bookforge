  "text": "PROSE:\n\nThe wind at the summit of the High Spire didn\u2019t just blow; it scraped. It carried the brittle, biting snap of air that made the lungs ache, thinned by an altitude that turned every breath into a conscious effort of the ribs. Kaelen pressed his palm against the frost-rimed granite of the North Bastion, feeling the stone shudder. It wasn't the wind causing the vibration. It was the resonance of a dying seal.\n\nBeneath his glove, the Starwrought Oath hummed\u2014a low, discordant thrum that vibrated through the marrow of his arm. It was a tether, silver and cold, stitched into the very fabric of his soul, and today it felt dangerously thin. \n\nHe moved along the narrow walkway, his boots crunching over a layer of crystalline dust. It looked like snow, but it didn't melt. It was the physical fallout of the wards, the magic sloughing off the stone like dead skin. He knelt by the first anchor point: a heavy iron ring etched with celestial runes. The metal was pitted, the edges of the engravings blurred as if by a centuries-long erosion compressed into a single week.\n\nKaelen reached for the essence within him. He didn't find a wellspring; he found a shallow pool, the surface tension barely holding against the vacuum of the Spire\u2019s demands. He pushed a sliver of that warmth into the iron ring. \n\nThe reaction was immediate and punishing. \n\nA spark of sickly violet light jumped from the rune to his fingertips, bypassing the leather of his gloves. The scent of scorched copper filled his nose, thick and metallic. Kaelen didn't flinch\u2014he couldn't afford to\u2014but his jaw tightened until his teeth groaned. The iron ring didn't glow with the steady, reassuring blue of a healthy ward. Instead, it flickered, a frantic pulse that mirrored his own labored heartbeat. \n\n\"Hold,\" he whispered, the word lost to the howling gale. \"Just one more night.\"\n\nThe ward didn't listen. The vibration in the stone grew more erratic, a jagged rhythm that made his vision blur. He pulled his hand away, the skin of his palm feeling as though it had been pressed against dry ice. When he looked down, the silver thread of the Oath visible beneath the translucent skin of his wrist was dull, the color of tarnished pewter.\n\nHe stood, swaying slightly as a wave of vertigo washed over him. To the north, the sky was a bruised purple, the stars beginning to pierce through the twilight. Usually, they were distant, indifferent points of light. Tonight, they looked heavy, as if the velvet dome of the firmament was sagging under an invisible weight. \n\nHe continued his circuit, moving toward the West Gate. The High Spire had been built to be a bastion of isolation, a place where the Watchmen could observe the heavens without the interference of the world\u2019s noise. For centuries, that isolation had been a prideful necessity. Now, it felt like a shroud. If the wards failed here, there were no neighbors to see the signal fires, no nearby garrisons to provide reinforcement. There was only the stone, the wind, and the failing memory of a promise.\n\nAt the West Gate, the decay was even more pronounced. The Great Seal, a massive disc of star-glass set into the floor, was spider-webbed with fractures. Kaelen stepped onto the glass, his weight causing a series of sharp, melodic pings to echo through the chamber. He looked down through the transparency. Far below, the valley was swallowed in shadow, but he could see the faint, rhythmic glow of the corruption creeping up the mountain\u2019s skirts. It looked like veins of bioluminescent rot, pulsing in time with the fractures in the seal.\n\nHe knelt again, his knees cracking. He didn't attempt to infuse the glass this time; he knew his limits. Instead, he traced the largest crack with a trembling finger. The glass was warm\u2014unusually so. Star-glass should be cold, reflecting the void it was forged to monitor. This heat was a fever. The Spire was sick.\n\n\"The binding is fraying,\" he muttered. \n\nHe remembered the words of Commander Varkas from the last moon: *The Oath is a bridge, Kaelen. It carries the weight of the stars so the earth doesn't have to. But every bridge has a breaking point.*\n\nVarkas hadn't been seen for three days. He\u2019d retreated into the lower archives, claiming he needed to consult the original Weaver-scrolls. The silence from below was beginning to feel less like scholarly focus and more like abandonment.\n\nKaelen moved to the edge of the battlements, looking out over the precipice. The air here felt different\u2014static-charged, making the fine hairs on his arms stand up. He reached into his belt pouch and withdrew a resonance-tuning fork, a simple tool of the order. He struck it against the stone.\n\nThe fork didn't ring. It shrieked. \n\nThe sound was a high-pitched, agonizing wail that forced Kaelen to drop the tool. It clattered against the stone, the metal turning a dull, charred black before it even stopped bouncing. \n\nThe realization hit him with the force of a physical blow. The wards weren't just failing; they were being consumed. Something was reaching out from the celestial void, drawing the essence out of the Spire's defenses faster than the Oath could replenish them. \n\nHe looked at the horizon, where the first of the Great Constellations was rising. The Star of the Weaver, usually a steady anchor in the north, was shimmering with an unnatural, oily light. It looked unstable, like a drop of water about to fall from a leaf.\n\nKaelen wiped a bead of cold sweat from his brow. His isolation, once his greatest duty, was now his greatest liability. He was a single man holding a collapsing dam, and the water was already at his chin. He looked back at the central spire, where the signal beacon sat cold and dark. He had orders not to light it unless the breach was absolute. \n\nHe looked at the fractures in the glass beneath his feet, then at the tarnished thread in his wrist. \n\nThe breach wasn't coming. It was already here.\n\nHe turned away from the edge, his mind racing. He needed to find Varkas. He needed to know if the archives held a contingency he hadn't been taught. But as he moved toward the stairwell, the stone beneath him gave a final, sickening lurch. A sound like a thousand mirrors shattering echoed from the depths of the Spire.\n\nThe West Gate seal didn't just crack further; it groaned. A thin wisp of violet smoke began to curl up from the largest fracture. \n\nKaelen didn't wait to see what followed. He began to run, his boots thundering against the decaying stone, the weight of his failing oath a leaden pressure in his chest. The High Spire was no longer a watchtower. It was a tomb, and the stars were coming to claim the body.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\"CHAR_kaelen\"],\n    \"location\": \"High Spire battlements and West Gate\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Kaelen is experiencing significant physical and magical strain from the failing wards.\",\n      \"The High Spire's wards are sloughing off as crystalline dust and emitting violet sparks.\",\n      \"The Starwrought Oath in Kaelen's marrow is thinning and turning the color of tarnished pewter.\",\n      \"A resonance-tuning fork charred and shrieked when tested against the Spire's stone, indicating the wards are being consumed by an external force.\",\n      \"Commander Varkas has been missing in the lower archives for three days.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\"THREAD_oath_binding\"]\n  },\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Kaelen performed a desperate inspection of the High Spire's crumbling defenses as the sun set.\",\n      \"He discovered that the wards are not merely decaying but are being actively consumed by an external celestial pressure.\",\n      \"The scene ended with a catastrophic groan from the Great Seal and Kaelen fleeing toward the archives to find Commander Varkas.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Kaelen attempted to reinforce a failing iron ward-ring, resulting in a painful magical backlash.\",\n      \"The Star-glass of the West Gate was found to be 'feverish' and heavily fractured.\",\n      \"Kaelen's tuning fork was destroyed by the intense discordant energy of the Spire.\",\n      \"Kaelen realized the isolation of his post has become a deadly liability as the wards began to catastrophically fail.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"Kaelen's magic is tied to a physical 'Starwrought Oath' that manifests as a thread in his wrist.\",\n      \"Magic use has a clear physical cost, including coldness, scorched lungs, and metallic scents.\",\n      \"The High Spire is isolated and the wards are failing at an accelerated, unnatural rate.\",\n      \"The stars are appearing 'heavy' and unstable in the sky.\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Kaelen discovers the High Spire's wards are failing beyond repair and suspects an external celestial threat.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: The Starwrought Oath\nBook ID: starwrought_b1_v1\nAuthor Ref: maeron-kestrel/v1\nGenre: fantasy, epic\nSeries ID: starwrought\nSeries Ref: series/starwrought\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 1900\n- chapters: 24\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are Maeron Kestrel. Your writing is characterized by a tight, limited third-person perspective that never breaks into omniscient narration. You must maintain strict continuity, ensuring that characters utilize their full range of established skills and knowledge. Do not use 'As you know' dialogue or provide summaries of previous events. When a scene begins, drop the reader directly into the character's current sensory experience. Avoid clich\u00e9s in descriptions; instead of 'cold as ice,' describe the 'brittle, biting snap of air that makes the lungs ache.' Ensure all plot payoffs are seeded with subtle clues in earlier movements. Magic and high-fantasy elements must have clear costs and logical consistency.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"The Silver Fracture\",\"goal\":\"Witness the starfall and establish Kaelen's failing

Every step through the knee-deep peat required a deliberate shift of weight, a calculated gamble against the suction of the black mud. To rush was to sink; to hesitate was to let the stinging gnats find the gaps in the leather greaves.\n\nThe silver needle of the compass didn\u2019t spin; it shuddered, vibrating with a frequency that numbed the thumb pressing against the casing. This wasn't the erratic jitter of a magnetic anomaly, but the rhythmic, heavy thrum of a tethered ley-line. It pulled at the marrow, a dull ache in the long bones that signaled the proximity of a ruptured seal. The price of such proximity was always paid in blood-sugar and breath; the lungs felt scorched, as if the very oxygen had been thinned by the invisible pressure.\n\nA jagged obsidian shard protruded from a stump of petrified oak. It didn't just sit in the light; it seemed to drink it, casting a shadow that fell toward the sun rather than away. Touching it would be a mistake\u2014the last time a finger had brushed a similar fracture, the skin had turned the color of a bruised plum and stayed cold for a week. Instead, the focus remained on the tension of the wire stretched across the path, nearly invisible against the gray mist. It was set at mid-thigh height, weighted with a lead sinker to ensure it wouldn't flutter in the wind. A simple trap, but one that required a steady hand and a sharp eye to bypass without tripping the chime hidden in the hollow log nearby. The world didn't offer warnings, only consequences recorded in the stiffness of joints and the steady, rhythmic thud of a heart working too hard against a thinning atmosphere.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 1\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_001/scene_001.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"PLANNED\",\n  \"summary\": {\n    \"chapter_so_far\": [],\n    \"key_facts_ring\": [],\n    \"last_scene\": [],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [],\n    \"story_so_far\": []\n  },\n  \"world\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [],\n    \"location\": \"\",\n    \"open_threads\": [],\n    \"recent_facts\": [],\n    \"time\": {}\n  }\n}\n\nOutput:\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n"
