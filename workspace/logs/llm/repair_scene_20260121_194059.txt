PROSE:
The floor of the Inner Sanctum did not merely tilt; it groaned, a deep, tectonic shearing of stone and ancient magic that vibrated through the soles of Kaelen’s boots. Gravity had become a fickle suggestion. He lunged for the doorframe, his left hand catching the cold, carved granite while his right arm—wrapped in a sleeve of blackened, starwrought scarring—throbbed with a rhythmic, mechanical heat.

*Thump-hiss.*

The physical star-shard in his satchel was vibrating with a violent, rhythmic resonance. Every pulse sent a needle of violet light through the leather, illuminating the swirling dust and the ash that remained of Commander Varkas. Kaelen didn't look back at the grey smudge on the floor. He couldn't. The physical pewter filament woven into his radius bone—the tangible anchor of his Starwrought Oath—shuddered against his marrow, grinding with a metallic screech that only he could hear. It was the sound of a lock being forced, a cage breaking open from the inside.

He threw himself into the corridor. The High Spire was screaming. Massive blocks of masonry, held aloft for centuries by the Order’s wards, were now succumbing to the violet rot eating the foundations. The air smelled of scorched copper and the brittle, biting snap of ozone that made his lungs ache with every gasp. 

A section of the vaulted ceiling collapsed twenty paces ahead, bringing down a chandelier of star-glass that shattered into a thousand jagged diamonds. Kaelen didn't slow. He vaulted over a heap of smoking rubble, his boots skidding on a slick of Star-Bleed—the viscous, glowing fluid, like melted wax mixed with mercury, that leaked from the Spire’s fracturing stones. 

"Not yet," he hissed, his voice a dry rasp. He adjusted the strap of the satchel, feeling the hard, cylindrical weight of the Star-Maps in their brass casing pressed against his ribs. The shard within the bag remained a heavy, solid presence, its resonance growing more violent as the Spire's own structural integrity failed.

The Spire lurched violently to the west. Kaelen was thrown against the wall, his scarred right arm taking the impact. A flare of white-hot agony erupted from the physical pewter filament in his arm, a sensation like molten lead being poured into his veins. He choked back a cry, his vision blurring. The black scarring on his skin seemed to writhe, the patterns of the starfall etched into his flesh like a map of his own damnation.

He pushed off the wall and kept moving. The main staircase was gone, replaced by a jagged abyss that looked down into the swirling, violet-choked heart of the valley. The Spire wasn't just falling; it was being unmade, its essence being drawn into the rift created by the star’s impact. 

Kaelen took the service stairs, a narrow spiral of stone that hugged the outer skin of the tower. Here, the wind howled through the cracks, carrying the scent of the dying world—a mix of wet earth and something alien, something cold and vast. The stones beneath his feet were humming, the *thump-hiss* of the physical shard in his bag synchronizing with the death-throes of the building.

He reached the landing of the third floor, and the wall simply ceased to exist. 

A gust of freezing air nearly swept him into the void. Kaelen flattened himself against the remaining masonry, staring out at the carnage. The High Spire, once the tallest reach of human ambition, was tilting at a forty-five-degree angle. Below, the valley floor was a sea of shattered glass and rising shadow. The impact site glowed with a rhythmic light, calling to the shard in Kaelen’s possession.

He could see the battlements now—a jagged tongue of stone protruding over the emptiness. It was his only way out. 

He ran. The corridor was a slide of debris and Star-Bleed. He used the momentum, sliding down the incline, his boots throwing up sparks as they caught on the metal rivets of the floorboards. A support beam groaned and snapped above him, a ton of timber and lead-glass crashing down exactly where he had stood a second before.

The pewter filament in his arm vibrated so hard his fingers went numb. The Oath was failing, the bond that tied him to the Spire’s purpose dissolving as the Spire itself died. He felt the phantom weight of his brothers and sisters—the hundreds of Wardens who had stood watch here—their shadows flickering in the violet light before being consumed by the encroaching dark.

He reached the door to the battlements. It was jammed, the frame warped by the Spire’s lean. Kaelen didn't waste time with the latch. He braced his shoulder against the wood and channeled a sliver of the shard’s resonance through the physical pewter filament in his bone. 

The door didn't just open; it disintegrated into splinters and dust.

Kaelen stumbled out onto the wind-whipped ledge. The world was a roar of sound and light. The sky was bruised purple, the stars above obscured by a veil of shimmering dust. The Spire gave a final, terminal shudder. The sound of the primary supports shearing was like a thunderclap that didn't end.

He checked the satchel one last time. The Star-Maps were secure. The physical shard was warm, a steady, terrifying resonance against his side. 

"I am the watchman," he whispered, the old words of the Oath feeling like ash in his mouth. "And the watch is ended."

He didn't jump; he stepped off into the air.

The sensation of weightlessness was a brief, cold mercy. The wind tore the breath from his lungs as he plummeted, the Spire receding above him like a falling mountain. He saw it then—the moment of total failure. The High Spire didn't just hit the ground. It reached the limit of its structural reality and began to fold in on itself, the stones turning to smoke and violet light before they even touched the earth.

Kaelen hit a slope of scree and shattered glass, the impact jarring every bone in his body. He tumbled, a chaotic blur of pain and freezing air, until he slammed into a stand of petrified trees at the edge of the Spire’s footprint.

For a long minute, there was only the sound of his own ragged breathing and the distant, grinding roar of the collapse. 

He pushed himself up, his muscles screaming in protest. His right arm was a mask of blood and soot, the black scarring standing out in stark relief against his pale skin. He looked back.

The High Spire was gone. Where the great tower had stood for a thousand years, there was only a hollow in the world—a smudge of violet mist and a lingering, rhythmic hum. The silence that followed was heavier than the noise had been.

Kaelen reached into his satchel, his fingers brushing the cool brass of the Star-Map cylinder and the pulsing heat of the physical shard. He was alone. He was injured. He was a fugitive from an Order that no longer existed, carrying a relic that was eating him alive.

The *thump-hiss* of the shard grew louder, a steady drumbeat in the quiet of the ruins. 

Kaelen turned his back on the void and began to walk, his shadow stretching long and thin across the scorched earth, toward a horizon that no longer held the stars he knew.
