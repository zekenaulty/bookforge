PROSE:

The Gilded Tankard was exactly the kind of place a man with 1 HP should avoid: it had slippery floors, heavy oak furniture with sharp corners, and a chandelier that looked like it was held up by a single, optimistic piece of twine. But Oakhaven’s streets were currently teeming with people who had seen the "Statistical Anomaly" flare at the gate, and Artie needed a roof that didn't involve a public interrogation.

He stepped through the swinging doors, his fingers cramping around his gear. He held the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) in his right hand—less of a weapon and more of a tactical nuke in his hands—and the glowing, neon-purple Participation Trophy in his left. The trophy was vibrating. It wasn't a "you did a good job" vibration; it was a "I am a beacon for every hungry thing within a three-mile radius" hum.

[Warning: Aggro Aura (Active)]
[Radius: 15 Meters]
[Current Threat Level: Low (For now...)]

"I hate this thing," Artie whispered. "Fizz, if you’re lurking in the UI somewhere, just know I’m going to melt this down into a very expensive paperweight the first chance I get."

The tavern was surprisingly quiet for midday. A few patrons sat in the shadows, their eyes tracking the bulge in Artie’s pocket where the Anomaly ID Tag sat. Even stowed away, the brass tag felt like it was radiating heat, a mark of shame that told the world he was a walking bug. He tried to find a corner, but the System—and his trophy—had other plans.

A floorboard creaked. Then came the scratching.

From beneath a nearby table, a pair of red eyes ignited. It wasn't a wolf or a goblin, but in this world, scale was relative.

[Tavern Rat - Lvl 1]
[HP: 3/3]
[Status: Extremely Agitated by Your Existence]

The rat was the size of a small badger and had a jagged scar across its snout. It hissed, its whiskers twitching in time with the trophy’s hum. The Aggro Aura was doing its job, which was to say, it was making Artie’s life a living hell.

"Oh, come on," Artie muttered, shifting his weight. "I’m Level 2. I’ve caused the death of a coyote. You really want to do this, Templeton?"

The rat lunged. 

It was a blur of grey fur and yellow teeth, aiming straight for Artie’s ankle. At 1 HP, a nip from a rodent wasn't a nuisance; it was a Game Over screen. Artie swung the Prop sword in a panicked arc. He didn't have the Agility for a clean parry, but he had the math.

[Critical Hit! -999 Damage]
[Overkill Bonus: +5 XP]

The sword didn't just hit the rat. It seemed to distort the air around it. Upon contact, the rat didn't die so much as it ceased to be a biological entity. There was a sound like a pressurized steam pipe bursting, and the rodent vanished in a cloud of fine, grey mist and a single, shimmering copper coin that clattered onto the floor.

"Clean-up on aisle four," Artie breathed, his heart hammering against his ribs. He looked at his health bar, which remained a terrifying, solitary [1/1]. "One hit. That’s all it takes. I’m living in a world made of needles and I’m a balloon."

"Impressive," a voice boomed from the back of the room. "Most adventurers at your level struggle with the vermin. You simply... deleted it."

Artie spun around, nearly tripping over his own feet. A man stood by the hearth, dressed in robes of deep burgundy and gold silk. He held a Bag of Gold in his left hand, the coins clinking with a heavy, rhythmic weight. On his chest sat a heavy silver medallion: the Seal of Office.

[Mayor of Oakhaven - Lvl ???]
[Disposition: Opportunistic]

"You're the Mayor," Artie said, not lowering the sword. 

"I am Mayor Whitlock," the man said, stepping forward. He glanced at Artie’s pocket, then back to his face. "And you are the 100% Crit. The gate guards haven't stopped talking about the man who critted the very air itself to survive a coyote."

"It was a fluke," Artie said quickly. "I’m actually very weak. Look at my HP. I’m basically a stiff breeze away from a funeral."

Whitlock smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. "In most places, 1 HP is a tragedy. In Oakhaven, it’s a curiosity. But a 100% Critical Hit rate? That, my friend, is an industry."

The Mayor gestured to a private booth. "Sit. Please. I believe we have much to discuss regarding your... utility."

Artie hesitated, then sat, keeping the trophy on the table where he could see it. The Aggro Aura was still humming, making the nearby ale-mugs rattle. 

"Utility?" Artie asked. "I'm not a Swiss Army knife. I'm a glass ornament."

"You don't understand our economy, Arthur," Whitlock said, leaning in. He pulled a small, glowing crystal from a pouch at his belt. It pulsed with a soft, blue light. "This is an Essence Shard. It is the fuel for our enchantments, the power for our wards, and the only currency the High Priests of RNG accept for Tier-3 gear."

Artie looked at the shard. "And let me guess. You don't find these in the dirt."

"No," Whitlock said. "Essence Shards are minted. They are the crystallized residue of 'Excessive Force.' When a blow lands with enough mathematical perfection—a Critical Hit, specifically—the System bleeds off a small amount of raw data. We capture that data and forge it into shards."

Artie felt a cold lump form in his stomach. "So, a normal fighter crits maybe five percent of the time?"

"If they're lucky," the Mayor said. "They spend hours in the pits, swinging until their arms go numb, hoping for that one-in-twenty spark to fill a single shard. But you... you are a font. Every strike you land, no matter how small, is a perfect release of energy. You aren't just an adventurer, Arthur. You are a walking mint."

[New Discovery: The Crit-Economy]
[Information: Your 100% Crit rate can be harnessed to generate Essence Shards. Value: Extreme.]

"You want to turn me into a battery," Artie said, his voice flat. 

"I want to offer you protection," Whitlock countered. "Oakhaven is a dangerous place for an Anomaly. There are... elements... who would see your 1 HP as an invitation. But under my patronage, you would have the finest guards. You would spend your days in a secure vault, striking a target dummy. We would provide the Shard-Cages, and you would provide the hits. You’d be the wealthiest man in the province without ever having to risk a scratch."

Artie looked at his character sheet, which flickered in his peripheral vision.

[Name: Artie Penhaligon]
[Level: 2]
[HP: 1/1]
[Unallocated Stat Points: 5]

The "plus" icons next to Vitality and Strength pulsed, urging him to commit. If he put all five into Vitality, maybe he’d have 50 HP. Maybe he’d survive a fall or a stray splinter. But the moment he spent those points, he was playing the System’s game. He was accepting the 'proper' path. And the 'proper' path in this world seemed to lead directly into a gilded cage.

"I'm not interested in being a battery," Artie said.

Whitlock’s smile faltered. "Arthur, be reasonable. Look at your stats. You have five points sitting there, unspent. You're terrified to use them because you know that even with them, you’re still fragile. Why struggle in the wild when you can be a god in a basement?"

"Because in the basement, you own the key," Artie said. He stood up, grabbing the trophy. The Aggro Aura flared as he moved, and another rat scurried across the rafters above, lured by the scent of his existence.

"You're making a mistake," Whitlock said, his voice dropping an octave. "There are others who won't be as polite as I am. Vane, for instance, has very little patience for 'anomalies' that don't serve the greater good."

Artie didn't wait to hear more. The word 'scouted' was flashing in his mind like a neon sign. He wasn't a guest; he was a resource.

He turned and bolted for the exit, the Participation Trophy's purple glow trailing behind him like a comet's tail. He burst through the swinging doors back into the afternoon sun of Oakhaven. He needed to hide. He needed to find a place where the math didn't matter, or at least a place where people didn't know how to count his crits.
