He looked down at his feet, which were no longer encased in the sensible loafers he\u2019d worn to the office. Instead, they were wrapped in rough, itchy burlap. He looked at his right hand. The stapler he\u2019d been carrying\u2014part of a misguided attempt to defend his honor against the Snack-O-Matic 3000\u2014had been replaced by a jagged hunk of rusted iron that vaguely resembled a sword.\n\n\"This is a lawsuit,\" Artie muttered, his voice echoing in the infinite nothingness. \"This is a massive, multi-million dollar lawsuit. I had dental. I had a 401k. I had a bag of Zesty Ranch Habanero Hoops that was halfway out the dispenser.\"\n\n\"Actually, it was only three-quarters of the way out,\" a high-pitched, clinical voice corrected.\n\nArtie spun around, nearly tripping over his own burlap-covered toes. A girl\u2014or something that looked like a girl if girls were made of neon pixels and weaponized sarcasm\u2014was hovering three feet off the non-existent ground. She wore a visor that glowed with scrolling green text and held a translucent Data Slate that hummed with power.\n\n\"I\u2019m Fizz,\" she said, not looking up from her screen. \"Your assigned System Liaison. And let me just say, Arthur, I\u2019ve seen some pathetic exits, but 'Death by Vending Machine' is currently trending in the top five for this quarter. Very retro. Very sad.\"\n\n\"It was an electrical surge!\" Artie protested, waving the Broken Tutorial Sword. The weight of it was awkward, pulling at his wrist. \"The machine cheated me. I was just applying corrective force.\"\n\n\"You were shaking a three-hundred-pound metal box while standing in a puddle of spilled diet soda,\" Fizz said, finally looking at him. Her eyes were literal glowing asterisks. She tapped her Data Slate. \"Let\u2019s look at the official log, shall we?\"\n\n[System Log: Death Report]\n[Subject: Penhaligon, Arthur]\n[Cause of Death: Terminal Stupidity (Secondary: Electrocution)]\n[Final Words: 'Give me my Hoops, you oversized toaster!']\n[Status: Isekai-Eligible (Pity Tier)]\n\nArtie felt a vein throb in his temple. \"Pity tier? I was a Senior Logistics Analyst! I understand systems. I understand optimization. I was the king of the spreadsheet!\"\n\n\"Great,\" Fizz said, flicking her wrist. A massive, shimmering blue screen materialized between them. It was covered in sliders, numbers, and icons that looked suspiciously like a character creation menu from the RPGs Artie used to play when he should have been analyzing logistics. \"Then you won't mind optimizing your new life. You have 50 Attribute Points. Spend them wisely, or don't. Honestly, the sooner you die again, the sooner I get my lunch break.\"\n\nArtie stepped closer to the screen. The Broken Tutorial Sword felt heavier by the second, so he tucked it under his arm for a moment to poke at the UI.\n\n[Character Creation: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]\n[Class: Unassigned]\n[Level: 1]\n\n[Attributes]\n[Strength: 5] (+) (-)\n[Agility: 5] (+) (-)\n[Intelligence: 5] (+) (-)\n[Vitality: 5] (+) (-)\n[Luck: 5] (+) (-)\n\n[Available Points: 50]\n\n\"Five in everything,\" Artie mused. \"The baseline of mediocrity. Typical.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s the 'Standard Human' package,\" Fizz said, yawning. She began to clean her visor with a corner of her glowing cape. \"Most people put ten into Vitality so they don't get eaten by the first thing with teeth. But hey, you\u2019re the 'king of the spreadsheet.' You do you.\"\n\nArtie ignored her. He was scrolling through the sub-menus, looking for the hidden math. He found a tab labeled [Advanced Probability & Variance]. Inside was a single, golden slider: **Critical Hit Affinity.**\n\n\"What\u2019s this?\" Artie asked.\n\n\"Oh, that?\" Fizz glanced over. \"That\u2019s the Luck multiplier. It governs how often the System rounds up in your favor. But it\u2019s expensive. One point of Luck is worth five points of anything else. It\u2019s a trap stat. Only idiots and gamblers touch it.\"\n\nArtie\u2019s eyes narrowed. \"If I max this out, what happens to the math?\"\n\n\"You get a 'Critical Hit' on every successful strike,\" Fizz said, her voice dripping with boredom. \"But the System is a zero-sum engine, Arthur. To give you that kind of offensive variance, it has to pull from your stability. Your Vitality would bottom out. You\u2019d be a glass cannon without the cannon part. More like a glass... pebble.\"\n\nArtie looked at the slider. He looked at the Broken Tutorial Sword. He thought about the vending machine that had taken his life because he didn't have enough 'force' to get his snack. Never again. He wanted to be the surge, not the guy getting surged.\n\n\"Optimization,\" Artie whispered. \"If I never get hit, I don't need health. And if every hit is a crit, I don't need Strength.\"\n\n\"Wait, what are you doing?\" Fizz asked, her asterisks-eyes widening.\n\nArtie grabbed the Critical Hit Affinity slider and slammed it to the far right. He didn't just spend the 50 points; he started draining the other stats to pay for the overflow. The UI began to flicker. Warning lights flashed red.\n\n[WARNING: Stat Imbalance Detected]\n[WARNING: Vitality dropping below Recommended Minimum]\n[WARNING: Physical Integrity at Risk]\n\n\"Artie, stop! You\u2019re going to break the avatar before it even spawns!\" Fizz shouted, reaching for the screen.\n\nArtie\u2019s finger hit the [CONFIRM] button just as a massive surge of golden light erupted from the menu. The white void groaned, the sound of grinding gears echoing from the \"Great Login Screen\" itself.\n\n[System Notification: Build Confirmed]\n[New Title Acquired: Statistical Anomaly]\n[New Title Acquired: The Glassest Cannon]\n\n[Final Attributes]\n[Strength: 1]\n[Agility: 1]\n[Intelligence: 1]\n[Vitality: 1]\n[Luck: 99]\n\n[Calculated Combat Stats]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[MP: 1/1]\n[Critical Hit Rate: 100%]\n[Critical Hit Multiplier: 500%]\n\n\"One?\" Fizz whispered, staring at the screen in genuine horror. \"One hit point? Artie, a stiff breeze is a boss fight for you now. If you trip on a pebble, you\u2019re dead. If you sneeze too hard, you\u2019re dead. If a butterfly flaps its wings in the next kingdom over, you are statistically likely to explode!\"\n\nArtie felt... light. Dangerously light. He looked at his hands; they were slightly translucent around the edges. He gripped the Broken Tutorial Sword, and for the first time, he saw a faint, golden glow pulsing along the jagged edge.\n\n\"I won't trip,\" Artie said, though his knees felt a bit wobbly with a Strength stat of one. \"And I won't sneeze. I\u2019m going to crit this world until it gives me my change back.\"\n\n\"You\u2019re an idiot,\" Fizz said, but she was already typing furiously on her Data Slate. \"Fine. It\u2019s your funeral.

Artie felt a sudden, violent pull at his navel. He clutched his broken sword in his right hand and the single copper coin in his pocket, bracing for a world where he was exactly one mistake away from 'TERMINATED.'\n\n\"See you on the other side, Fizz,\" Artie called out.\n\n\"I\u2019ll bring a shovel!\" she yelled back.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"CHAR_FIZZ\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"The System Void\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie met his System Liaison, Fizz.\",\n      \"Fizz mocked Artie's cause of death using a System Death Report.\",\n      \"Artie intentionally dumped all his attribute points into Luck/Crit Affinity.\",\n      \"The System warned Artie about the extreme stat imbalance.\",\n      \"Artie confirmed a build that leaves him with 1 HP and 100% Critical Hit rate.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"character_stat_updates\": {\n    \"CHAR_ARTIE\": {\n      \"strength\": { \"set\": 1 },\n      \"agility\": { \"set\": 1 },\n      \"intelligence\": { \"set\": 1 },\n      \"vitality\": { \"set\": 1 },\n      \"luck\": { \"set\": 99 },\n      \"hp\": { \"set\": 1 },\n      \"hp_max\": { \"set\": 1 },\n      \"mp\": { \"set\": 1 },\n      \"mp_max\": { \"set\": 1 },\n      \"crit_rate\": { \"set\": 100 },\n      \"crit_mult\": { \"set\": 500 }\n    }\n  },\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 2,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        { \"item\": \"Broken Tutorial Sword\", \"container\": \"hand_right\", \"status\": \"carried\" },\n        { \"item\": \"Linen Tunic\", \"container\": \"body\", \"status\": \"equipped\" },\n        { \"item\": \"Single Copper Coin\", \"container\": \"pockets\", \"status\": \"stowed\" }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        { \"container\": \"hand_right\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"contents\": [\"Broken Tutorial Sword\"] },\n        { \"container\": \"pockets\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"contents\": [\"Single Copper Coin\"] }\n      ],\n      \"invariants_add\": [\n        \"stat: hp = 1\",\n        \"stat: crit_rate = 100%\",\n        \"title: Statistical Anomaly\",\n        \"title: The Glassest Cannon\"\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie values optimization over safety.\",\n        \"Artie is determined to 'beat' the system's math.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_FIZZ\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 2,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        { \"item\": \"Data Slate\", \"container\": \"hand_left\", \"status\": \"carried\" }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        { \"container\": \"hand_left\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_FIZZ\", \"contents\": [\"Data Slate\"] }\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Fizz is cynical and expects Artie to fail quickly.\",\n        \"Fizz uses her Data Slate to track System logs and mock users.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie met his guide, Fizz, in the System Void and was presented with his character creation menu.\",\n      \"Despite Fizz's warnings, Artie dumped all his points into Critical Hit Affinity to achieve a 100% crit rate.\",\n      \"The resulting build left Artie with only 1 HP, making him the ultimate 'Glass Cannon'.\",\n      \"The System confirmed the build and began deploying Artie to the first tutorial zone.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Artie confronted Fizz about his embarrassing death report.\",\n      \"The character creation UI was initialized with 50 available points.\",\n      \"Artie discovered the 'Critical Hit Affinity' slider in the advanced menu.\",\n      \"Artie ignored System warnings to max out his Luck at the expense of all other stats.\",\n      \"Artie acquired the titles 'Statistical Anomaly' and 'The Glassest Cannon'.\",\n      \"The deployment sequence to 'The Whispering Woods' was initiated.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"milestone: artie_died = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: system_login = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: build_confirmed = DONE\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Broken Tutorial Sword (carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Single Copper Coin (stowed, container=pockets)\",\n      \"stat: hp = 1\",\n      \"stat: crit_rate = 100%\",\n      \"location: The System Void (transitioning to Whispering Woods)\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Artie has sacrificed his physical durability for a guaranteed critical hit rate, entering the game world as a 1 HP anomaly.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"threads_touched\": [\n    \"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"\n  ]\n}",

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nMechanics contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and labels (stats/skills) must be sourced from state or explicitly updated in the state_patch. Do not invent numbers or canonical tokens.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head.

At my current Strength of 12, with a base weapon damage of 4-6, I was looking at a nine-hit kill minimum, assuming the RNG gods didn't decide to spit on my shoes today. \n\n\"You know,\" I said, adjusting my grip on the rusted shortsword. \"In most worlds, puddles are for stepping in, not for getting dissolved by.\"\n\nThe slime responded by launching a glob of corrosive mucus. I rolled left, the grass staining my knees.\n\n[Stamina: 88/100]\n\n\"Missed me. Barely. That\u2019s a three-second cooldown on your spit, isn't it?\"\n\nI didn't wait for the confirmation. I lunged.
