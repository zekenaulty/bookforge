Weave a narrative rich with subtle foreshadowing and intricate plot threads, ensuring that major reveals feel earned and are judiciously hinted at throughout the text. Maintain a mythic and epic tone through descriptive language and thematic depth. Develop complex, morally ambiguous characters alongside clear heroes and villains, exploring their internal conflicts and motivations. Integrate world-building seamlessly, avoiding direct info-dumps. Vary sentence structure and pacing, using longer, flowing sentences for description and shorter, impactful ones for tension and revelation. Avoid deus ex machina, predictable character arcs, and simplistic moral resolutions. Focus on creating a layered reading experience where the importance of minor details becomes clear in surprising, satisfying ways, rewarding attentive readers.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\n",

It was a rhythmic, low-frequency thrum that set the silver vials in her bandolier rattling against her chest. She pressed her palm flat against the damp earth of the Whispering Woods, feeling the moss shudder. This wasn't the tectonic shift of a tremor, nor the heavy footfalls of a forest drake. It was something deliberate. Something old.\n\nAcross the valley, the bells of Oakhaven continued their frantic, rhythmic mourning, signaling the lockdown. Lyra ignored them. The citadel\u2019s problems rarely reached the forest floor, but the energy surging through the ley-lines beneath her boots was a more immediate concern. \n\n\"Steady,\" she whispered to herself, her voice a dry rasp. She adjusted the strap of her recurve bow, her fingers tracing the notched wood. \n\nThe air itself seemed to hum with an ancient, resonant cold, a quality not of temperature but of time, thick with the dust of epochs. Stone, scarred by winds that had scoured centuries, loomed ahead\u2014the jagged remains of the Aethelgard Watch. Normally, the ruins were dead, nothing more than a graveyard for forgotten kings and the occasional nest of shadow-wasps. But tonight, the stones were bleeding light. A pale, cyanotic glow leaked from the cracks in the masonry, pulsing in time with the thrum in her teeth.\n\nLyra\u2019s survival instincts, honed by three years of scavenging the borderlands, screamed at her to retreat. The Whispering Woods were treacherous enough in the dark without the added variable of a magical flare-up. Prudence dictated a five-mile detour toward the southern marshes. But her pragmatism\u2014the part of her that remembered the empty grain-bins in her cellar and the dwindling charge in her hearth-stones\u2014held her steady. An energy surge of this magnitude usually meant a breach, and a breach meant artifacts.\n\nShe crept forward, her boots making no sound on the decaying leaf litter. As she crested a small rise, she saw the source. The ruins weren't just glowing; they were breathing. A ripple of distortion, like heat haze on a summer road, shimmered around the central archway. \n\nThe fluctuations were erratic. One moment, the ambient mana was a stagnant pool; the next, it was a rushing torrent that made the hair on her arms stand on end. She pulled a brass lens from her pocket\u2014a rusted surveyor\u2019s tool she\u2019d modified with a sliver of refined quartz. Looking through it, the world turned a bruised purple, revealing the jagged lines of force. They weren't dissipating. They were being pulled.\n\nSomething\u2014or someone\u2014was acting as a vacuum for the local resonance.\n\n\"Too much noise for a simple relic,\" she muttered, her eyes narrowing. \n\nIf the High Guard\u2019s hounds were already out in response to the bells, they\u2019d see this beacon from miles away. If she was going to scavenge anything, she had a window of minutes, not hours. She checked her dagger, ensuring the hilt was clear of her cloak. \n\nThe conflict gnawed at her. To enter the Aethelgard ruins during a surge was to risk being unmade by the very air, or worse, trapped in a temporal pocket. Yet, the specific frequency of the vibration\u2014that rhythmic, silver-sharp beat\u2014tugged at a memory she couldn't quite place. It felt like a call. It felt like an invitation written in a language her blood understood even if her mind did not.\n\nA sudden, sharp crack echoed through the trees\u2014not the sound of a branch breaking, but the crystalline snap of a magical ward failing. The glow in the ruins intensified, turning from a soft cyan to a blinding, violent white. \n\nLyra shielded her eyes, her heart hammering against her ribs. The pragmatist in her lost the argument. If she stayed on the periphery, she was just a witness to her own poverty. If she moved, she was a player. \n\nShe stood, shaking the tension from her legs. She didn't head for the safety of the deep woods. Instead, she adjusted her pack, checked the tension on her bowstring one last time, and began a low, crouched run toward the shimmering maw of the ruins. The cold intensified as she drew closer, the scent of ozone and ancient stone filling her lungs. Whatever was waking up in the heart of the Aethelgard, she would be the first to claim it.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n    \"chapter\": 1,\n    \"scene\": 3\n  },\n  \"duplication_warnings_in_row\": 0,\n  \"plan\": {\n    \"outline_path\": \"outline/outline.json\",\n    \"scene_card\": \"draft/chapters/ch_001/scene_003.meta.json\"\n  },\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"status\": \"DRAFTING\",\n  \"world\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [],\n    \"location\": \"\",\n    \"open_threads\": [],\n    \"recent_facts\": [],\n    \"time\": {}\n  }\n}\n\nInvariants:\n[\n  \"No world resets.\",\n  \"No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\",\n  \"Do not change established names/relationships.\"\n]\n"
