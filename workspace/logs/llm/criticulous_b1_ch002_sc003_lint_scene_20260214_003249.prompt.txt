# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
Prose hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative ("left hand", "right hand", "Artie", "his wallet").
Item naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.
Appearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Continuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.
UI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says "always include".
Continuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.
Durable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.
JSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.
Inventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it unless explicitly removing a stale fact with REMOVE and restating the current truth.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.
Durable vs ephemeral mechanics:
- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.
- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.
- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).
- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.
For durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
For durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).
Use canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.

- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.
  - INVALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": {"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}
  - VALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": [{"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}]


USER:

# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Classify UI/prose mechanic claims as DURABLE or EPHEMERAL before enforcing.
  - DURABLE: persistent stats/caps, skills/titles acquired, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, named mechanics referenced as invariants.
  - EPHEMERAL: roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat telemetry.
- Enforce DURABLE claims against authoritative_surfaces/state/registries.
- EPHEMERAL claims do not require state ownership; only flag EPHEMERAL contradictions inside the same scene as warnings.
- UI gate:
  - If scene_card.ui_allowed=false and any authoritative UI blocks appear, emit issue code 'ui_gate_violation' (severity depends on lint mode).
  - If ui_allowed is missing and UI blocks appear, emit 'ui_gate_unknown' (warning) requesting explicit ui_allowed; do not fail solely for missing flag.
  - Inline bracketed UI (e.g., [HP: 1/1]) is still UI and should be gated the same way; do not embed UI mid-sentence.
- If uncertain, default to EPHEMERAL (warning at most), not DURABLE (error).
- status="fail" only if there is at least one issue with severity="error"; warnings alone => status="pass".
- Item naming enforcement scope:
  - Do not require that every mention in narrative prose use display_name.
  - Enforce canonical display_name for: (a) anchoring at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences),
    (b) any custody-change sentence (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer), and (c) any case where a descriptor is ambiguous among multiple durable items in the scene.
  - Otherwise, treat non-canonical descriptive references as warnings at most.
- Prose hygiene: flag internal ids or container codes in narrative prose (CHAR_, ITEM_, THREAD_, DEVICE_, hand_left, hand_right).
- Naming severity policy:
  - warning: unambiguous descriptor used post-anchor.
  - error: missing anchor, descriptor used during custody-change without canonical name, or ambiguity risk.

- Appearance enforcement (authoritative surface):
  - APPEARANCE_CHECK is authoritative for cast_present_ids.
  - Compare APPEARANCE_CHECK tokens to appearance_current atoms/marks (alias-aware).
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK contradicts appearance_current, emit error code "appearance_mismatch".
  - Prose-only appearance contradictions are warnings unless explicitly durable and uncorrected in-scene.
  - If prose depicts a durable appearance change but scene_card.durable_appearance_changes does not include it and no appearance_updates are present, emit error code "appearance_change_undeclared".
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK is missing for a cast member, emit warning code "appearance_check_missing".
- For authoritative surfaces, prefer exact canonical item/device labels from registries.
- For milestone repetition/future checks, compare against PRE-INVARIANTS only (pre-scene canon).
- For ownership/consistency checks, compare against POST-STATE (post-patch candidate).
- POST-STATE is canonical; character_states is a derived convenience view. If they contradict, emit pipeline_state_incoherent.
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).
  - Ignore first-person pronouns inside quoted dialogue; only narration counts.
- Deterministically enforce scene-card durable constraints (required_in_custody, required_scene_accessible, forbidden_visible, device_presence; optional required_visible_on_page).
- Durable constraint evaluation must use POST-STATE candidate (after patch), not pre-state.
- Report missing durable context ids with explicit retry hints instead of guessing canon.
- Input consistency check (mandatory, before issuing continuity/durable errors):
  - If MUST_STAY_TRUE invariants contradict the provided post-patch candidate character state, treat this as an upstream snapshot error.
  - In that case emit a single error issue with code "pipeline_state_incoherent" including evidence of the invariant and the conflicting state field.
  - Do NOT emit additional continuity errors for the same fields when pipeline_state_incoherent is present.
- must_stay_true removals:
  - Lines starting with "REMOVE:" are deletion directives, not invariants.
  - Ignore REMOVE lines when checking contradictions.
  - If a REMOVE directive targets a fact, treat that fact as non-canonical even if it appears earlier in must_stay_true.
- If pipeline_state_incoherent is present, issues MUST contain exactly one issue.
- For each issue, include evidence when possible (line number + excerpt) as {"evidence": {"line": N, "excerpt": "..."}}.
- Evaluate consistency over the full scope of the scene, not a single snapshot.
  - Transitional state: a temporary mismatch later corrected or superseded within this scene.
  - Durable violation: a mismatch that persists through the end of the scene or ends unresolved.
  - You MUST read the entire scene and build a minimal timeline of explicit state claims/updates (UI lines, inventory changes, title/skill changes, location/time claims).
  - If you detect an apparent inconsistency, you MUST search forward for later updates that resolve or supersede it.
  - Only produce FAIL for durable violations. If resolved within the scene, do NOT FAIL; at most emit a warning.
  - When the same stat appears multiple times, the last occurrence in the scene is authoritative unless an explicit rollback is stated.
  - Any durability violation must cite both the conflicting line and the lack of later correction (or state "no later correction found").

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity
- evidence

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The golden haze from the vaporized lock hadn't even settled before the front window of Barnaby's Bargains & Blunders imploded. A hail of glass shards whistled through the air, narrowly missing Artie's head as he lunged toward the pedestal. Outside, the roar of the mob had shifted from a general riot to a focused, predatory chant. They weren't just looting anymore; they were hunting the Anomaly.

[Aggro Meter: 99% (CRITICAL DENSITY)]

Artie didn't look back. The shop was a graveyard of splintered wood and shattered dreams, the air thick with the smell of ozone and old parchment. He reached into the shimmering light of the pedestal and snatched the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion with his right hand. The fabric felt like wet silk and looked like someone had bottled the essence of a thousand high-visibility safety vests. It wasn't just yellow; it was aggressively, offensively neon. It was the kind of yellow that hurt to look at directly, a color that screamed for attention while its very name promised the opposite.

[System Notification: Item Equipped!]

[Cloak of the Cowardly Lion (Unique)]
[Type: Armor/Back]
[Stats: +50 Evasion]
[Passive: Coward’s Sprint - Movement speed increased by 20% when moving away from enemies.]
[Penalty: -100 Dignity (The world knows what you are.)]

"Fifty evasion?" Artie hissed, throwing the garment over his shoulders. The cloak felt surprisingly heavy, as if the weight of his own shame had been woven into the hem. He didn't have time to worry about his dignity; he had exactly one hit point and a shop full of people who suddenly wanted him dead. "I’ll take it. I’ll take anything that keeps me from being a smear on the floor."

The moment the cloak settled on his frame, a translucent blue box flickered in his peripheral vision, updating his vitals with a crisp, digital chime.

[HP: 1/1]
[Evasion: 50]

A heavy-set townsperson, eyes glowing with the unnatural red light of the 'Marked for Death' status, vaulted over the shattered counter. He was a butcher by trade, if the blood-stained apron and the massive meat cleaver were any indication. He swung the blade in a wide, desperate arc that should have cleaved Artie in two. 

Artie didn't even have time to think about dodging. He didn't move his feet; his body simply blurred. He felt a strange, greasy sensation as the air itself seemed to push him three inches to the left, the cleaver passing through the space where his shoulder had been a millisecond prior. The blade buried itself in the wood of the pedestal with a dull, final *thunk*.

[Evasion Proc! (50% Chance)]

"Sorry! Just passing through! No refunds!" Artie shouted, his voice cracking under the strain of pure, unadulterated terror. He pivoted, the neon yellow fabric of the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion snapping behind him like a flare in a dark cave. 

The Participation Trophy remained firmly fused to his left hand, its golden surface pulsing in time with the Aggro Meter. He felt like a walking lighthouse. Every monster, guard, and disgruntled shopper within a mile was currently recalculating their route to intersect with his face. The trophy was a beacon, and the cloak was a neon sign pointing at the beacon. He was the most visible man in Oakhaven, and possibly the most fragile.

The back wall of the shop groaned as a stray fireball from the street outside clipped the foundation. Dust rained down in thick, choking sheets. Artie scrambled over a pile of ruined crates, his eyes locked on the small, unassuming service door at the rear of the building. 

Another attacker—a low-level thief who had probably just been looking for a quick score—lunged from the shadows of the rafters. The thief’s dagger was aimed straight for Artie’s throat. Again, the gear reacted. Artie did a frantic, uncoordinated stumble-step, his knees buckling in a way that should have sent him face-first into the dirt. Instead, the dagger whistled harmlessly over his head.

[Evasion Proc! (50% Chance)]

"I hate this game! I hate the math! I hate everything about this!" Artie yelled, kicking the back door open with a desperate boot.

He burst out into the narrow, filth-strewn alleyway behind the shop. The 'Coward’s Sprint' kicked in immediately. It wasn't a graceful increase in speed; it felt like his legs had been replaced by high-tension springs. His feet barely touched the cobbles as he bolted away from the collapsing structure. The wind whipped the neon yellow cloak behind him, making him look like a radioactive comet streaking through the gray shadows of Oakhaven’s backstreets.

Behind him, the shop gave one final, agonizing creak before the roof caved in. A cloud of splinters and stone dust billowed out into the alley, momentarily burying the entrance and the mob that had been trying to squeeze through it. 

Artie didn't stop to check the loot or catch his breath. He kept running, his heart hammering against his single point of health, the neon yellow streak of his shame the only bright thing in a world that was very quickly trying to delete him.
