PROSE:

The transition from the digital void to the Whispering Woods felt less like a magical teleportation and more like being shoved out of a moving car into a pile of damp laundry. Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon hit the forest floor with a thud that vibrated through his very soul—or whatever was left of it after the System finished digitizing his existence.

[Location: Whispering Woods (Tutorial Zone)]
[Environmental Status: Damp, Slightly Spooky, 100% Chance of Death]

"Welcome to the world of tomorrow, Artie! Try not to bleed on the grass; it’s a nightmare to get out of the textures," Fizz chirped. 

She was hovering a few feet above the moss, looking entirely too refreshed for someone who had just witnessed a man commit statistical suicide. She flipped through The Official System Guidebook, the pages crackling with a faint blue light.

Artie groaned, pushing himself up. His palms came away smeared with green slime and dirt. He looked down at his Standard Issue Jumpsuit. It was a grey, mesh-like fabric that offered all the defensive properties of a wet paper towel. 

"I feel... light," Artie muttered. "And not the 'I lost ten pounds' light. More like the 'I am made of glass and hope' light."

"That’s because you are," Fizz said, pointing a translucent finger at the air above his head. "Check your HUD. I think the System is still trying to decide if you’re a player or a very specific type of error message."

Artie looked up. The floating red bar was there, mocking him.

[HP: 1/1] (locked)

"One," Artie whispered. "It really is just one."

"On the bright side, you don't have to worry about complicated math during combat," Fizz offered, her wings buzzing with manic energy. "If a number bigger than zero touches you, you're a loot drop. It’s very binary. Very elegant."

A wet, squelching sound echoed through the clearing. It sounded like someone dropping a gallon of mayonnaise into a bathtub. Artie froze. To his left, a bush shuddered, and a translucent, lime-green blob wobbled into the light. It was about the size of a beach ball and looked suspiciously like it was made of industrial-strength dish soap.

[Lesser Forest Slime - Lvl 1]
[HP: 15/15]

"Oh, look! Your first tutorial mob," Fizz said, floating back to a safe distance. "Usually, players use these to test their basic attacks and maybe take a few hits to see how their armor feels. You... well, you might want to skip the 'taking hits' part."

The slime didn't have eyes, but it definitely had intent. It vibrated, its entire body rippling with a rhythmic, hungry intensity. It began to slide across the moss toward Artie. It wasn't fast, but it was persistent.

"Okay," Artie said, backing away. "It’s a slime. I’ve played games. You just... you hit it, right? I have 100% Crit Rate. I should be able to just poke it and it explodes."

[Crit Rate: 100%] (locked)

"Theoretically, yes," Fizz called out. "But remember, Artie, you have the Agility of a sedentary office chair. And that slime? It’s Level 1, but it’s still faster than a spreadsheet."

Artie stepped back again, his heel catching on a gnarled root. He stumbled, his heart hammering against his ribs—a frantic, 1-HP drumbeat. The slime surged forward, a glob of its acidic body stretching out like a questing tongue. It sizzled as it touched a patch of grass near Artie’s foot, turning the green blades into a blackened, smoking slurry.

[Warning: Corrosive Contact Detected]
[Estimated Damage: 2-4 HP per second]

"Two to four?" Artie’s voice went up an octave. "I only have one! That’s a 400% overkill!"

"The System loves a good rounding error," Fizz said, appearing to take notes in her manual.

Artie scrambled backward, his hands searching for a weapon, a rock, a particularly sturdy stick—anything. But the Whispering Woods were suspiciously clean of debris. The slime lunged again, a slow-motion leap that felt like a falling mountain of jelly. Artie twisted out of the way, the Standard Issue Jumpsuit brushing against a low-hanging branch.

[Stamina: 95/100]

He was breathing hard now. Every movement felt heavy, every step a gamble. He could see the individual bubbles trapped inside the slime’s body. It was close enough that he could smell it—a cloying, chemical scent like an over-cleaned hospital hallway.

He backed up one more step and his shoulder blades hit something hard and unforgiving. He glanced back. A massive, ancient oak tree blocked his path. Its bark was rough and indifferent to his plight.

He was trapped.

The slime stopped its slide a few feet away. It began to compress itself, drawing its gelatinous mass inward like a coiled spring. It was preparing to launch.

"Fizz?" Artie gulped.

"Yes, Artie?"

"If I die in the tutorial, do I get a refund on my life?"

"Checking..." Fizz flipped a page. "Nope. But you do get a very colorful 'Game Over' screen. I hear the music is quite catchy."

The slime vibrated one last time, a high-pitched hum that made Artie's teeth ache. He pressed his back against the tree, his eyes wide, realizing that in this world, 'Level 1' didn't mean 'Easy.' It meant 'Lethal.' 

The slime launched.
