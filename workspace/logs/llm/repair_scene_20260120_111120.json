  "text": "PROSE:\nThe bridge didn't just lean; it groaned with the slow, tectonic agony of granite being forced into a geometry it wasn't carved for. Kaelen pressed his chest against the cold stone of the transit-arch, his boots skidding on a fine dusting of pulverized mortar. Gravity pulled him toward the eastern precipice, where the clouds were stained a bruised, sickly violet. The High Spire, once the vertical axis of the world\u2019s stability, was now a falling needle frozen in mid-descent.\n\nInside his right forearm, the pewter filament of his Starwrought Oath ground against the marrow of his radius bone. It was a jagged, physical sensation, a metallic splintering that made his teeth ache. Every time the Spire lurched, the filament vibrated, sending a needle of cold fire through his arm. The black, starwrought scarring on his skin followed the path of the metal beneath, a map of obsidian veins that felt slick and hard as beetle-chitin.\n\nThe weight in his satchel\u2014the physical shard he had claimed from the crater\u2014pulsed with a rhythmic, alien beat. *Thump-hiss. Thump-hiss.* It was no longer a separate sound; it was the cadence of his own heart. The resonance traveled through the strap of the bag, into his shoulder, and down to the pewter filament in his bone, synchronizing his biology with the star\u2019s dying breath.\n\nHe reached the end of the bridge and hauled himself onto the main terrace. The air here was thick with the scent of scorched copper and something sweeter, like rotting fruit. It made his lungs ache, a dry, brittle sensation that forced him to take shallow, guarded breaths. The very atmosphere of the Spire was being replaced by the starfall\u2019s corruption.\n\n\"Varkas!\" he shouted, but the wind swallowed the name. \n\nThe main gates of the High Spire were gone. Not broken or forced, but unmade. The heavy ironwood had been reduced to a fine gray ash that swirled in the draft, and the stone lintel was weeping a viscous, violet fluid. Kaelen stepped over the threshold, his hand instinctively moving to the hilt of his blade. His right arm felt heavy, the pewter filament within it dragging like a lead weight as the shard in his satchel intensified its pull.\n\nThe interior of the Spire was a graveyard of silence. The great hall, which usually hummed with the low-frequency resonance of the protective wards, was hollow. The silver filigree that once lined the walls was now black and jagged, protruding from the masonry like the teeth of a saw. The wards hadn't just failed; they had been inverted, turned into a cage for whatever was now dwelling within.\n\nHe moved toward the central staircase, his shadow stretching long and distorted across the floor. The tilt of the building was more pronounced here, perhaps fifteen degrees off-center. Every dozen steps, the floor would lurch, a groan of stressed stone echoing up from the foundations. The Spire was dying, its soul being eaten by the very thing it was built to watch.\n\nAs he ascended toward the Inner Sanctum, the violet light grew more intense. It didn't come from any lamp or window; it bled from the air itself, a nebulous haze that made the edges of the world seem soft and frayed. The stone steps under his feet felt spongy, as if the molecular bond of the granite was dissolving into the same violet 'Star-Bleed' he had seen at the gates.\n\nHe reached the landing of the third floor and stopped. A trail of the violet fluid ran down the center of the hallway, steaming slightly. It led directly to the Commander\u2019s private chambers.\n\n\"Commander?\" Kaelen\u2019s voice was a rasp. The cold in his arm was spreading, a numbing frost that threatened to lock his elbow. He gripped his right wrist with his left hand, feeling the hard ridges of the starwrought scarring. He could feel the pewter filament vibrating violently now, reacting to something inside the room.\n\nThe door to the Inner Sanctum was ajar. It hung on a single hinge, the wood charred and weeping. Kaelen shouldered it open, the screech of metal on stone sounding like a dying bird.\n\nThe room beyond was a chaotic tableau of scholarship and ruin. Varkas\u2019s maps, centuries of star-charts and planetary alignments, were scattered across the floor, their parchment curling and blackening as if exposed to an invisible flame. The great orrery in the center of the room\u2014a masterpiece of brass and celestial glass\u2014was shattered. Its gears were scattered like copper coins, and the central sun-globe was missing.\n\nIn the center of the ruin sat Commander Varkas.\n\nHe was slumped in his high-backed chair, his back to the door. He didn't turn when Kaelen entered. He didn't move at all, save for the rhythmic rise and fall of his shoulders. \n\n\"Commander, the Spire is falling,\" Kaelen said, his voice gaining a desperate edge. \"The wards are gone. I have the shard. We have to move.\"\n\nVarkas didn't answer. Instead, he let out a sound\u2014a low, melodic hum that vibrated in Kaelen\u2019s marrow, causing the pewter filament in his arm to shiver in sympathetic resonance. It was the same frequency as the shard in the satchel. \n\nKaelen walked around the chair, his heart hammering against his ribs in that same *thump-hiss* rhythm. \"Varkas, look at me.\"\n\nHe reached out with his left hand and turned the chair. \n\nThe man who had been Commander Varkas was gone. In his place was a vessel of the starfall. Varkas\u2019s eyes were no longer white and iris; they were twin pools of rotating violet light, deep and vast as the void itself. His skin was translucent, stretched thin over bones that had turned the color of bruised pewter. \n\nBut it was the Commander's chest that made Kaelen recoil. \n\nThe front of Varkas\u2019s tunic had been torn away. Where his heart should have been, a jagged cluster of star-glass had erupted from the ribcage. It pulsed with a rhythmic, alien beat, and from its center, thin filaments of violet energy crawled up Varkas\u2019s neck like a web of glowing veins. \n\n\"Kaelen,\" Varkas whispered. The voice didn't come from his throat; it seemed to vibrate out of the very air between them. It was a hollow, echoing sound, stripped of all humanity. \"The oath... is a lie.\"\n\nVarkas raised a hand. It was no longer a hand. The fingers had elongated, the tips sharpening into translucent needles of glass. He reached toward Kaelen, his movements jerky and unnatural, like a marionette being pulled by invisible, frantic strings. \n\n\"The stars aren't watching us, Kaelen,\" Varkas said, a single tear of violet fluid tracing a path down his cheek. \"They are waiting for us.\"\n\nKaelen stepped back, his boot catching on a fallen brass gear. The physical shard in his satchel let out a violent *thump-hiss*, and the black scarring on his arm flared with a blinding, frigid light. The two resonances\u2014the one in Kaelen\u2019s satchel and the one in the Commander\u2019s chest\u2014clashed in the small room, shattering the remaining glass in the orrery.\n\n\"Commander, please,\" Kaelen choked out, the scorched-copper smell becoming unbearable. \n\nVarkas stood up. He was taller than he should have been, his spine elongating with the sound of snapping bone. The star-glass in his chest brightened, casting long, jagged shadows against the tilting walls of the sanctum. \n\n\"The Order was a cage,\" Varkas said, his violet eyes locking onto Kaelen\u2019s. \"And the star... is the key.\"\n\nHe took a step forward, the floorboards splintering under his weight. The High Spire gave a massive, final groan, the tilt increasing until the furniture began to slide toward the eastern wall. Kaelen grabbed a bookshelf to steady himself, his eyes never leaving the horror that had been his mentor. \n\nThe corruption wasn't just physical; it was an erasure. Varkas was being hollowed out, replaced by the very essence they had sworn their lives to contain. \n\n\"I have the maps,\" Kaelen said, his voice trembling. \"I have the shard. I can fix this.\"\n\nVarkas smiled, a terrifying expression that split his translucent skin. \"You can't fix a sunrise, Kaelen. You can only witness it.\"\n\nThe Commander raised his glass-tipped hand, and the violet light in the room intensified until it was all Kaelen could see. The *thump-hiss* in his chest reached a deafening crescendo, a scream of alien energy that threatened to tear his heart in two. \n\nThe High Spire screamed with him, a chorus of stone and metal reaching its breaking point.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\n      \"CHAR_kaelen\",\n      \"CHAR_commander_varkas\"\n    ],\n    \"location\": \"High Spire - Inner Sanctum\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Kaelen found Commander Varkas physically transformed and corrupted by star-glass.\",\n      \"Varkas claims the Starwrought Oath is a lie and the Order was a cage.\",\n      \"The High Spire is in the final stages of structural failure and tilting heavily.\",\n      \"Kaelen's physical pewter Oath-filament is reacting violently to Varkas's presence.\",\n      \"The star-shard remains in Kaelen's satchel, though its resonance is synchronized with his heart.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\n      \"THREAD_oath_binding\",\n      \"THREAD_starfall_corruption\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Kaelen navigated the collapsing High Spire to reach the Inner Sanctum.\",\n      \"He discovered Commander Varkas has been consumed by the starfall, with star-glass erupting from his chest.\",\n      \"Varkas revealed a nihilistic view of the Order's mission before the Spire's structural failure reached a tipping point.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Kaelen felt the pewter filament of his Oath grinding in his radius bone as he navigated the tilting Spire.\",\n      \"The physical star-shard in Kaelen's satchel synchronized its 'thump-hiss' pulse with his heartbeat.\",\n      \"Kaelen observed the 'Star-Bleed' violet fluid dissolving the Spire's architecture.\",\n      \"Commander Varkas was found corrupted, his eyes turned to violet voids and his heart replaced by star-glass.\",\n      \"Varkas declared the Oath a lie and the stars as a waiting threat rather than a watched one.\",\n      \"A resonance clash occurred between Kaelen's shard and Varkas's corruption, shattering the room's glass.\",\n      \"The High Spire began its final collapse as Varkas confronted Kaelen.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"The Starwrought Oath is a physical pewter filament woven into the radius bone.\",\n      \"The star-shard is a physical object carried in Kaelen's satchel.\",\n      \"Magic and star-matter proximity cause physical frost-burn, scorched lungs, and metallic scents.\",\n      \"Kaelen's right arm bears black, starwrought scarring following the path of the Oath-filament.\",\n      \"The starfall corruption manifests as violet light, 'Star-Bleed' fluid, and a 'thump-hiss' resonance.\",\n      \"The High Spire is tilting and undergoing catastrophic structural failure.\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Kaelen returned to the High Spire only to find his commander, Varkas, fully corrupted by the starfall.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",

Your writing is characterized by a tight, limited third-person perspective that never breaks into omniscient narration. You must maintain strict continuity, ensuring that characters utilize their full range of established skills and knowledge. Do not use 'As you know' dialogue or provide summaries of previous events. When a scene begins, drop the reader directly into the character's current sensory experience. Avoid clich\u00e9s in descriptions; instead of 'cold as ice,' describe the 'brittle, biting snap of air that makes the lungs ache.' Ensure all plot payoffs are seeded with subtle clues in earlier movements. Magic and high-fantasy elements must have clear costs and logical consistency.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"The Silver Fracture\",\"goal\":\"Witness the starfall and establish Kaelen's failing

carved for. Kaelen pressed his chest against the cold stone of the transit-arch, his boots skidding on a fine dusting of pulverized mortar. Gravity pulled him toward the eastern precipice, where the clouds were stained a bruised, sickly violet. The High Spire, once the vertical axis of the world\u2019s stability, was now a falling needle frozen in mid-descent.\n\nInside his ribs, his heart no longer belonged to him. It beat with a double-time cadence\u2014*thump-hiss, thump-hiss*\u2014an echo of the weight in his satchel. Every pulse sent a needle of cold fire down his right arm, where the black, starwrought scarring had begun to knit itself into his very muscle. The skin there was no longer flesh; it was a map of obsidian veins, slick and hard as beetle-chitin, pulsing in time with the shard. \n\nHe reached the end of the bridge and hauled himself onto the main terrace. The air here was thick with the scent of scorched copper and something sweeter, like rotting fruit. It made his lungs ache, a dry, brittle sensation that forced him to take shallow, guarded breaths. \n\n\"Varkas!\" he shouted, but the wind swallowed the name. \n\nThe main gates of the High Spire were gone. Not broken or forced, but unmade. The heavy ironwood had been reduced to a fine gray ash that swirled in the draft, and the stone lintel was weeping a viscous, violet fluid. Kaelen stepped over the threshold, his hand instinctively moving to the hilt of his blade, only to find his fingers stiff and clumsy. The starwrought scarring on his arm didn't just hurt; it felt heavy, as if the limb were being replaced by lead.\n\nThe interior of the Spire was a graveyard of silence. The great hall, which usually hummed with the low-frequency resonance of the protective wards, was hollow. The wards hadn't just failed; they had been inverted. The silver filigree that once lined the walls was now black and jagged, protruding from the masonry like the teeth of a saw. \n\nHe moved toward the central staircase, his shadow stretching long and distorted across the floor. The tilt of the building was more pronounced here. Every dozen steps, the floor would lurch, a groan of stressed stone echoing up from the foundations. The Spire was dying, its soul being eaten by the very thing it was built to watch.\n\nHe passed the barracks. The doors were open. He didn't look inside. He couldn't. The smell of ozone was too strong there, and the silence too heavy. He kept his eyes on the path ahead, his boots clicking rhythmically against the stone, a lonely counterpoint to the *thump-hiss* in his chest.\n\nAs he ascended toward the Inner Sanctum, the violet light grew more intense. It didn't come from any lamp or window; it bled from the air itself, a nebulous haze that made the edges of the world seem soft and frayed. The stone steps under his feet felt spongy, as if the molecular bond of the granite was dissolving.\n\nHe reached the landing of the third floor and stopped. A trail of the violet fluid\u2014the 'Star-Bleed'\u2014ran down the center of the hallway, steaming slightly. It led directly to the Commander\u2019s private chambers.\n\n\"Commander?\" Kaelen\u2019s voice was a rasp. The cold in his arm was spreading, a numbing frost that threatened to lock his elbow. He gripped his right wrist with his left hand, forcing the limb to move. \n\nThe door to the Inner Sanctum was ajar. It hung on a single hinge, the wood charred and weeping. Kaelen shouldered it open, the screech of metal on stone sounding like a dying bird.\n\nThe room beyond was a chaotic tableau of scholarship and ruin. Varkas\u2019s maps, centuries of star-charts and planetary alignments, were scattered across the floor, their parchment curling and blackening as if exposed to an invisible flame. The great orrery in the center of the room\u2014a masterpiece of brass and celestial glass\u2014was shattered. Its gears were scattered like copper coins, and the central sun-globe was missing.\n\nIn the center of the ruin sat Commander Varkas.\n\nHe was slumped in his high-backed chair, his back to the door. He didn't turn when Kaelen entered. He didn't move at all, save for the rhythmic rise and fall of his shoulders. \n\n\"Commander, the Spire is falling,\" Kaelen said, his voice gaining a desperate edge. \"The wards are gone. I have the shard. We have to move.\"\n\nVarkas didn't answer. Instead, he let out a sound\u2014a low, melodic hum that vibrated in Kaelen\u2019s marrow. It was the same frequency as the shard in the satchel. \n\nKaelen walked around the chair, his heart hammering against his ribs. \"Varkas, look at me.\"\n\nHe reached out with his left hand and turned the chair. \n\nThe man who had been Commander Varkas was gone. In his place was a vessel of the starfall. Varkas\u2019s eyes were no longer white and iris; they were twin pools of rotating violet light, deep and vast as the void itself. His skin had been translucent, stretched thin over bones that had turned the color of bruised pewter. \n\nBut it was the Commander's chest that made Kaelen recoil. \n\nThe front of Varkas\u2019s tunic had been torn away. Where his heart should have been, a jagged cluster of star-glass had erupted from the ribcage. It pulsed with a rhythmic, alien beat, and from its center, thin filaments of violet energy crawled up Varkas\u2019s neck like a web of glowing veins. \n\n\"Kaelen,\" Varkas whispered. The voice didn't come from his throat; it seemed to vibrate out of the very air between them. It was a hollow, echoing sound, stripped of all humanity. \"The oath... is a lie.\"\n\nVarkas raised a hand. It was no longer a hand. The fingers had elongated, the tips sharpening into translucent needles of glass. He reached toward Kaelen, his movements jerky and unnatural, like a marionette being pulled by invisible, frantic strings. \n\n\"The stars aren't watching us, Kaelen,\" Varkas said, a single tear of violet fluid tracing a path down his cheek. \"They are waiting for us.\"\n\nKaelen stepped back, his boot catching on a fallen brass gear. The shard in his satchel let out a violent *thump-hiss*, and the black scarring on his arm flared with a blinding, frigid light. The two resonances\u2014the one in Kaelen and the one in the Commander\u2014clashed in the small room, shattering the remaining glass in the orrery.\n\n\"Commander, please,\" Kaelen choked out, the scorched-copper smell becoming unbearable. \n\nVarkas stood up. He was taller than he should have been, his spine elongating with the sound of snapping bone. The star-glass in his chest brightened, casting long, jagged shadows against the tilting walls of the sanctum. \n\n\"The Order was a cage,\" Varkas said, his violet eyes locking onto Kaelen\u2019s. \"And the star... is the key.\"\n\nHe took a step forward, the floorboards splintering under his weight. The High Spire gave a massive, final groan, the tilt increasing until the furniture began to slide toward the eastern wall. Kaelen grabbed a bookshelf to steady himself, his eyes never leaving the horror that had been his mentor. \n\nThe corruption wasn't just physical; it was an erasure. Varkas was being hollowed out, replaced by the very essence they had sworn their lives to contain. \n\n\"I have the maps,\" Kaelen said, his voice trembling. \"I have the shard. I can fix this.\"\n\nVarkas smiled, a terrifying expression that split his translucent skin. \"You can't fix a sunrise, Kaelen. You can only witness it.\"\n\nThe Commander raised his glass-tipped hand, and the violet light in the room intensified until it was all Kaelen could see. The *thump-hiss* in his chest reached a deafening crescendo, a scream of alien energy that threatened to tear his heart in two. \n\nThe High Spire screamed with him, a chorus of stone and metal reaching its breaking point.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"cursor\": {\n
