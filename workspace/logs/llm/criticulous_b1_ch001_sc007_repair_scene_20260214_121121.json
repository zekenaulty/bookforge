  "text": "COMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: SC_001_007\nAllowed events: Artie meets Barnaby, Barnaby appraises Artie, dialogue about the Crit economy, Artie realizes he is a target.\nForbidden milestones: Vane rivalry escalation (later scenes), acquisition of evasion gear (Chapter 2).\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: Participation Trophy in hand_right, Corporate ID Badge in lanyard, Smartphone in pocket_left, Leather Wallet in pocket_right.\n\nAPPEARANCE_CHECK:\n- CHAR_ARTIE: slender, mousy brown hair, hazel eyes, pale skin, electrical burns.\n- CHAR_BARNABY: stocky, salt-and-pepper beard, dark brown eyes, weathered skin.\n\nPROSE:\nThe stool groaned under Artie\u2019s weight, a sound that felt dangerously like a physical attack against his remaining health. He didn\u2019t collapse, mostly because collapsing required more stamina than he currently possessed, but he did let his forehead rest against the cool, scarred wood of the bar. \n\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Stamina: 5/100]\n[Status: Exhausted - All physical actions cost 2x Stamina]\n\n\"You look like something a Level 100 Necromancer coughed up,\" a gravelly voice observed.\n\nArtie didn't look up. He just tightened his grip on the Participation Trophy, the cheap gold-painted plastic feeling absurdly heavy in his right hand. The cursed item was still humming with that low-grade \"come kill me\" energy, but inside the walls of Oakhaven, the effect felt muffled, like a radio station losing its signal.\n\n\"I was detained,\" Artie muttered into the wood. \"Administrative review. Apparently, having a heart that beats in binary is a security risk.\"\n\nA heavy thud echoed as a wooden mug was placed in front of him. Artie finally raised his head, blinking his hazel eyes against the dim, amber light of the tavern. Standing behind the bar was a man who looked like he\u2019d been carved out of an old oak stump. Barnaby was short, stocky, and possessed a salt-and-pepper beard so thick it probably had its own defensive stat. He was currently clenching a Wooden Pipe between his teeth, though he wasn't lighting it.\n\n\"The gate guards mentioned a 'Statistical Anomaly' was headed my way,\" Barnaby said, his dark brown eyes scanning Artie with the practiced ease of a man who spent his life looking at price tags. \"They didn't mention you were dressed like a middle-manager who got lost on the way to a spreadsheet convention.\"\n\nArtie glanced down at his chest. The Corporate ID Badge still dangled from the lanyard around his neck, the plastic flickering with a faint, ghostly light. Underneath it, the severe electrical burns from the vending machine accident were hidden by his singed shirt, but the memory of the shock still made his skin crawl.\n\n\"It\u2019s a vintage look,\" Artie said, his voice cracking. \"Very exclusive. Only one in existence, hopefully.\"\n\nBarnaby leaned in, his weathered face inches from Artie\u2019s. He didn't look at Artie\u2019s face; he looked just above his head, squinting at the invisible UI elements that only certain NPCs and high-level players could see.\n\n[Skill Active: Appraisal (Rank B)]\n\n\"One HP,\" Barnaby whispered, the Wooden Pipe nearly falling from his mouth. \"And a Crit Rate of... one hundred percent? Lad, you\u2019re not a player. You\u2019re a walking math error.\"\n\n\"I prefer the term 'optimal build,'\" Artie lied. \n\n\"Optimal?\" Barnaby let out a bark of a laugh that sounded like stones grinding together. \"You\u2019re a glass cannon made of actual glass. One stiff breeze, one misplaced pebble, or one particularly aggressive sneeze from a barmaid and you\u2019re a loot drop. Do you have any idea what you are in this town?\"\n\nArtie took a tentative sip of whatever was in the mug. It tasted like fermented apples and bad math. \n\n[Stamina: +5]\n\n\"A nuisance?\" Artie suggested.\n\n\"A whale,\" Barnaby corrected, his expression turning uncharacteristically serious. \"In Oakhaven, 'Crits' aren't just a combat mechanic. They're the backbone of the local economy. The nobility here? They don't pray for rain or peace. They pray for high rolls. A man who can guarantee a Critical Hit every time he swings a fist? You\u2019re not a hero, Artie. You\u2019re a resource.\"\n\nArtie felt a cold lump form in his stomach that had nothing to do with the cider. He reached into his right pocket, feeling the familiar edges of his Leather Wallet. It was empty of this world's currency, but it felt like a tether to a reality where 'Critical Hits' were just something that happened to other people's cars.\n\n\"I just want a place to hide,\" Artie said. \"Somewhere with a very high ceiling and zero sharp corners.\"\n\nBarnaby sighed, finally lighting his pipe. A cloud of sweet-smelling smoke drifted between them. \"Safety is expensive, lad. And you? You're glowing like a neon sign in a dark alley. That scanner at the gate didn't just flag you for the guards. It logged your stats into the local registry. By tomorrow morning, every 'talent scout' and 'mentor' in the city is going to be looking for the Level 3 glitch with the hundred-percent hit rate.\"\n\nArtie looked at the Participation Trophy in his hand. He\u2019d won it for surviving a slime-pocalypse, but now it felt like a target painted on his back. He thought about his Smartphone in his left pocket, useless and dead, a relic of a world where the only thing he had to worry about was his 401k.\n\n\"So, what you're saying is,\" Artie said, his voice dropping to a whisper, \"I'm basically a winning lottery ticket that can be killed by a papercut.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Barnaby said, tapping his pipe against the bar. \"And in this world, people don't wait for the lottery to draw. They just take the ticket.\"\n\nArtie looked around the tavern. For the first time, the cozy atmosphere felt predatory. The shadows in the corners seemed a little deeper, the eyes of the other patrons a little sharper. He wasn't just a player in a game anymore. He was a glitch in a system that hated being broken, and a prize for anyone strong enough to claim him.\n\n[New Title Progress: One-Hit Wonder (2/10)]\n[Warning: Your presence has been logged by the

    "system": "\ufeff# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nUI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says \"always include\".\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true. If a prior invariant is stale or superseded, you MUST flag it for removal using \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" before restating the current truth.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v2\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\":

        "content": "# REPAIR\n\nFix the scene based on lint issues.\nSummaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\nTimeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: pre-scene invariants and summary facts are binding unless the Scene Card depicts a change. If this scene changes a durable fact, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value and remove the old entry.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n\n- must_stay_true removal (mandatory when a durable fact is superseded):\n  - Add \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" in summary_update.must_stay_true.\n  - Place REMOVE lines before the new final invariant.\n  - REMOVE lines also apply to key_facts_ring (purge stale facts from continuity).\n\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- Inventory posture reconciliation:\n  - If inventory/containers change (held/stowed/container), must_stay_true must be updated to the final posture.\n  - Add REMOVE lines for prior inventory/container invariants before the new final entries.\n  - Use canonical invariant formats:\n    - inventory: CHAR_X -> <item display_name> (status=held|carried|equipped|stowed, container=hand_left|hand_right|<container>)\n    - container: <container> (owner=CHAR_X, contents=[<item display_name>, ...])\nFor held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\nContinuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.\n- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.\n- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.\n- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI gate: only include bracketed UI blocks when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If false, remove or rephrase UI blocks into narrative prose.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or a short parenthetical annotation (e.g., (locked), (Warning: ...)).\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nCanonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\nIf item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for authoritative labels and custody terms.\nUse item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If a durable appearance change occurs in this scene, record it in character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- APPEARANCE_CHECK is required in COMPLIANCE for each cast_present_id (4-8 tokens from atoms/marks).\n\nNaming repairs:\n- If lint flags an item naming issue, fix it with minimal edits.\n- Do not remove humor; simply anchor the item (add display_name near first mention) and ensure custody-change sentences include the display_name.\n- Do not rename item_id or registry fields; only adjust prose wording.\nsummary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\nSTATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\nmust_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\nIf state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\nEnforce scene-card durable constraints: `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\nRespect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`.\n\n- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):\n  - If timeline_scope != \"present\" OR ontological_scope != \"real\", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).\n  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.\n  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category=\"timeline_override\".\n\nReturn corrected prose plus a corrected state_patch JSON block.\n\nOutput format (required, no code fences, no commentary):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n\nAPPEARANCE_CHECK:\n- CHAR_ID: <4-8 tokens from atoms/marks>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects.

Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_device_id, replacement_of.\n  - custodian must be a non-null string id/scope (character id or \"world\"). Never use null.\n    - INVALID: \"custodian\": null\n    - VALID: \"custodian\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\" or \"world\"\n  - owner_scope must be \"character\" or \"world\" and must match the custodian scope.\n  - plot_device_updates: set must include name, custody_scope, custody_ref, activation_state, linked_threads, constraints, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n\n- Transfer vs registry conflict rule (must follow):\n  - If you create a NEW item in item_registry_updates with final custodian already set (e.g., CHAR_ARTIE), DO NOT emit transfer_updates for that item.\n  - If you emit transfer_updates for a NEW item, the registry entry must start with custodian=\"world\" and then transfer to the character.\n  - expected_before must match the registry entry at the moment of transfer (after any registry update that applies before it).  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects;

He didn\u2019t collapse, mostly because collapsing required more stamina than he currently possessed, but he did let his forehead rest against the cool, scarred wood of the bar. \n\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Stamina: 5/100]\n[Status: Exhausted - All physical actions cost 2x Stamina]\n\n\"You look like something a Level 100 Necromancer coughed up,\" a gravelly voice observed.\n\nArtie didn't look up. He just tightened his grip on the Participation Trophy, the cheap gold-painted plastic feeling absurdly heavy in his right hand. The cursed item was still humming with that low-grade \"come kill me\" energy, but inside the walls of Oakhaven, the effect felt muffled, like a radio station losing its signal.\n\n\"I was detained,\" Artie muttered into the wood. \"Administrative review. Apparently, having a heart that beats in binary is a security risk.\"\n\nA heavy thud echoed as a wooden mug was placed in front of him. Artie finally raised his head, blinking his hazel eyes against the dim, amber light of the tavern. Standing behind the bar was a man who looked like he\u2019d been carved out of an old oak stump. Barnaby was short, stocky, and possessed a salt-and-pepper beard so thick it probably had its own defensive stat. He was currently clenching a Wooden Pipe between his teeth, though he wasn't lighting it.\n\n\"The gate guards mentioned a 'Statistical Anomaly' was headed my way,\" Barnaby said, his dark brown eyes scanning Artie with the practiced ease of a man who spent his life looking at price tags. \"They didn't mention you were dressed like a middle-manager who got lost on the way to a spreadsheet convention.\"\n\nArtie glanced down at his chest. The Corporate ID Badge still dangled from the lanyard around his neck, the plastic flickering with a faint, ghostly light. Underneath it, the severe electrical burns from the vending machine accident were hidden by his singed shirt, but the memory of the shock still made his skin crawl.\n\n\"It\u2019s a vintage look,\" Artie said, his voice cracking. \"Very exclusive. Only one in existence, hopefully.\"\n\nBarnaby leaned in, his weathered face inches from Artie\u2019s. He didn't look at Artie\u2019s face; he looked just above his head, squinting at the invisible UI elements that only certain NPCs and high-level players could see.\n\n[Skill Active: Appraisal (Rank B)]\n\n\"One HP,\" Barnaby whispered, the Wooden Pipe nearly falling from his mouth. \"And a Crit Rate of... one hundred percent? Lad, you\u2019re not a player. You\u2019re a walking math error.\"\n\n\"I prefer the term 'optimal build,'\" Artie lied. \n\n\"Optimal?\" Barnaby let out a bark of a laugh that sounded like stones grinding together. \"You\u2019re a glass cannon made of actual glass. One stiff breeze, one misplaced pebble, or one particularly aggressive sneeze from a barmaid and you\u2019re a loot drop. Do you have any idea what you are in this town?\"\n\nArtie took a tentative sip of whatever was in the mug. It tasted like fermented apples and bad math. \n\n[Stamina: +5]\n\n\"A nuisance?\" Artie suggested.\n\n\"A whale,\" Barnaby corrected, his expression turning uncharacteristically serious. \"In Oakhaven, 'Crits' aren't just a combat mechanic. They're the backbone of the local economy. The nobility here? They don't pray for rain or peace. They pray for high rolls. A man who can guarantee a Critical Hit every time he swings a fist? You\u2019re not a hero, Artie. You\u2019re a resource.\"\n\nArtie felt a cold lump form in his stomach that had nothing to do with the cider. He reached into his pocket_right, feeling the familiar edges of his Leather Wallet. It was empty of this world's currency, but it felt like a tether to a reality where 'Critical Hits' were just something that happened to other people's cars.\n\n\"I just want a place to hide,\" Artie said. \"Somewhere with a very high ceiling and zero sharp corners.\"\n\nBarnaby sighed, finally lighting his pipe. A cloud of sweet-smelling smoke drifted between them. \"Safety is expensive, lad. And you? You're glowing like a neon sign in a dark alley. That scanner at the gate didn't just flag you for the guards. It logged your stats into the local registry. By tomorrow morning, every 'talent scout' and 'mentor' in the city is going to be looking for the Level 3 glitch with the hundred-percent hit rate.\"\n\nArtie looked at the Participation Trophy in his hand. He\u2019d won it for surviving a slime-pocalypse, but now it felt like a target painted on his back. He thought about his Smartphone in his pocket_left, useless and dead, a relic of a world where the only thing he had to worry about was his 401k.\n\n\"So, what you're saying is,\" Artie said, his voice dropping to a whisper, \"I'm basically a winning lottery ticket that can be killed by a papercut.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Barnaby said, tapping his pipe against the bar. \"And in this world, people don't wait for the lottery to draw. They just take the ticket.\"\n\nArtie looked around the tavern. For the first time, the cozy atmosphere felt predatory. The shadows in the corners seemed a little deeper, the eyes of the other patrons a little sharper. He wasn't just a player in a game anymore. He was a glitch in a system that hated being broken, and a prize for anyone strong enough to claim him.\n\n[New Title Progress: One-Hit Wonder (2/10)]\n[Warning: Your presence has been logged by the Oakhaven Census Bureau.]\n\n\"Great,\" Artie muttered, resting his head back on the bar. \"I finally get to be a VIP, and the 'P' stands for 'Prey'.\"\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n
