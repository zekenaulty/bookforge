      "description": "Eldrin's 'fractured and indistinct' memories from a 'long slumber' could be interpreted as a form of amnesia. However, it is presented as a foundational state for the character's awakening and the mystery of the world's decline, rather than a convenient plot device to resolve existing continuity issues. It establishes his starting point and the need for discovery, which aligns with the 'Awakened Sage' premise. This is likely acceptable as a character's initial state rather than a 'device' to avoid plot complications."
