He felt the cold, gelatinous mass of the creature brush against the hem of his Linen Tunic. It was a sensation like wet, vibrating rubber, and it was the most terrifying thing he had ever felt.\n\n\"Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me,\" Artie hissed, his boots skidding on the damp moss. \n\nThe System\u2019s rounding rule was a guillotine hanging over his neck. In this world, 0.1 damage didn't just hurt; it rounded up to 1. And since Artie only had 1 HP, a vigorous high-five from a friendly NPC would likely result in a funeral. The slime gurgled, a sound like a clogged drain, and lunged.\n\nArtie pivoted, or at least he tried to. With 1 Agility, his body responded to his brain\u2019s commands with the urgency of a dial-up modem. He swung again, a desperate backhand meant to keep the creature at bay.\n\n[Attack Missed!]\n[Dexterity Check Failed: 1 vs 3]\n\nThe sword whistled through the space the slime had occupied a microsecond before. The creature was a tutorial mob\u2014the bottom of the food chain\u2014yet to Artie, it moved like a blur of neon-green malice. He was fighting a living puddle, and the puddle was winning.\n\n\"Come on, you stupid pile of Jell-O!\" \n\nHe lunged forward for a third strike, putting all his weight behind a thrust. The tip of the rusted blade caught on a protruding root. Artie stumbled, his nose nearly grazing the slime\u2019s acidic surface. He could smell it now: a sharp, chemical odor like industrial floor cleaner mixed with old lemon peels.\n\n[Attack Missed!]\n[Dexterity Check Failed: 1 vs 8]\n\nBehind him, the Whispering Woods lived up to their name. A nearby Patch-Note Oak, its bark etched with shimmering lines of code, began to groan. The sound wasn't the rustle of leaves, but a synthesized, monotone voice that vibrated in Artie's teeth.\n\n*\u201cPatch 1.2.0: Reduced the aggro radius of Lesser Slimes by fifteen percent to accommodate players with sub-optimal motor skills,\u201d* the tree recited. *\u201cFixed an issue where tutorial trees would occasionally scream during combat. Error. Error. Scream.exe not found.\u201d*\n\n\"Shut up!\" Artie roared, spinning around to deliver a horizontal slash. The slime flattened itself against the ground, the blade passing harmlessly through the air where its 'head' had been.\n\n[Attack Missed!]\n[Dexterity Check Failed: 1 vs 4]\n\nFour misses. His heart was hammering against his ribs, a frantic rhythm that felt like it might do the 1 point of damage necessary to kill him from the inside. He was cornered. To his left, a cluster of thorny brambles; to his right, the screaming Oak; and in front of him, the slime, which was now vibrating with the intensity of a heavy attack.\n\nThe creature\u2019s green core began to glow. This was the Heavy Attack the System had warned him about. If it landed, he wouldn't just be dead; he\u2019d be dissolved into a puddle of Arthur-flavored soup.\n\n\"Fifth time's the charm,\" Artie grunted, swinging the Broken Tutorial Sword in a wide, panicked arc. \n\n[Attack Missed!]\n[Dexterity Check Failed: 1 vs 12]\n\nThe sword struck the trunk of the Patch-Note Oak with a dull *thwack*. The tree didn't just take damage; it reacted.\n\n*\u201cWarning: Unauthorized modification of world geometry detected,\u201d* the tree droned. *\u201cApplying hotfix\u2026 Error. Error. Exception: NullPointerInMyFace.\u201d*\n\nThe slime launched. It was a full-body leap, a sphere of corrosive slime flying through the air toward Artie\u2019s chest. He had no time to dodge. His 1 Agility wouldn't allow it. He had no armor to speak of. He had 1 HP.\n\nHe did the only thing a man with 99 Luck and 100% Critical Hit rate could do. He closed his eyes and shoved the sword forward in a blind, pathetic jab.\n\nThe world didn't just make a sound; it broke.\n\n[System Notification: Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit!]\n\nThe moment the rusted tip of the Broken Tutorial Sword made contact with the slime\u2019s glowing core, the math of the universe folded in on itself. A guaranteed critical hit from a Statistical Anomaly wasn't just a \"harder hit.\" It was a violation of the local reality.\n\nA pillar of white-hot light erupted from the point of impact. The slime didn't die; it was deleted. Its mass was converted into pure kinetic energy that expanded outward in a perfect, devastating sphere. The shockwave hit Artie like a physical wall, but because he was the source of the crit, the System\u2019s 'Friendly Fire' protocols\u2014or perhaps just sheer confusion\u2014kept him from vaporizing.\n\nThe Patch-Note Oak behind the slime didn't fare as well. The tree, which had been busy reciting notes about improved lighting effects, was caught in the blast. Its trunk shattered into millions of glowing pixels. \n\n*\u201cPatch 1.3.1: Removed the ability for players to\u2014OH GOD THE ERRORS\u2014AAAAAAAGH!\u201d* \n\nThe tree\u2019s synthesized scream cut off as it was leveled, its entire structure reduced to a stump that continued to leak flickering red error messages into the grass. The slime was gone. The tree was gone. A fifty-foot furrow had been carved into the earth, ending in a smoking crater where a peaceful tutorial path had once been.\n\nArtie stood in the center of the destruction, his hand still gripping the hilt of the sword. The blade was no longer rusted; it was glowing with a faint, dying ember of the power it had just channeled.\n\nSilence fell over the Whispering Woods, save for the distant, faint sound of other trees whispering about a bug fix for \"sudden explosive deforestation.\"\n\nA golden light washed over Artie, warmer and more pleasant than the crit-blast.\n\n[Level Up!]\n[Level 1 -> Level 2]\n\n[Reward: 5 Stat Points allocated to 'Luck' (Automatic)]\n[Reward: 1 Stat Point allocated to 'Dexterity' (Pity Bonus)]\n\nArtie exhaled a breath he felt he\u2019d been holding since he died in front of that vending machine. He blinked, and his new stat sheet flickered into view.\n\n***\n\n**Character: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon**\n**Level: 2**\n**Class: [Locked - Statistical Anomaly]**\n**HP: 1/1**\n**MP: 1/1**\n\n**Stats:**\n*   **Strength:** 1\n*   **Agility:** 1\n*   **Intelligence:** 1\n*   **Vitality:** 1\n*   **Dexterity:** 2 (+1 Pity Bonus!)\n*   **Luck:** 104\n\n**Active Effects:**\n*   **[The Glassest Cannon]:** All damage taken is lethal.

This... this is going to be a very weird game.\"\n\nHe looked down at his Linen Tunic. It was perfectly clean, despite the carnage. He still had his single copper coin.

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nMechanics contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and labels (stats/skills) must be sourced from state or explicitly updated in the state_patch.

Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required

I rolled left, the grass staining my knees.\n\n[Stamina: 88/100]\n\n\"Missed me. Barely. That\u2019s a three-second cooldown on your spit, isn't it?\"\n\nI didn't wait for the confirmation. I lunged.
