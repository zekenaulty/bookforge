I have a three-o'clock with a guy who died trying to parkour off a moving train, and honestly, his stats are already looking more promising than yours,\" Fizz said, her pixelated wings buzzing near Artie\u2019s ear. She adjusted her miniature uniform, her expression one of practiced, professional impatience.\n\nArtie didn't look at her. He was too focused on the [Attribute Points: 100] blinking in the corner of his vision. Below it, his current stats were a depressing row of base tens, with one glaring exception.\n\n[STATS]\n- [Strength: 10]\n- [Agility: 10]\n- [Intelligence: 10]\n- [Constitution: 10]\n- [Luck: 1]\n- [Critical Hit Rate: 0.01%]\n\n\"Constitution,\" Artie muttered, his translucent hand trembling. \"I need Constitution.

A glorious, unkillable slab of meat.\"\n\n\"A noble goal for someone who just got taken out by a bag of Cool Ranch chips,\" Fizz remarked, inspecting her fingernails. \"But the Void has a bit of latency.

He intended to dump at least fifty points into it, enough to ensure that a stiff breeze wouldn't send him back to the respawn screen. But as his finger neared the glass-like interface, a sudden, violent spasm racked his ghostly frame\u2014a final, dying echo of the several thousand volts that had recently reorganized his nervous system.\n\nHis hand jerked. His finger didn't hit Constitution. It slammed into the 'Critical Hit Rate' slider and dragged it with the force of a desperate man.\n\n[Critical Hit Rate: 100%]\n[Remaining Attribute Points: 0]\n\nThe UI emitted a sound like a jackpot hitting on a rigged slot machine.\n\n\"Uh,\" Artie said, his heart\u2014or the place where it used to be\u2014sinking. \"Is that... supposed to happen?\"\n\nFizz flew closer, her eyes widening as she scanned the display. \"Did you just... you did. You put every single point into Crit. You didn't even touch Agility. Or Strength. Or, you know, the stat that keeps your lungs inflated.\"\n\n\"I can fix it,\" Artie said, his voice rising in panic. He reached for the 'Reset' button, but the latency chose that exact moment to vanish.

You\u2019re essentially a glass cannon, except the glass is already cracked.\"\n\nA new window erupted in front of Artie\u2019s face, glowing with an ominous, golden light.\n\n[System Notification: Title Acquired!]\n[Title: Crit or Quit (ID: TITLE_CRIT_OR_QUIT)]\n[Description: You have achieved the impossible\u2014a 100% Critical Hit rate at Level 1.

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nItem naming: use display_name for prose; use item_id only in JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nIf mechanics are shown in prose or UI, they must be present in continuity system state or added in continuity system updates in the same STATE_PATCH.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches.

never emit bare strings as array entries.\n- character_updates.containers must be an array of objects with at least: container, owner, contents (array).\n- Durable-state mutation blocks are mandatory when applicable:\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects; never an object with an `updates` field.\n- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.\n- If you mutate durable state, do not leave the same mutation only in prose.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n  - Each entry must include character_id, chapter, scene, inventory (full current list), containers (full current list), invariants_add (array), persona_updates (array).\n  - character_updates.inventory MUST be an array of objects, never string item ids.\n  - Inventory object shape: {\"item\": \"ITEM_or_name\", \"container\": \"hand_left|hand_right|<container>\", \"status\": \"held|carried|equipped|stowed\"}.\n  - Container object shape: {\"container\": \"<name>\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_id\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_id\", \"...\"]}.\n  - If you have a single persona update, still wrap it in an array of strings.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger and invariants using standard phrasing, e.g.:\n  - Avoid numeric mechanics in must_stay_true;

judgmental frequency of a middle-manager watching you take a long lunch. Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stood\u2014or rather, floated in a vaguely upright posture\u2014before a translucent wall of floating windows that looked like the offspring of a spreadsheet and a fever dream.\n\n\"Can we speed this up? I have a three-o'clock with a guy who died trying to parkour off a moving train, and honestly, his stats are already looking more promising than yours,\" a voice piped up from somewhere near Artie\u2019s left ear.\n\nArtie turned his head\u2014which felt like moving a bowling ball through molasses\u2014to see a small, flickering sprite. She looked like a pixie made of corrupted pixels and pure sass, wearing a miniature uniform that suggested she was either a flight attendant for the afterlife or a very high-ranking customer service representative.\n\n\"You're the System?\" Artie asked, his voice echoing in the neon void.\n\n\"I'm Fizz. Your Guide. Think of me as the tutorial pop-up you usually click 'Skip' on, except I can actually feel it when you're being an idiot,\" she said, crossing her tiny arms. \"Now, look at the screen. You\u2019ve got a 'Compensation Package' because the Vending Machine Incident was flagged as 'Statistically Improbable Malfunction.' You\u2019ve got one hundred Attribute Points. Spend them before I start charging you for the air you aren't currently breathing.\"\n\nArtie looked back at the UI. It was a mess of sliders and checkboxes.\n\n[Character Name: Arthur Penhaligon]\n[Race: Human (Basic/Boring)]\n[Class: UNASSIGNED]\n[HP: 0/100 (Status: Deceased)]\n[Attribute Points: 100]\n\n[STATS]\n- [Strength: 10]\n- [Agility: 10]\n- [Intelligence: 10]\n- [Constitution: 10]\n- [Luck: 1]\n- [Critical Hit Rate: 0.01%]\n\n\"Okay, okay,\" Artie muttered. \"Constitution seems important. I\u2019d like to not die again. Dying was... unpleasant. Very tingly. Zero stars.\"\n\nHe reached out a translucent hand toward the 'Constitution' slider. His fingers felt numb, a lingering side effect of the several thousand volts that had recently reorganized his nervous system. As he tried to grab the slider to pump his HP back into the triple digits, the UI flickered. \n\n\"Wait, why is it jumping?\" Artie asked, his hand spasming.\n\n\"The Void has a bit of latency,\" Fizz said, inspecting her fingernails. \"Or maybe it\u2019s just your soul\u2019s lingering trauma from the 'Cool Ranch' short circuit. Either way, move faster. I\u2019m losing my 'Patient Guide' buff and it\u2019s about to be replaced by 'Sarcastic Bystander.'\"\n\nArtie tried to steady his hand. He meant to slide Constitution to fifty. He really did. But as he lunged for the bar, the entire UI shifted to the right. His finger caught the edge of the 'Critical Hit Rate' slider instead.\n\n\"Whoa!\"\n\nThe slider didn't just move; it slammed to the far right with a sound like a jackpot hitting on a slot machine.\n\n[Critical Hit Rate: 100%]\n[Remaining Attribute Points: 0]\n\n\"Uh,\" Artie said, staring at the screen. \"Is that... supposed to happen?\"\n\nFizz flew closer, her pixelated wings buzzing. She squinted at the screen. \"Did you just... you did. You put every single point into Crit. You didn't even touch Agility. Or Strength. Or, you know, the stat that keeps your heart beating.\"\n\n\"I can fix it,\" Artie said, his voice rising in panic. He reached for the 'Reset' button, but his finger slipped again, brushing against the 'Confirm Build' prompt that had appeared in the center of his vision.\n\n[System Notification: Build Confirmed!]\n[Recalculating physical integrity based on selected attributes...]\n[Warning: Constitution remains at base level (10) with severe 'Deceased' penalty applied.]\n[Warning: HP has been capped to minimum viable threshold.]\n\n\"No, no, no! Undo! Ctrl-Z! Where is the Ctrl-Z?\" Artie shouted, poking at the air.\n\n\"There is no Ctrl-Z in the afterlife, Penhaligon,\" Fizz sighed, her voice dripping with a mix of pity and dark amusement. \"You just locked in a build with the durability of a wet paper towel and the offensive potential of a supernova. You\u2019re essentially a glass cannon, except the glass is already cracked.\"\n\n[System Notification: Title Acquired!]\n[Title: Crit or Quit]\n[Description: You have achieved the impossible\u2014a 100% Critical Hit rate at Level 1. You will either vaporize your enemies or be sneezed into oblivion. There is no middle ground.]\n[Effect: All successful hits are guaranteed Critical Hits. HP is permanently locked at 1. Any damage taken is fatal.]\n\nArtie stared at the new window. \n\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Crit Rate: 100%]\n\n\"One?\" Artie whispered. \"I have one hit point? I\u2019ve had paper cuts more threatening than my entire life force.\"\n\n\"On the bright side,\" Fizz said, patting him on the shoulder\u2014which felt like a static shock\u2014\"you\u2019ll never have to worry about long-term healthcare. If anything touches you, you're just... gone. It\u2019s very efficient, really.\"\n\n\"Efficiency isn't the word I\u2019d use,\" Artie groaned. He looked down at his hands. They were starting to solidify, turning from ghostly blue to a pale, fleshy tone. The void around him began to fragment, the neon lines of the Character Creation Suite dissolving into the rough textures of a forest floor.\n\n\"Wait, I'm not ready! I need to re-spec! Give me a survey! I'll give you a bad review!\"\n\n\"Review all you want,\" Fizz said, her form becoming more distinct as the world stabilized. She pulled a small, leather-bound book from a satchel at her hip\u2014the Standard Guide's Manual. \"But you\u2019re live, Artie. Welcome to the world of 'Crit-iculous.' Try not to trip on a pebble. It would be a very embarrassing way to end the series in the first chapter.\"\n\n[System Notification: Deployment Commencing...]\n[Location: Tutorial Zone - Whispering Woods]\n[Good luck, Anomaly. You're going to need it.]\n\nArtie felt the sudden, jarring sensation of gravity. His feet hit solid dirt. He wobbled, his heart hammering against his ribs\u2014a single, fragile beat that represented his entire existence. \n\n\"One HP,\" he muttered, looking at the floating red '1' in the corner of his vision. \"I'm a walking game-over screen.\"\n\n\"And a walking miracle,\" Fizz added, hovering just above his head. \"Now, look alive. Or as alive as one point of health allows. We\u2019ve got company.\"\n\nArtie didn't even have time to ask what she meant before a low growl echoed from the bushes. His 100% Crit Rate glowed in his peripheral vision, a golden promise of power that felt more like a death sentence.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n
