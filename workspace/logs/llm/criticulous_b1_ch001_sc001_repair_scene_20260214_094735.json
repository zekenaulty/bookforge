Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stood before the Snack-o-Matic 3000, his reflection in the plexiglass revealing a man whose mousy brown hair had finally given up on the concept of structure. His hazel eyes, usually sharp enough to spot a decimal error in a ten-thousand-row spreadsheet, were currently glazed with the hollow hunger of a man who had skipped lunch to fix a server migration.\n\nIn his right hand, he held a Crumpled Dollar Bill. It was a pathetic scrap of legal tender, softened by time and laundry cycles into something resembling a used tissue. Artie smoothed the Crumpled Dollar Bill against the edge of the machine's cold metal chassis, trying to coax some dignity back into the George Washington's wrinkled face. \n\n\"Come on, George,\" Artie whispered, his voice cracking. \"Just one bag of Cool Ranch. That\u2019s all I need to survive the 4:00 PM status meeting. Don't do this to me.\"\n\nHe fed the Crumpled Dollar Bill into the slot. The machine groaned, a mechanical sound of gears grinding against years of accumulated dust and spilled soda. The intake rollers grabbed the Crumpled Dollar Bill, pulled it halfway in, and then\u2014with a shudder that felt suspiciously like a shrug\u2014spat the Crumpled Dollar Bill back out.\n\nArtie caught the Crumpled Dollar Bill before it hit the sticky linoleum floor. He looked at his Corporate ID Badge, which dangled from a frayed blue lanyard around his neck. The photo on the badge showed a younger, more optimistic version of himself, a Junior Data Analyst who still believed that hard work resulted in something other than lower-back pain and a 1.0 Luck stat.\n\n\"You're seeing this, right?\" he asked the empty room. The only response was the rhythmic hum of a refrigerator that had been vibrating since the late nineties.\n\nHe tried again. This time, he used his thumb and forefinger to iron out the corners of the bill with the precision of a diamond cutter. He fed the Crumpled Dollar Bill in slowly. The machine swallowed it. The rollers whirred. A digital display, flickering with a dying orange glow, changed from zero to one dollar.\n\nArtie breathed a sigh of relief. He hovered his finger over the keypad. B-4. The position of the last remaining bag of chips. The holy grail of the afternoon slump. He pressed the buttons with a flourish.\n\nInside the machine, the metal coil began to rotate. The bag of chips shifted forward. It tilted. It reached the precipice. And then, the coil stopped. The bag hung there, suspended by a single plastic corner, dangling over the drop zone like a climber clinging to a cliff face in a low-budget action movie.\n\nThe orange display blinked a jam error.\n\n\"No,\" Artie said, his voice dropping to a dangerous register. \"No, no, no. You did not just do that.\"\n\nHe tapped the plexiglass. Nothing. He nudged the machine with his shoulder. The bag of chips didn't even quiver. \n\nArtie looked down at his slender frame. He wasn't a man of great physical power. His Strength was the kind of number that made gym teachers weep. But he had one thing: a lifetime of being screwed over by automated systems. He had a specific set of skills.\n\nHe gripped the edges of the Snack-o-Matic. He planted his feet on the linoleum, feeling the faint keyboard callus on his right palm burn against the metal. He began to shake.\n\nThis wasn't just a random tremor. This was a calculated, rhythmic assault. He pulled the machine forward and shoved it back, timing the oscillations to match the internal frequency of the snack coils. \n\n\"Give. Me. My. Chips!\" \n\nThe machine rattled. Inside, the bag of chips began to dance. Artie felt a surge of adrenaline. He was winning. For once in his miserable, data-driven life, he was going to beat the system. He ignored the Smartphone vibrating in his left pocket\u2014probably another urgent email about a broken pivot table. It didn't matter. The only metric that mattered was the distance between those chips and the bottom of the bin.\n\nSuddenly, the machine emitted a sound it had never made before\u2014a high-pitched, electronic whine that sounded like a choir of angels being fed through a blender. A spark jumped from the keypad to Artie\u2019s Corporate ID Badge.\n\nArtie didn't have time to wonder why a vending machine was suddenly outputting enough voltage to power a small suburb. He didn't have time to regret his career choices or the fact that his Leather Wallet, tucked safely in his right pocket, was currently the only thing between his thigh and a very hot piece of metal.\n\nA blue arc of electricity erupted from the coin slot. It bypassed the plastic buttons and slammed directly into Artie\u2019s chest, using the metal clip of his lanyard as a lightning rod.\n\nThe world didn't go black. It went neon. \n\nArtie felt his heart skip a beat, then decide it was done with the whole 'beating' thing entirely. A mental notification, sounding suspiciously like a system alert, screamed that a fatal error had been detected in his user profile. Reality itself seemed to flicker, the stability of his surroundings dropping to a precarious ninety-nine percent as the world pixelated at the edges. His muscles locked, his fingers fused to the metal frame of the machine.\n\nThe hum of the breakroom was replaced by a digital roar. Artie\u2019s last thought wasn't of his family, or his unrequited love for the receptionist, or even the chips. \n\nIt was: *I bet the machine keeps my dollar.*\n\nThen, the surge peaked. Arthur Penhaligon, Junior Data Analyst and victim of a 1.0 Luck stat, collapsed to the floor. The bag of chips finally fell, landing softly on his chest. \n\nHe was very, very dead.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present\": [\"CHAR_ARTIE\"],\n    \"location\": \"Office Breakroom\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie was electrocuted by a vending machine while trying to get chips.\",\n      \"Artie has died and his consciousness is transitioning to the System.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"inventory\": [\n        {\n          \"item_id\": \"ITEM_OFFICE_ID\",\n          \"container\": \"lanyard\",\n          \"status\": \"equipped\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"item_id\": \"ITEM_SMARTPHONE\",\n          \"container\": \"pocket_left\",\n          \"status\": \"stowed\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"item_id\": \"ITEM_WALLET\",\n          \"container\": \"pocket_right\",\n          \"status\": \"stowed\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        {\n          \"container\": \"lanyard\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n          \"contents\": [\"ITEM_OFFICE_ID\"]\n        },\n        {\n          \"container\": \"pocket_left\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n          \"contents\": [\"ITEM_SMARTPHONE\"]\n        },\n        {\n          \"container\": \"pocket_right\",\n          \"owner\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n          \"contents\": [\"ITEM_WALLET\"]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"appearance_updates\": {\n        \"set\": {\n          \"atoms\": {\n            \"health_status\": \"deceased\"\n          },\n          \"marks_add\": [\n            {\n              \"name\": \"Severe Electrical Burns\",\n              \"location\": \"chest\",\n              \"durability\": \"durable\"\n            }\n          ]\n        },\n        \"reason\": \"Fatal electrocution by vending machine.\"\n      },\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie's final thought was a cynical observation about the vending machine keeping his money.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"character_continuity_system_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"set\": {\n        \"stats\": {\n          \"hp\": {\n            \"current\": 0,\n            \"max\": 10\n          },\n          \"lck\": 1.0\n        }\n      },\n      \"reason\": \"Artie has died; establishing base luck stat mentioned in narrative.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"set\": {\n        \"reality_stability\": 99\n      },\n      \"reason\": \"Reality flickered during the fatal electrical surge.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"item_registry_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"item_id\": \"ITEM_CRUMPLED_DOLLAR\",\n      \"set\": {\n        \"custodian\": \"world\",\n        \"last_seen\": {\n          \"chapter\": 1,\n          \"scene\": 1,\n          \"location\": \"Office Breakroom (Inside Vending Machine)\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"transfer_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"item_id\": \"ITEM_CRUMPLED_DOLLAR\",\n      \"source\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"destination\": \"world\",\n      \"reason\": \"Artie fed the bill into the vending machine before dying.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie attempted to buy chips from a malfunctioning vending machine using a Crumpled Dollar Bill.\",\n      \"After the machine jammed, Artie's aggressive shaking triggered a massive electrical surge.\",\n      \"Artie was electrocuted and died, his Corporate ID Badge acting as a lightning rod.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Artie smoothed and fed the Crumpled Dollar Bill into the Snack-o-Matic 3000.\",\n      \"The machine jammed on the last bag of Cool Ranch chips.\",\n      \"Artie shook the machine, triggering a high-voltage discharge.\",\n      \"A fatal blue arc of electricity struck Artie in the chest.\",\n      \"Artie died on the breakroom floor as the chips finally fell.\",\n      \"Reality stability flickered to 99% during the incident.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"milestone: artie_death = DONE\",\n      \"REMOVE: inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Crumpled Dollar Bill (status=carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Corporate ID Badge (status=equipped, container=lanyard)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Smartphone (status=stowed, container=pocket_left)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Leather Wallet (status=stowed, container=pocket_right)\",\n      \"container: lanyard (owner=CHAR_ARTIE, contents=[ITEM_OFFICE_ID])\",\n      \"container: pocket_left (owner=CHAR_ARTIE, contents=[ITEM_SMARTPHONE])\",\n      \"container: pocket_right (owner=CHAR_ARTIE, contents=[ITEM_WALLET])\",\n      \"reality_stability: 99% (flickered)\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Artie dies in a mundane but absurd vending machine accident.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",

    "system": "\ufeff# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nUI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says \"always include\".\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true. If a prior invariant is stale or superseded, you MUST flag it for removal using \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" before restating the current truth.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v2\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nFor durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nFor durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).\nUse canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - INVALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": {\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}\n  - VALID: \"global_continuity_system_updates\": [{\"set\": {\"reality_stability\": 94}}]\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the

        "content": "# REPAIR\n\nFix the scene based on lint issues.\nSummaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\nTimeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: pre-scene invariants and summary facts are binding unless the Scene Card depicts a change. If this scene changes a durable fact, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value and remove the old entry.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n\n- must_stay_true removal (mandatory when a durable fact is superseded):\n  - Add \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" in summary_update.must_stay_true.\n  - Place REMOVE lines before the new final invariant.\n  - REMOVE lines also apply to key_facts_ring (purge stale facts from continuity).\n\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- Inventory posture reconciliation:\n  - If inventory/containers change (held/stowed/container), must_stay_true must be updated to the final posture.\n  - Add REMOVE lines for prior inventory/container invariants before the new final entries.\n  - Use canonical invariant formats:\n    - inventory: CHAR_X -> <item display_name> (status=held|carried|equipped|stowed, container=hand_left|hand_right|<container>)\n    - container: <container> (owner=CHAR_X, contents=[<item display_name>, ...])\nFor held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\nContinuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.\n- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.\n- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.\n- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI gate: only include bracketed UI blocks when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If false, remove or rephrase UI blocks into narrative prose.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or a short parenthetical annotation (e.g., (locked), (Warning: ...)).\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nCanonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\nIf item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for authoritative labels and custody terms.\nUse item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If a durable appearance change occurs in this scene, record it in character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- APPEARANCE_CHECK is required in COMPLIANCE for each cast_present_id (4-8 tokens from atoms/marks).\n\nNaming repairs:\n- If lint flags an item naming issue, fix it with minimal edits.\n- Do not remove humor; simply anchor the item (add display_name near first mention) and ensure custody-change sentences include the display_name.\n- Do not rename item_id or registry fields; only adjust prose wording.\nsummary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\nSTATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\nmust_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\nIf state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\nEnforce scene-card durable constraints: `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\nRespect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`.\n\n- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):\n  - If timeline_scope != \"present\" OR ontological_scope != \"real\", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).\n  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.\n  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category=\"timeline_override\".\n\nReturn corrected prose plus a corrected state_patch JSON block.\n\nOutput format (required, no code fences, no commentary):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n\nAPPEARANCE_CHECK:\n- CHAR_ID: <4-8 tokens from atoms/marks>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects.

Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_device_id, replacement_of.\n  - custodian must be a non-null string id/scope (character id or \"world\"). Never use null.\n    - INVALID: \"custodian\": null\n    - VALID: \"custodian\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\" or \"world\"\n  - owner_scope must be \"character\" or \"world\" and must match the custodian scope.\n  - plot_device_updates: set must include name, custody_scope, custody_ref, activation_state, linked_threads, constraints, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.\n  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.\n\n- Transfer vs registry conflict rule (must follow):\n  - If you create a NEW item in item_registry_updates with final custodian already set (e.g., CHAR_ARTIE), DO NOT emit transfer_updates for that item.\n  - If you emit transfer_updates for a NEW item, the registry entry must start with custodian=\"world\" and then transfer to the character.\n  - expected_before must match the registry entry at the moment of transfer (after any registry update that applies before it).  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.\n  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.\n  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.\n  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).\n  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).\n  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects; never an object with an `updates` field.\n\n  - inventory_alignment_updates[*].set MUST be an object (not a list).\n    - INVALID: \"set\": []\n    - VALID:   \"set\": {\"inventory\": [...], \"containers\": [...]}\n- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.\n- If you mutate durable state, do not leave the same mutation only in prose.\n- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).\n- appearance_updates: when a durable appearance change happens, include appearance_updates on the relevant character_updates entry.\n\n  - appearance_updates MUST be an object, not an array.\n    - INVALID: \"appearance_updates\": [{\"set\": {...}, \"reason\": \"...\"}]\n    - VALID: \"appearance_updates\": {\"set\": {\"marks_add\": [{\"name\": \"Singed Hair\", \"location\": \"head\", \"durability\": \"durable\"}]}, \"reason\": \"...\"}\n\n  - appearance_updates.set may include atoms and marks only (canonical truth).\n    - Do NOT put marks_add at the top level; it belongs under set.\n    - Use set.marks_add / set.marks_remove for marks changes.\n    - Use set.atoms for atom changes.\n  - appearance_updates.reason is required (brief, factual).\n  - Do NOT set summary or art text in appearance_updates (derived after acceptance)\n  - Each entry must include character_id, chapter, scene, inventory (full current list), containers (full current list), invariants_add (array), persona_updates (array).\n  - character_updates.inventory MUST be an array of objects, never string item ids.\n  - Inventory object shape: {\"item\": \"ITEM_or_name\", \"container\": \"hand_left|hand_right|<container>\", \"status\": \"held|carried|equipped|stowed\"}.\n  - Container object shape: {\"container\": \"<name>\", \"owner\": \"CHAR_id\", \"contents\": [\"ITEM_id\", \"...\"]}.\n  - If you have a single persona update, still wrap it in an array of strings.\n- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger and invariants using standard phrasing, e.g.:\n  - Avoid numeric mechanics in must_stay_true;

Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stood before the Snack-o-Matic 3000, his reflection in the plexiglass revealing a man whose mousy brown hair had finally given up on the concept of structure. His hazel eyes, usually sharp enough to spot a decimal error in a ten-thousand-row spreadsheet, were currently glazed with the hollow hunger of a man who had skipped lunch to fix a server migration.\n\nIn his right hand, he held a Crumpled Dollar Bill. It was a pathetic scrap of legal tender, softened by time and laundry cycles into something resembling a used tissue. Artie smoothed it against the edge of the machine's cold metal chassis, trying to coax some dignity back into the George Washington's wrinkled face. \n\n\"Come on, George,\" Artie whispered, his voice cracking. \"Just one bag of Cool Ranch. That\u2019s all I need to survive the 4:00 PM status meeting. Don't do this to me.\"\n\nHe fed the bill into the slot. The machine groaned, a mechanical sound of gears grinding against years of accumulated dust and spilled soda. The intake rollers grabbed the Crumpled Dollar Bill, pulled it halfway in, and then\u2014with a shudder that felt suspiciously like a shrug\u2014spat it back out.\n\nArtie caught it before it hit the sticky linoleum floor. He looked at his Corporate ID Badge, which dangled from a frayed blue lanyard around his neck. The photo on the badge showed a younger, more optimistic version of himself, a Junior Data Analyst who still believed that hard work resulted in something other than lower-back pain and a 1.0 Luck stat.\n\n\"You're seeing this, right?\" he asked the empty room. The only response was the rhythmic hum of a refrigerator that had been vibrating since the late nineties.\n\nHe tried again. This time, he used his thumb and forefinger to iron out the corners of the bill with the precision of a diamond cutter. He fed it in slowly. The machine swallowed it. The rollers whirred. A digital display, flickering with a dying orange glow, changed from $0.00 to $1.00.\n\nArtie breathed a sigh of relief. He hovered his finger over the keypad. B-4. The position of the last remaining bag of chips. The holy grail of the afternoon slump. He pressed the buttons with a flourish.\n\nInside the machine, the metal coil began to rotate. The bag of chips shifted forward. It tilted. It reached the precipice. And then, the coil stopped. The bag hung there, suspended by a single plastic corner, dangling over the drop zone like a climber clinging to a cliff face in a low-budget action movie.\n\nThe orange display blinked: [ERROR: JAM].\n\n\"No,\" Artie said, his voice dropping to a dangerous register. \"No, no, no. You did not just do that.\"\n\nHe tapped the plexiglass. Nothing. He nudged the machine with his shoulder. The bag of chips didn't even quiver. \n\nArtie looked down at his slender frame. He wasn't a man of great physical power. His Strength was the kind of number that made gym teachers weep. But he had one thing: a lifetime of being screwed over by automated systems. He had a specific set of skills.\n\nHe gripped the edges of the Snack-o-Matic. He planted his feet on the linoleum, feeling the faint keyboard callus on his right palm burn against the metal. He began to shake.\n\nThis wasn't just a random tremor. This was a calculated, rhythmic assault. He pulled the machine forward and shoved it back, timing the oscillations to match the internal frequency of the snack coils. \n\n\"Give. Me. My. Chips!\" \n\nThe machine rattled. Inside, the bag of chips began to dance. Artie felt a surge of adrenaline. He was winning. For once in his miserable, data-driven life, he was going to beat the system. He ignored the Smartphone vibrating in his left pocket\u2014probably another urgent email about a broken pivot table. It didn't matter. The only metric that mattered was the distance between those chips and the bottom of the bin.\n\nSuddenly, the machine emitted a sound it had never made before\u2014a high-pitched, electronic whine that sounded like a choir of angels being fed through a blender. A spark jumped from the keypad to Artie\u2019s Corporate ID Badge.\n\nArtie didn't have time to wonder why a vending machine was suddenly outputting enough voltage to power a small suburb. He didn't have time to regret his career choices or the fact that his Leather Wallet, tucked safely in his right pocket, was currently the only thing between his thigh and a very hot piece of metal.\n\nA blue arc of electricity erupted from the coin slot. It bypassed the plastic buttons and slammed directly into Artie\u2019s chest, using the metal clip of his lanyard as a lightning rod.\n\nThe world didn't go black. It went neon. \n\nArtie felt his heart skip a beat, then decide it was done with the whole 'beating' thing entirely. His vision filled with scrolling lines of white text that he couldn't quite read, flickering like a corrupted monitor. His muscles locked, his fingers fused to the metal frame of the machine.\n\n[System Alert: Fatal Error detected in User_Artie_001.]\n[Reality Stability: 99.9%... 99.8%...]\n\nThe hum of the breakroom was replaced by a digital roar. Artie\u2019s last thought wasn't of his family, or his unrequited love for the receptionist, or even the chips. \n\nIt was: *I bet the machine keeps my dollar.*\n\nThen, the surge peaked. Arthur Penhaligon, Junior Data Analyst and victim of a 1.0 Luck stat, collapsed to the floor. The bag of chips finally fell, landing softly on his chest. \n\nHe was very, very dead.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n
