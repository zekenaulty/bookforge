PROSE:
The smoke from the vaporized ancient tree was still stinging Artie's lungs when the golden light manifested in front of his face. It didn't gently descend; it popped into existence with the obnoxious chime of a microwave finishing a bag of popcorn.

"Congratulations," Fizz said, her neon-blue form flickering with a static-heavy sigh. "You’ve successfully broken the tutorial's physics engine. I hope you’re proud of yourself. The System had to pull from the 'Emergency Compensation' pool for this one."

Artie reached out and grabbed the Participation Trophy floating in the air. It felt like cheap, gold-plated plastic, a mocking weight in his left hand.

[Item Received: Participation Trophy (Cursed)]
[Type: Cursed Accessory]
[Rarity: Rare (Glitch-Tier)]
[Description: Awarded to those who achieve a victory so statistically improbable that the System assumes you’re cheating but can’t prove it. It’s ugly, it’s heavy, and it smells like ozone and desperation.]
[Passive Effect: Monster Beacon – Your presence is now broadcast on all frequencies. Monsters within 1km are aware of your location and find your face personally insulting.]
[Note: This item is Soulbound. You can’t drop it. You can’t sell it. You can only regret it.]

"Wait, 'personally insulting'?" Artie looked down at the Participation Trophy. It featured a small, golden figure of a man tripping over a rock while holding a calculator. "Fizz, what does 'Monster Beacon' actually do in numerical terms?"

"In numerical terms?" Fizz zipped around his head, her pixelated trail leaving a streak of blue light in the smoky air. "It means your Aggro Meter is about to become a vertical line. Look up, Artie. Quickly."

Artie looked. Above his 1/1 HP bar, a new UI element had appeared. It was a jagged red eye that was currently pulsing with an angry, rhythmic light.

[Aggro Meter: 94% (Rising...)]

A low, guttural growl echoed from the shadows of the remaining trees. Then another. And a third that sounded like a blender full of gravel. The lush forest suddenly felt a lot less like a tutorial zone and a lot more like a buffet where Artie was the only thing on the menu.

"The slime," Artie whispered, his heart hammering against his ribs. "The explosion. Did it attract them?"

"The explosion was the dinner bell," Fizz said, her voice rising an octave. "The trophy is the GPS coordinates. Artie, you have exactly one hit point. If a squirrel sneezes on you, we both go back to the void, and I get demoted to 'Loading Screen Tip' status. Run!"

[System Warning: Local Aggro Threshold Exceeded!]
[Status Inflicted: Marked for Death]
[Description: Every monster in the 'Lush Forest' sub-zone is now sprinting toward your coordinates. Good luck, Anomaly.]

Artie didn't wait for a second warning. He turned and bolted. His dress shirt, already rumpled and stained with office coffee and slime residue, billowed behind him. His Corporate ID Badge bounced painfully against his collarbone with every step.

[Stamina: 92/100]

The forest, which had seemed peaceful ten minutes ago, was now a cacophony of snapping branches and predatory shrieks. To Artie's left, a pair of glowing red eyes burst through a thicket of ferns. He didn't stay to see what they belonged to. He just focused on the distant, shimmering outline of stone walls on the horizon—Oakhaven.

"Is there a sprint button?" Artie wheezed, his lungs burning. "Because I really need a sprint button!"

"You're already using it! It's called 'Adrenaline and Terror'!" Fizz shouted, hovering effortlessly beside his ear. "Left! Go left! There’s a pack of Razor-Toothed Rabbits closing in from the right!"

Artie veered left, his boots skidding on a patch of moss. He nearly lost his balance, which would have been a death sentence.

[Stamina: 75/100]

[HP: 1/1]

The absurdity of it hit him even as he dodged a low-hanging branch. He was a Level 2 "Statistical Anomaly" with the power to vaporize gods, but he was currently being hunted by bunnies because he was holding a piece of plastic that made him smell like a target.

"Can I put the trophy in my pocket?" Artie yelled over the sound of something large and heavy crashing through the underbrush behind them.

"It’s a beacon, Artie! It doesn't matter if you put it in a lead box or up your—" Fizz cut herself off as a projectile—a glob of hardened sap—whistled past Artie's head, missing by an inch. "Just run! The gates are only two kilometers away!"

"Only two kilometers?" Artie looked at his rapidly depleting stamina bar. "I’m an analyst! I haven't run two kilometers since the elevator in the office broke in 2019!"

[Stamina: 60/100]

Behind him, the forest was alive with the sound of a hundred monsters converging on a single point. The Aggro Meter hit 100% and turned a dark, bruised purple. 

[New Quest: Run for Your Life!]
[Objective: Reach the Oakhaven Gate Scanners.]
[Reward: Not dying.]
[Failure: Deletion.]

"I hate this game," Artie panted, his vision starting to tunnel. "I really, really hate this game."

"Save your breath for the sprinting!" Fizz urged.

Artie gripped the Participation Trophy tighter, its golden surface mocking him in the dappled sunlight. He could see the gates now—massive, iron-bound structures guarded by men in shining armor. They looked safe. They looked solid. They also looked a very, very long way away.

He pushed his legs harder, the wind whipping past his ears as the first of the pursuers—a lean, grey wolf with far too many teeth—broke cover behind him. 

"Don't look back!" Fizz screamed.

Artie didn't. He just ran.
