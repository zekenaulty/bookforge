It was just an infinite expanse of white static that smelled faintly of ozone and unwashed server racks. He drifted in the nothingness, his Corporate ID Badge dangling from its lanyard and tapping rhythmically against the severe electrical burns on his chest. Every tap was a reminder that he\u2019d been killed by a snack machine.\n\n\"Listen, User 404-Penhaligon, we really need to focus,\" a voice buzzed. It sounded like a hummingbird with a megaphone.\n\nArtie looked up. Fizz was a tiny, glowing blue sprite with spiky neon blue hair that seemed to vibrate with every syllable. She was currently hovering three inches from his nose, her white eyes narrowed in what Artie assumed was the digital equivalent of a headache.\n\n\"I\u2019m focusing,\" Artie said, his voice echoing in the empty space. \"I\u2019m looking at the shiny buttons. I like buttons. Usually, they give me chips. This time, they just give me... what is 'Vigor' again?\"\n\n[System Notification: Character Creation Phase 2/3]\n[Available Points: 10]\n[Bonus Anomaly Pool: 50] (Warning: Unstable Source Detected)\n\n\"Vigor is survival, Arthur,\" Fizz said, her wings trailing pixelated dust. \"It increases your HP. You know, the stuff that keeps you from being a ghost? Which, technically, you already are, but we're trying to fix that. Most players put at least five points into Vigor. It\u2019s the \u2018don't die in one hit\u2019 tax.\"\n\nArtie ignored her, his hazel eyes fixed on the Bonus Anomaly Pool. Fifty points. That was a lot of points. He felt the faint keyboard callus on his right palm itch\u2014a phantom sensation from a life spent clicking through spreadsheets. He was a man of optimization. He was a man who knew that in a world of variables, 100% was the only number that mattered.\n\n\"And what\u2019s this one?\" Artie pointed at a stat near the bottom of the list. \"Critical Hit Rate.\"\n\nFizz\u2019s glow dimmed to a worried shade of indigo. \"That? That\u2019s for rogues and gamblers. It\u2019s capped at 25% for Level 1 characters. The System doesn't like certainties, Arthur. It likes math. It likes the struggle.\"\n\n\"I\u2019ve had enough struggle,\" Artie muttered. He reached out and tapped the 'plus' icon next to Critical Hit Rate. \n\n[Warning: Stat Allocation exceeds Level 1 soft-cap. Proceed?]\n\nHe tapped it again. And again. He dumped all ten of his standard points into the stat. Then, with a grin that felt far too wide for a dead man, he dragged the entire fifty-point Bonus Anomaly Pool into the same slot.\n\n\"Wait! No!\" Fizz shrieked, diving toward the floating screen. \"You can't just\u2014that pool is from a reality-glitch death! It\u2019s not balanced! You\u2019re going to\u2014\"\n\n[System Error: Statistical Anomaly Detected]\n[Recalculating...]\n[Critical Hit Rate: 100%]\n[Condition Triggered: Glass Soul]\n[Penalty: HP locked at minimum value.]\n\nArtie felt a sudden, sharp chill. It wasn't the cold of the void; it was the sensation of his very essence being stretched thin, like a single sheet of gold foil. He looked down at his hands. They were pale, almost translucent.\n\n[System Notification: Build Finalized]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Crit Rate: 100%]\n\n\"One?\" Artie blinked. \"I have one hit point?\"\n\n\"You have one hit point,\" Fizz deadpanned, her blue hair sagging. \"A stiff breeze will kill you. A particularly aggressive sneeze from a goblin will delete your save file. You are a glass cannon without the cannon part. You\u2019re just... glass.\"\n\n\"But I have 100% Crit,\" Artie countered, his confidence returning as he processed the math. \"That means every time I hit something, I hit it where it hurts. Every time. No RNG. No luck. Just... results.\"\n\n\"You\u2019re an idiot,\" Fizz whispered.\n\n[Title Unlocked: Crit or Quit]\n[Effect: All damage dealt is guaranteed to be a Critical Hit. All damage received is guaranteed to be fatal.]\n\n\"See? The System even gave me a title,\" Artie said, patting the pocket of his trousers where his Smartphone and Leather Wallet were still stowed. \"It\u2019s practically an endorsement.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s a warning label,\" Fizz snapped. \"And now, because you\u2019ve broken the tutorial before it even started, we\u2019re being fast-tracked. The System doesn't want you in the void anymore. It wants you somewhere you can be 'balanced' by a monster.\"\n\nThe white static around them began to ripple and tear. The smell of ozone was replaced by the scent of damp grass and something vaguely sweet. The void was dissolving, replaced by rolling green hills and a sky that was a bit too blue to be natural.\n\n\"Welcome to the Slime Fields, Arthur,\" Fizz said, her wings buzzing with a frantic energy as she began to fade into her invisible 'Guide' mode. \"Try not to trip on a pebble. I'm pretty sure that would count as crushing damage.\"\n\nArtie stood on the new grass, his Corporate ID Badge swinging. He felt light. Terribly, dangerously light. \n\n\"One HP,\" he whispered to himself, looking at a translucent green blob wobbling in the distance. \"Well.

    "system": "\ufeff# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nProse hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative (\"left hand\", \"right hand\", \"Artie\", \"his wallet\").\nItem naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.\nAppearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nContinuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.\nUI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says \"always include\".\nContinuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.\nDurable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.\nJSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.\nInventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true. If a prior invariant is stale or superseded, you MUST flag it for removal using \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" before restating the current truth.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v2\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head.

        "content": "# REPAIR\n\nFix the scene based on lint issues.\nSummaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.\nTimeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: pre-scene invariants and summary facts are binding unless the Scene Card depicts a change. If this scene changes a durable fact, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value and remove the old entry.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.\n\n- must_stay_true reconciliation (mandatory):\n  - If you change a durable value in the patch, you must update must_stay_true to match the end-of-scene value.\n  - Remove conflicting old invariants rather than preserving them.\n\n- must_stay_true removal (mandatory when a durable fact is superseded):\n  - Add \"REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>\" in summary_update.must_stay_true.\n  - Place REMOVE lines before the new final invariant.\n  - REMOVE lines also apply to key_facts_ring (purge stale facts from continuity).\n\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\n- Inventory posture reconciliation:\n  - If inventory/containers change (held/stowed/container), must_stay_true must be updated to the final posture.\n  - Add REMOVE lines for prior inventory/container invariants before the new final entries.\n  - Use canonical invariant formats:\n    - inventory: CHAR_X -> <item display_name> (status=held|carried|equipped|stowed, container=hand_left|hand_right|<container>)\n    - container: <container> (owner=CHAR_X, contents=[<item display_name>, ...])\nFor held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\nContinuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.\nDurable vs ephemeral mechanics:\n- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.\n- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.\n- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.\n- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.\n- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.\n- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.\n- UI gate: only include bracketed UI blocks when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If false, remove or rephrase UI blocks into narrative prose.\n- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.\n- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.\n- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or a short parenthetical annotation (e.g., (locked), (Warning: ...)).\n\n- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).\n- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.\nCanonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.\nIf item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for authoritative labels and custody terms.\nUse item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.\nAppearance contract:\n- Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned. Do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.\n- appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change.\n- Durable appearance changes must be declared in scene_card.durable_appearance_changes (or an explicit appearance milestone) and recorded via appearance_updates.\n- If a durable appearance change occurs in this scene, record it in character_updates.appearance_updates with a reason.\n- APPEARANCE_CHECK is required in COMPLIANCE for each cast_present_id (4-8 tokens from atoms/marks).\n\nNaming repairs:\n- If lint flags an item naming issue, fix it with minimal edits.\n- Do not remove humor; simply anchor the item (add display_name near first mention) and ensure custody-change sentences include the display_name.\n- Do not rename item_id or registry fields; only adjust prose wording.\nsummary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\nSTATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.\nmust_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.\nIf state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.\nEnforce scene-card durable constraints: `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.\nRespect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`.\n\n- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):\n  - If timeline_scope != \"present\" OR ontological_scope != \"real\", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).\n  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.\n  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category=\"timeline_override\".\n\nReturn corrected prose plus a corrected state_patch JSON block.\n\nOutput format (required, no code fences, no commentary):\nCOMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>\nAllowed events: <short list from Scene Card>\nForbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>\n\nAPPEARANCE_CHECK:\n- CHAR_ID: <4-8 tokens from atoms/marks>\n\nPROSE:\n<scene prose>\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n<json>\n\nSTATE_PATCH rules:\n- Use schema_version \"1.0\".\n- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).\n- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).\n- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).\n- Do not invent new character or thread ids.\n- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).\n- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).\n- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.\n- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.\n  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.\n  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.\n  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{\"name\": \"Novice\", \"source\": \"starting_class\", \"active\": true}]).\n  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.\n- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.\n\n- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects.

Never use null.\n    - INVALID: \"custodian\": null\n    - VALID: \"custodian\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\" or \"world\"\n  - owner_scope must be \"character\" or \"world\" and must match the custodian scope.\n  - plot_device_updates: set must include name, custody_scope, custody_ref, activation_state, linked_threads, constraints, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}.

It was just an infinite expanse of white static that smelled faintly of ozone and unwashed server racks. He drifted in the nothingness, his Corporate ID Badge dangling from its lanyard and tapping rhythmically against the severe electrical burns on his chest. Every tap was a reminder that he\u2019d been killed by a snack machine.\n\n\"Listen, User 404-Penhaligon, we really need to focus,\" a voice buzzed. It sounded like a hummingbird with a megaphone.\n\nArtie looked up. Fizz was a tiny, glowing blue sprite with spiky neon blue hair that seemed to vibrate with every syllable. She was currently hovering three inches from his nose, her white eyes narrowed in what Artie assumed was the digital equivalent of a headache.\n\n\"I\u2019m focusing,\" Artie said, his voice echoing in the empty space. \"I\u2019m looking at the shiny buttons. I like buttons. Usually, they give me chips. This time, they just give me... what is 'Vigor' again?\"\n\n[System Notification: Character Creation Phase 2/3]\n[Available Points: 10]\n[Bonus Anomaly Pool: 50] (Warning: Unstable Source Detected)\n\n\"Vigor is survival, Arthur,\" Fizz said, her wings trailing pixelated dust. \"It increases your HP. You know, the stuff that keeps you from being a ghost? Which, technically, you already are, but we're trying to fix that. Most players put at least five points into Vigor. It\u2019s the \u2018don't die in one hit\u2019 tax.\"\n\nArtie ignored her, his hazel eyes fixed on the Bonus Anomaly Pool. Fifty points. That was a lot of points. He felt the faint keyboard callus on his right palm itch\u2014a phantom sensation from a life spent clicking through spreadsheets. He was a man of optimization. He was a man who knew that in a world of variables, 100% was the only number that mattered.\n\n\"And what\u2019s this one?\" Artie pointed at a stat near the bottom of the list. \"Critical Hit Rate.\"\n\nFizz\u2019s glow dimmed to a worried shade of indigo. \"That? That\u2019s for rogues and gamblers. It\u2019s capped at 25% for Level 1 characters. The System doesn't like certainties, Arthur. It likes math. It likes the struggle.\"\n\n\"I\u2019ve had enough struggle,\" Artie muttered. He reached out and tapped the 'plus' icon next to Critical Hit Rate. \n\n[Warning: Stat Allocation exceeds Level 1 soft-cap. Proceed?]\n\nHe tapped it again. And again. He dumped all ten of his standard points into the stat. Then, with a grin that felt far too wide for a dead man, he dragged the entire fifty-point Bonus Anomaly Pool into the same slot.\n\n\"Wait! No!\" Fizz shrieked, diving toward the floating screen. \"You can't just\u2014that pool is from a reality-glitch death! It\u2019s not balanced! You\u2019re going to\u2014\"\n\n[System Error: Statistical Anomaly Detected]\n[Recalculating...]\n[Critical Hit Rate: 100%]\n[Condition Triggered: Glass Soul]\n[Penalty: HP locked at minimum value.]\n\nArtie felt a sudden, sharp chill. It wasn't the cold of the void; it was the sensation of his very essence being stretched thin, like a single sheet of gold foil. He looked down at his hands. They were pale, almost translucent.\n\n[System Notification: Build Finalized]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Crit Rate: 100%]\n\n\"One?\" Artie blinked. \"I have one hit point?\"\n\n\"You have one hit point,\" Fizz deadpanned, her blue hair sagging. \"A stiff breeze will kill you. A particularly aggressive sneeze from a goblin will delete your save file. You are a glass cannon without the cannon part. You\u2019re just... glass.\"\n\n\"But I have 100% Crit,\" Artie countered, his confidence returning as he processed the math. \"That means every time I hit something, I hit it where it hurts. Every time. No RNG. No luck. Just... results.\"\n\n\"You\u2019re an idiot,\" Fizz whispered.\n\n[Title Unlocked: Crit or Quit]\n[Effect: All damage dealt is guaranteed to be a Critical Hit. All damage received is guaranteed to be fatal.]\n\n\"See? The System even gave me a title,\" Artie said, patting the pocket of his trousers where his Smartphone and Leather Wallet were still stowed. \"It\u2019s practically an endorsement.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s a warning label,\" Fizz snapped. \"And now, because you\u2019ve broken the tutorial before it even started, we\u2019re being fast-tracked. The System doesn't want you in the void anymore. It wants you somewhere you can be 'balanced' by a monster.\"\n\nThe white static around them began to ripple and tear. The smell of ozone was replaced by the scent of damp grass and something vaguely sweet. The void was dissolving, replaced by rolling green hills and a sky that was a bit too blue to be natural.\n\n\"Welcome to the Slime Fields, Arthur,\" Fizz said, her wings buzzing with a frantic energy as she began to fade into her invisible 'Guide' mode. \"Try not to trip on a pebble. I'm pretty sure that would count as crushing damage.\"\n\nArtie stood on the new grass, his Corporate ID Badge swinging. He felt light. Terribly, dangerously light. \n\n\"One HP,\" he whispered to himself, looking at a translucent green blob wobbling in the distance. \"Well. Better not miss.\"\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n  \"characters\": {\n
