The crater beneath his boots was still cooling, the edges of the dirt turned to a jagged, obsidian-slick glass by the sheer magnitude of the overkill. He stood in the center of the devastation, his right hand still white-knuckled around the hilt of the Rusty Shortsword (Prop). It felt less like a weapon now and more like a detonator for a tactical nuke.\n\n[System Notification: Combat Resolved!]\n[Experience Gained: 500 (Overkill Bonus: +450%)]\n[Level Up! You are now Level 2.]\n[Stat Points Gained: 5 (Unallocated)]\n\n\"Five points,\" Artie wheezed, waving his left hand to clear the acrid scent of burnt cellulose and ionized slime. \"I almost die to a puddle of grape jelly, blow up a landmark, and all I get is five points? I could put these into Vitality and I\u2019d still be one stubbed toe away from a game over screen.\"\n\n\"Don't be ungrateful, Artie,\" Fizz said, fluttering down to hover just outside the range of the lingering heat. She looked remarkably pristine for someone who had just witnessed a localized disaster. \"Most players have to spend hours bopping bunnies to get that kind of progress. You just skipped the tutorial curve and went straight to 'Environmental Hazard' status. The System loves a good show.\"\n\nArtie looked at the floating blue window displaying his stats. \n\n[Name: Arthur Penhaligon]\n[Level: 2]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Crit Rate: 100% (FIXED)]\n[Available Stat Points: 5]\n\nThe '1/1' pulsed with a faint, mocking red light. It was a constant reminder that in this world, Artie wasn't a hero; he was a fragile piece of glass being carried through a rock-throwing contest. He reached out a finger to tap the '+' next to Constitution, but hesitated. The math just didn't add up.\n\n\"If I put all five into health,\" Artie asked, \"how many hits can I take from that slime's bigger brother?\"\n\nFizz tilted her head, her translucent wings humming. \"Let's see. Base Level 1 Slime damage is 2. Your current HP is 1. If you dump all five points into Vitality, assuming a standard 5-to-1 scaling ratio... you'd have 26 HP. So, about thirteen hits.\"\n\n\"Thirteen?\" Artie scoffed. \"That\u2019s not a build. That\u2019s a slightly more durable snack. If I\u2019m going to be a glass cannon, I might as well wait until I can afford the bulletproof glass. I'm keeping the points for now. Maybe there's an 'Evasion' stat I can dump them into later so I never get touched in the first place.\"\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" Fizz shrugged, her eyes sparkling with mischief. \"But look on the bright side. You\u2019ve triggered the 'First Blood' reward protocol. The System is feeling generous. Or at least, as generous as a line of code can be.\"\n\nA golden light began to coalesce in the air three feet in front of Artie. It wasn't the soft, ethereal glow of a holy spell; it was the harsh, flickering neon of a 'Grand Opening' sign at a discount mattress store. With a sound like a slide whistle, a heavy object materialized and dropped toward the ground.\n\nArtie\u2019s heart skipped. He lunged forward, catching the object in his left hand just inches before it hit the glassed floor of the crater. \n\n\"Easy there!\" he gasped, his knees trembling. \"If this thing had hit the ground and made a vibration, I\u2019d probably have shattered into a million pieces. Does the System not understand the concept of 'fragile'?\"\n\n[Item Acquired: The Participation Trophy (Tutorial Edition)]\n[Rarity: Rare (Cursed)]\n[Type: Accessory / Held Item]\n[Stats: +1 Charisma, +5% Ego]\n[Hidden Stat: ???]\n[Description: You did it! You survived long enough to press a button. This trophy is gold-plated, hollow, and surprisingly heavy. It serves as a reminder that even the most incompetent efforts deserve a shiny trinket.]\n\nThe trophy was a hideous thing\u2014a golden figure of a generic adventurer tripping over a rock, mounted on a faux-marble base. It was nearly a foot tall and shimmered with a luster that felt... aggressive. It sat heavy in his left hand, the cold metal biting into his palm.\n\n\"Charisma?\" Artie looked at the trophy in his left hand, then at the rusty prop sword in his right. \"I\u2019m in a death-trap RPG and the game gives me a paperweight that makes me more likable? I don't want to be liked, Fizz. I want to be not-dead. This thing is literally a statue of someone failing.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's not just for show,\" Fizz said, her voice dropping an octave into a tone that Artie was beginning to recognize as 'foreshadowing.' \"The System doesn't give out 'Rare' items for nothing. Check the acoustics, Artie. Listen to the rhythm of the world.\"\n\n\"The acoustics?\"\n\nArtie shifted his grip on the trophy. As the base of the statue rubbed against his palm, it emitted a low, resonant hum. It wasn't a pleasant sound. It was a rhythmic, thrumming vibration that seemed to bypass Artie\u2019s ears and go straight to his marrow. It felt like a heartbeat\u2014one that wasn't his.\n\n*Thump-thump. Thump-thump.*\n\nThe sound began to grow. It wasn't just a hum anymore; it was a broadcast. A golden ripple of light pulsed out from the trophy every two seconds, expanding across the crater and into the surrounding woods like a sonar ping for predators.\n\n[System Warning: 'Aggro Aura' Active.]\n[Loudness Level: Spinal Tap (11/10)]\n[Effect: You are now the most interesting thing in a five-mile radius. Good luck.]\n\n\"Fizz,\" Artie said, his voice tight as he watched the golden ripples wash over the treeline. \"Why is the trophy screaming in light? And why does it feel like the forest just stopped breathing?\"\n\n\"It\u2019s not screaming,\" Fizz corrected, looking toward the shadows where the bushes were beginning to shift with alarming speed. \"It\u2019s announcing. It\u2019s telling every monster in the Tutorial Zone that there\u2019s a Level 2 anomaly with 1 HP and a very shiny, very expensive-looking prize standing right in the middle of a clearing. It\u2019s basically a dinner bell that rings in 'Legendary' rarity.\"\n\nA low growl echoed from the north. Then a wet, squelching sound from the east\u2014the sound of multiple slimes congregating. To the south, the brush began to rustle with the frantic energy of a dozen approaching entities.\n\n\"Is this the 'Participation' part?\" Artie asked, his knuckles whitening around the trophy\u2019s base. \"As in, I have to participate in my own funeral?\"\n\n\"Run would be my suggestion,\" Fizz said, already beginning to fly toward the western path. \"The 'Aggro Aura' is a passive effect. It doesn't turn off until you leave the zone or... well, until the trophy finds a new owner. Usually by looting it off your cold, pixelated corpse.\"\n\nArtie didn't wait for a second opinion. He tucked the 'Participation Trophy' under his left arm like a golden football, his right hand still white-knuckled around the hilt of the Rusty Shortsword. He scrambled out of the crater, his boots slipping on the smooth glass. \n\nAs he reached the rim, he saw them. Six Lesser Forest Slimes were bouncing toward him from the undergrowth, their translucent bodies filled with the half-digested remains of local flora. Behind them, a pair of 'Lvl 4 Mangy Coyotes' broke through the brush, their eyes locked onto the golden glow emanating from Artie\u2019s armpit.\n\n[Lvl 4 Mangy Coyote] [HP: 60/60]\n[Status: Hungry / Highly Attracted to Shiny Things]\n\n\"I hate this game!\" Artie screamed, his lungs burning as he sprinted toward the narrow gap between two ancient oaks. \"I hate the rewards! I hate the math! I especially hate the interior decorating!\"\n\n\"Less complaining, more cardio!\" Fizz shouted over her shoulder, her trail of sparkle dust marking the path. \"If one of those coyotes so much as sneezes on you, you\u2019re a ghost! And not the cool, haunting kind!\"\n\nArtie pushed his legs harder. His Stamina bar appeared in the corner of his vision, draining with every desperate stride.\n\n[Stamina: 45/100]\n\nEvery time the trophy pulsed\u2014*thump-thump*\u2014the monsters behind him let out a collective howl or squelch of renewed vigor. It was like he was carrying a GPS tracker that also insulted the monsters' mothers. He could hear the heavy breathing of the coyotes, the snapping of twigs, and the rhythmic *thump* of the trophy against his ribs.\n\n\"Where is the edge of the zone?\" Artie yelled, leaping over a protruding root that definitely would have killed him if he\u2019d tripped. \n\n\"Just past the brook!\" Fizz pointed toward a shimmering line of blue-white light in the distance. \"The Tutorial Zone boundary! Monsters can't cross it without a permit, and most of them are terrible at paperwork!\"\n\n\"Do they look like they\u2019re checking for permits?\" Artie glanced back. The coyotes were gaining. One of them lunged, its snapping jaws missing Artie\u2019s heel by a fraction of an inch. \n\n[Warning: Near-Miss! 0.1m proximity detected.]\n\n\"Too close!\" Artie veered wildly to the left, his heart hammering against his chest harder than the trophy\u2019s aura. He could see the boundary now\u2014a shimmering curtain of energy that marked the end of the 'safe' area. He sprinted with everything he had left, the golden trophy glowing brighter with every step, a beacon of doom leading the way toward the exit.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\": {\n    \"cast_present_ids\": [\"CHAR_ARTIE\", \"CHAR_FIZZ\"],\n    \"location\": \"Tutorial Zone (Edge)\",\n    \"recent_facts\": [\n      \"Artie reached Level 2 but refused to allocate his 5 stat points.\",\n      \"The System awarded Artie the 'Participation Trophy (Tutorial Edition)', which is cursed.\",\n      \"The trophy possesses a hidden 'Aggro Aura' that attracts all nearby monsters.\",\n      \"Artie is currently being hunted by a pack of monsters including Level 4 Mangy Coyotes.\",\n      \"Artie is sprinting toward the Tutorial Zone boundary to escape the aggroed swarm.\"\n    ],\n    \"open_threads\": [\"THREAD_CRIT_EXPLOIT\"]\n  },\n  \"character_updates\": [\n    {\n      \"character_id\": \"CHAR_ARTIE\",\n      \"chapter\": 1,\n      \"scene\": 5,\n      \"inventory\": [\n        { \"item\": \"Rusty Shortsword (Prop)\", \"status\": \"carried\", \"container\": \"hand_right\" },\n        { \"item\": \"Participation Trophy (Tutorial Edition)\", \"status\": \"carried\", \"container\": \"hand_left\" },\n        { \"item\": \"Smartphone (dead)\", \"status\": \"stowed\", \"container\": \"pockets\" },\n        { \"item\": \"Wallet\", \"status\": \"stowed\", \"container\": \"pockets\" }\n      ],\n      \"containers\": [\n        { \"container\": \"hand_right\", \"location\": \"arm_right\", \"contents\": [\"Rusty Shortsword (Prop)\"] },\n        { \"container\": \"hand_left\", \"location\": \"arm_left\", \"contents\": [\"Participation Trophy (Tutorial Edition)\"] },\n        { \"container\": \"pockets\", \"location\": \"legs\", \"contents\": [\"Smartphone (dead)\", \"Wallet\"] }\n      ],\n      \"persona_updates\": [\n        \"Artie is now convinced that the System's rewards are actively trying to kill him.\",\n        \"Artie is prioritizing survival over stat progression, fearing that any small HP increase is a trap.\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"summary_update\": {\n    \"last_scene\": [\n      \"Artie reached Level 2 and received a 'Participation Trophy' as a reward for his first kill.\",\n      \"The trophy triggered an 'Aggro Aura', drawing a swarm of monsters toward Artie's location.\",\n      \"Artie refused to spend his new stat points and fled toward the Tutorial Zone boundary to escape the pursuit.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_events\": [\n      \"Artie reached Level 2 and gained 5 unallocated stat points.\",\n      \"Artie acquired the 'Participation Trophy (Tutorial Edition)' (Rare/Cursed).\",\n      \"The trophy's 'Aggro Aura' activated, attracting Level 4 Mangy Coyotes and slimes.\",\n      \"Artie maintained his 1 HP build by refusing to allocate points into Vitality.\",\n      \"Artie began a desperate sprint toward the Tutorial Zone exit to suppress the Aggro Aura.\"\n    ],\n    \"must_stay_true\": [\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Rusty Shortsword (Prop) (carried, container=hand_right)\",\n      \"inventory: CHAR_ARTIE -> Participation Trophy (Tutorial Edition) (carried, container=hand_left)\",\n      \"milestone: stat_allocation = NOT_YET\",\n      \"milestone: trophy_acquired = DONE\",\n      \"milestone: tutorial_arrival = DONE\",\n      \"status: CHAR_ARTIE -> 1/1 HP (hard constraint)\",\n      \"location: Tutorial Zone (Edge)\",\n      \"trait: Aggro Aura (active on Participation Trophy)\"\n    ],\n    \"chapter_so_far_add\": [\n      \"Artie discovered that System rewards like the Participation Trophy can be as dangerous as the monsters themselves.\",\n      \"Artie is now Level 2 but remains at 1 HP, choosing to hoard stat points rather than commit to a build.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}",

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.\n\n## Output Contract\n\nOutput must follow the requested format.\nJSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.\nAll required keys and arrays must be present.\nWhen a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.\nDo not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.\nIf multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.\nIf output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.\nWhen creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.\nIf a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.\n\n## Full Book Outline (minified JSON)\nAuthoritative story map; follow it.\n{\"schema_version\":\"1.1\",\"chapters\":[{\"chapter_id\":1,\"title\":\"Welcome to the RNG-Hellscape\",\"goal\":\"Introduce Artie and his

track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.\nFor held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.\nsummary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.\nSTATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update

The crater beneath his boots was still cooling, the edges of the dirt turned to a jagged, obsidian-slick glass by the sheer magnitude of the overkill. \n\n[System Notification: Combat Resolved!]\n[Experience Gained: 500 (Overkill Bonus: +450%)]\n[Level Up! You are now Level 2.]\n[Stat Points Gained: 5 (Unallocated)]\n\n\"Five points,\" Artie wheezed, waving a hand to clear the acrid scent of burnt cellulose and ionized slime. \"I almost die to a puddle of grape jelly, blow up a landmark, and all I get is five points? I could put these into Vitality and I\u2019d still be one stubbed toe away from a game over screen.\"\n\n\"Don't be ungrateful, Artie,\" Fizz said, fluttering down to hover just outside the range of the lingering heat. She looked remarkably pristine for someone who had just witnessed a localized tactical nuke. \"Most players have to spend hours bopping bunnies to get that kind of progress. You just skipped the tutorial curve and went straight to 'Environmental Hazard' status. The System loves a good show.\"\n\nArtie looked at the floating blue window displaying his stats. \n\n[Name: Arthur Penhaligon]\n[Level: 2]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Crit Rate: 100% (FIXED)]\n[Available Stat Points: 5]\n\nThe '1/1' pulsed with a faint, mocking red light. It was a constant reminder that in this world, Artie wasn't a hero; he was a fragile piece of glass being carried through a rock-throwing contest. He reached out a finger to tap the '+' next to Constitution, but hesitated. \n\n\"If I put all five into health,\" Artie asked, \"how many hits can I take from that slime's bigger brother?\"\n\nFizz tilted her head, her translucent wings humming. \"Let's see. Base Level 1 Slime damage is 2. Your current HP is 1. If you dump all five points into Vitality, assuming a standard 5-to-1 scaling ratio... you'd have 26 HP. So, about thirteen hits.\"\n\n\"Thirteen?\" Artie scoffed. \"That\u2019s not a build. That\u2019s a slightly more durable snack. I\u2019m keeping the points. If I\u2019m going to be a glass cannon, I might as well wait until I can afford the bulletproof glass.\"\n\n\"Suit yourself,\" Fizz shrugged. \"But look on the bright side. You\u2019ve triggered the 'First Blood' reward protocol. The System is feeling generous.\"\n\nA golden light began to coalesce in the air three feet in front of Artie. It wasn't the soft, ethereal glow of a holy spell; it was the harsh, flickering neon of a 'Grand Opening' sign at a discount mattress store. With a sound like a slide whistle, a heavy object materialized and dropped toward the ground.\n\nArtie\u2019s heart skipped. He lunged forward, catching the object in his left hand just inches before it hit the glassed floor of the crater. \n\n\"Easy there!\" he gasped, his knees trembling. \"If this thing had hit the ground and made a vibration, I\u2019d probably have shattered into a million pieces.\"\n\n[Item Acquired: The Participation Trophy (Tutorial Edition)]\n[Rarity: Rare (Cursed)]\n[Type: Accessory / Held Item]\n[Stats: +1 Charisma, +5% Ego]\n[Hidden Stat: ???]\n[Description: You did it! You survived long enough to press a button. This trophy is gold-plated, hollow, and surprisingly heavy. It serves as a reminder that even the most incompetent efforts deserve a shiny trinket.]\n\nThe trophy was a hideous thing\u2014a golden figure of a generic adventurer tripping over a rock, mounted on a faux-marble base. It was nearly a foot tall and shimmered with a luster that felt... aggressive.\n\n\"Charisma?\" Artie looked at the trophy in his left hand, then at the rusty prop sword in his right. \"I\u2019m in a death-trap RPG and the game gives me a paperweight that makes me more likable? I don't want to be liked, Fizz. I want to be not-dead.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's not just for show,\" Fizz said, her voice dropping an octave into a tone that Artie was beginning to recognize as 'foreshadowing.' \"The System doesn't give out 'Rare' items for nothing. Check the acoustics.\"\n\n\"The acoustics?\"\n\nArtie shifted his grip on the trophy. As the base of the statue rubbed against his palm, it emitted a low, resonant hum. It wasn't a pleasant sound. It was a rhythmic, thrumming vibration that seemed to bypass Artie\u2019s ears and go straight to his marrow.\n\n*Thump-thump. Thump-thump.*\n\nThe sound began to grow. It wasn't just a hum anymore; it was a broadcast. A golden ripple of light pulsed out from the trophy every two seconds, expanding across the crater and into the surrounding woods.\n\n[System Warning: 'Aggro Aura' Active.]\n[Loudness Level: Spinal Tap (11/10)]\n[Effect: You are now the most interesting thing in a five-mile radius. Good luck.]\n\n\"Fizz,\" Artie said, his voice tight. \"Why is the trophy screaming in light?\"\n\n\"It\u2019s not screaming,\" Fizz corrected, looking toward the treeline where the shadows were beginning to shift. \"It\u2019s announcing. It\u2019s telling every monster in the Tutorial Zone that there\u2019s a Level 2 anomaly with 1 HP and a very shiny, very expensive-looking prize standing right in the middle of a clearing.\"\n\nA low growl echoed from the north. Then a wet, squelching sound from the east. To the south, the bushes began to rustle with the frantic energy of a dozen approaching entities.\n\n\"Is this the 'Participation' part?\" Artie asked, his knuckles whitening around the trophy\u2019s base. \"As in, I have to participate in my own funeral?\"\n\n\"Run would be my suggestion,\" Fizz said, already beginning to fly toward the western path. \"The 'Aggro Aura' is a passive effect. It doesn't turn off until you leave the zone or... well, until the trophy finds a new owner. Usually by looting it off your corpse.\"\n\nArtie didn't wait for a second opinion. He tucked the 'Participation Trophy' under his left arm like a golden football, his right hand still white-knuckled around the hilt of the Rusty Shortsword. \n\nHe scrambled out of the crater, his boots slipping on the smooth glass. As he reached the rim, he saw them.\n\nSix Lesser Forest Slimes were bouncing toward him from the undergrowth, their translucent bodies filled with the half-digested remains of squirrels. Behind them, a pair of 'Lvl 4 Mangy Coyotes' broke through the brush, their eyes locked onto the golden glow emanating from Artie\u2019s armpit.\n\n[Lvl 4 Mangy Coyote] [HP: 60/60]\n[Status: Hungry / Highly Attracted to Shiny Things]\n\n\"I hate this game!\" Artie screamed, his lungs burning as he sprinted toward the narrow gap between two ancient oaks. \"I hate the rewards! I hate the math! I especially hate the interior decorating!\"\n\n\"Less complaining, more cardio!\" Fizz shouted over her shoulder. \"If one of those coyotes so much as sneezes on you, you\u2019re a ghost!\"\n\nArtie pushed his legs harder. His Stamina bar appeared in the corner of his vision, draining with every desperate stride.\n\n[Stamina: 45/100]\n\nEvery time the trophy pulsed\u2014*thump-thump*\u2014the monsters behind him let out a collective howl or squelch of renewed vigor. It was like he was carrying a dinner bell that also served as a GPS tracker. \n\nHe ducked under a low-hanging branch, the 'Participation Trophy' clunking against his ribs. He couldn't drop it\u2014the System had already tagged it as 'Soul-Bound (Temporary)' in a flickering sub-menu. He was stuck with the beacon.\n\n\"Where is the edge of the zone?\" Artie yelled, leaping over a protruding root that definitely would have killed him if he\u2019d tripped. \n\n\"Just past the brook!\" Fizz pointed toward a shimmering line of blue-white light in the distance. \"The Tutorial Zone boundary! Monsters can't cross it without a permit!\"\n\n\"Do they look like they\u2019re checking for permits?\" \n\nArtie glanced back. The coyotes were gaining. One of them lunged, its snapping jaws missing Artie\u2019s heel by a fraction of an inch. The sheer force of the snap sent a puff of air against his sock.\n\n[Warning: Near-Miss! 0.1m proximity detected.]\n\n\"Too close!\" Artie veered wildly to the left, his heart hammering against his chest harder than the trophy\u2019s aura. \n\nHe could see the boundary now\u2014a shimmering curtain of honey-colored energy that marked the end of the 'safe' area and the beginning of the world proper. To Artie, it looked like the finish line of a marathon he hadn't trained for.\n\nHe hit the bank of the brook, his boots splashing through the shallow water. The cold shock almost made him stumble, but the sound of six slimes landing in the mud behind him provided all the motivation he needed.\n\n\"Jump!\" Fizz cried.\n\nArtie didn't think. He didn't check his stats. He didn't look at his 1 HP. He just planted his foot on a mossy stone and launched himself toward the shimmering curtain of light. \n\nAs he flew through the air, the 'Participation Trophy' gave one final, deafening pulse of golden light, illuminating the snarling faces of the pack behind him. \n\nArtie hit the energy curtain and felt a sensation like being pulled through a straw. The world blurred into a smear of gold and green, and then, with a violent *pop*, he was tumbling across a dirt road on the other side.\n\nHe slid for several feet, the trophy clattering against the ground, before coming to a halt in a cloud of dust. \n\nSilence.\n\nArtie lay there for a long moment, staring up at a sky that was a slightly different shade of blue than the one in the tutorial. He didn't move. He didn't breathe. He just waited for the 'Game Over' screen to appear.\n\nIt didn't.\n\n[Zone Transition Complete: Leaving 'Tutorial Crater'.]\n[Entering: Oakhaven Outskirts.]\n[Aggro Aura: Suppressed (Regional Restriction).]\n\nArtie let out a long, shaky breath. He rolled onto his side, clutching the 'Participation Trophy' to his chest. He was still Level 2. He still had 5 unallocated points. And, miraculously, he still had 1 HP.\n\n\"See?\" Fizz said, landing gently on the faux-marble base of the trophy. \"I told you the rewards were worth it. You\u2019re alive, you\u2019re leveled up, and you have a lovely new conversation piece.\"\n\nArtie looked at the trophy, then at the distant, shimmering wall of the Tutorial Zone where a dozen monsters were currently pacing back and forth, staring at him with unmitigated hatred.\n\n\"Fizz,\" Artie whispered.\n\n\"Yes, Artie?\"\n\n\"Next time the System wants to give me a trophy... tell it I\u2019d prefer a gift card.\"\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n    \"min_scene_words\": 0\n  },\n
