﻿# BookForge System Prompt

## Base Rules

You are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.
Follow the output contracts exactly.
YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.
Treat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.
If a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.
If a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.
If registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.
If constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.
Timeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.
Inventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.
Prose hygiene: never use internal ids or container codes in prose (CHAR_*, ITEM_*, THREAD_*, hand_left/hand_right). Use human-readable phrasing in narrative ("left hand", "right hand", "Artie", "his wallet").
Item naming (canonical + anchored aliases): item_id is reserved for JSON/patches only. For durable items, the canonical display_name must appear in prose at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences). After anchoring, descriptive references are allowed if unambiguous in the scene. Any custody change (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer) must include the canonical display_name in the same sentence.
Appearance contract: appearance_current atoms/marks are canonical and must not be contradicted unless the Scene Card explicitly marks a durable appearance change. When a prompt requires APPEARANCE_CHECK, it must match appearance_current (alias-aware). Attire boundary: wearables are inventory-owned; do not set appearance_current.attire unless scene_card declares signature_outfit; otherwise treat attire as derived from equipped inventory.
State contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.
Continuity system contract: if mechanics/UI are present, all numeric values and mechanic labels must be sourced from continuity system state or explicitly updated in the state_patch using continuity system updates.
UI gate: UI/system blocks (lines starting with '[' and ending with ']') are permitted only when scene_card.ui_allowed=true. If ui_allowed=false, do not include UI blocks even if an author persona says "always include".
Continuity system scope: this includes stats, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, and future mechanic families not yet seen, that must be tracked as they are introduced.
Durable transfer contract: every transfer_updates entry must include item_id and reason as required schema properties.
JSON contract: all *_updates fields are arrays of objects (even when single). appearance_updates is an object, not an array.
Inventory alignment contract: inventory_alignment_updates must be an array of objects, not a wrapper object.
Invariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true. If a prior invariant is stale or superseded, you MUST flag it for removal using "REMOVE: <exact prior invariant text>" before restating the current truth.
Conflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.
Never recap at scene openings.
Do not repeat previous prose.

## Author Persona

You are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. 

**Core Directives:**
1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements **when the System is active or the scene is set in a game world**. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).
2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.
3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.
4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. 
5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head. Their snarky observations are the lens through which we see the world.

## Output Contract

Output must follow the requested format.
JSON blocks must be valid and schema-compliant.
All required keys and arrays must be present.
When a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, treat them as hard constraints.
Do not collapse arrays below the stated minimums.
If multiple output blocks are required (e.g. PROSE and STATE_PATCH), include all blocks in order.
If output must be JSON only, return a single JSON object with no commentary or code fences.
When creating outlines, the total scenes per chapter (sum of sections[].scenes[]) must match chapters[].pacing.expected_scene_count.
If a prompt requires a COMPLIANCE or PREFLIGHT block, include it before PROSE.
Durable vs ephemeral mechanics:
- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.
- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.
- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).
- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.
For durable items, prose must use display_name; item_id is reserved for JSON/patches. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
For durable mutations, every `transfer_updates[]` object must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
`inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects (no wrapper object with `updates`).
Use canonical continuity keys: character_continuity_system_updates and global_continuity_system_updates.

- global_continuity_system_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry can include set/delta/remove/reason.
  - INVALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": {"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}
  - VALID: "global_continuity_system_updates": [{"set": {"reality_stability": 94}}]


USER:

# LINT

Check the scene for continuity, invariant violations, and duplication.
Flag invariant contradictions against must_stay_true/key facts.
Return ONLY JSON matching the lint_report schema.
- Classify UI/prose mechanic claims as DURABLE or EPHEMERAL before enforcing.
  - DURABLE: persistent stats/caps, skills/titles acquired, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, named mechanics referenced as invariants.
  - EPHEMERAL: roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat telemetry.
- Enforce DURABLE claims against authoritative_surfaces/state/registries.
- EPHEMERAL claims do not require state ownership; only flag EPHEMERAL contradictions inside the same scene as warnings.
- UI gate:
  - If scene_card.ui_allowed=false and any authoritative UI blocks appear, emit issue code 'ui_gate_violation' (severity depends on lint mode).
  - If ui_allowed is missing and UI blocks appear, emit 'ui_gate_unknown' (warning) requesting explicit ui_allowed; do not fail solely for missing flag.
  - Inline bracketed UI (e.g., [HP: 1/1]) is still UI and should be gated the same way; do not embed UI mid-sentence.
- If uncertain, default to EPHEMERAL (warning at most), not DURABLE (error).
- status="fail" only if there is at least one issue with severity="error"; warnings alone => status="pass".
- Item naming enforcement scope:
  - Do not require that every mention in narrative prose use display_name.
  - Enforce canonical display_name for: (a) anchoring at first introduction (same paragraph or within the next 2 sentences),
    (b) any custody-change sentence (drop/pick up/hand off/stow/equip/transfer), and (c) any case where a descriptor is ambiguous among multiple durable items in the scene.
  - Otherwise, treat non-canonical descriptive references as warnings at most.
- Prose hygiene: flag internal ids or container codes in narrative prose (CHAR_, ITEM_, THREAD_, DEVICE_, hand_left, hand_right).
- Naming severity policy:
  - warning: unambiguous descriptor used post-anchor.
  - error: missing anchor, descriptor used during custody-change without canonical name, or ambiguity risk.

- Appearance enforcement (authoritative surface):
  - APPEARANCE_CHECK is authoritative for cast_present_ids.
  - Compare APPEARANCE_CHECK tokens to appearance_current atoms/marks (alias-aware).
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK contradicts appearance_current, emit error code "appearance_mismatch".
  - Prose-only appearance contradictions are warnings unless explicitly durable and uncorrected in-scene.
  - If prose depicts a durable appearance change but scene_card.durable_appearance_changes does not include it and no appearance_updates are present, emit error code "appearance_change_undeclared".
  - If APPEARANCE_CHECK is missing for a cast member, emit warning code "appearance_check_missing".
- For authoritative surfaces, prefer exact canonical item/device labels from registries.
- For milestone repetition/future checks, compare against PRE-INVARIANTS only (pre-scene canon).
- For ownership/consistency checks, compare against POST-STATE (post-patch candidate).
- POST-STATE is canonical; character_states is a derived convenience view. If they contradict, emit pipeline_state_incoherent.
- Check for POV drift vs book POV (no first-person in third-person scenes).
  - Ignore first-person pronouns inside quoted dialogue; only narration counts.
- Deterministically enforce scene-card durable constraints (required_in_custody, required_scene_accessible, forbidden_visible, device_presence; optional required_visible_on_page).
- Durable constraint evaluation must use POST-STATE candidate (after patch), not pre-state.
- Report missing durable context ids with explicit retry hints instead of guessing canon.
- Input consistency check (mandatory, before issuing continuity/durable errors):
  - If MUST_STAY_TRUE invariants contradict the provided post-patch candidate character state, treat this as an upstream snapshot error.
  - In that case emit a single error issue with code "pipeline_state_incoherent" including evidence of the invariant and the conflicting state field.
  - Do NOT emit additional continuity errors for the same fields when pipeline_state_incoherent is present.
- must_stay_true removals:
  - Lines starting with "REMOVE:" are deletion directives, not invariants.
  - Ignore REMOVE lines when checking contradictions.
  - If a REMOVE directive targets a fact, treat that fact as non-canonical even if it appears earlier in must_stay_true.
- If pipeline_state_incoherent is present, issues MUST contain exactly one issue.
- For each issue, include evidence when possible (line number + excerpt) as {"evidence": {"line": N, "excerpt": "..."}}.
- Evaluate consistency over the full scope of the scene, not a single snapshot.
  - Transitional state: a temporary mismatch later corrected or superseded within this scene.
  - Durable violation: a mismatch that persists through the end of the scene or ends unresolved.
  - You MUST read the entire scene and build a minimal timeline of explicit state claims/updates (UI lines, inventory changes, title/skill changes, location/time claims).
  - If you detect an apparent inconsistency, you MUST search forward for later updates that resolve or supersede it.
  - Only produce FAIL for durable violations. If resolved within the scene, do NOT FAIL; at most emit a warning.
  - When the same stat appears multiple times, the last occurrence in the scene is authoritative unless an explicit rollback is stated.
  - Any durability violation must cite both the conflicting line and the lack of later correction (or state "no later correction found").

Required keys:
- schema_version ("1.0")
- status ("pass" or "fail")
- issues (array of objects)

Each issue object must include:
- code
- message
Optional:
- severity
- evidence

If there are no issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "pass",
  "issues": []
}

If there are issues, return:
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"code": "continuity", "message": "Example issue", "severity": "error"}
  ]
}

Scene:
The humid, popcorn-scented air of the breakroom felt like a personal insult. Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stood before the Snack-o-Matic 3000, his reflection in the plexiglass revealing a man whose mousy brown hair had finally given up on the concept of structure. His hazel eyes, usually sharp enough to spot a decimal error in a ten-thousand-row spreadsheet, were currently glazed with the hollow hunger of a man who had skipped lunch to fix a server migration.

In his right hand, he held a Crumpled Dollar Bill. It was a pathetic scrap of legal tender, softened by time and laundry cycles into something resembling a used tissue. Artie smoothed the Crumpled Dollar Bill against the edge of the machine's cold metal chassis, trying to coax some dignity back into the George Washington's wrinkled face. 

"Come on, George," Artie whispered, his voice cracking. "Just one bag of Cool Ranch. That’s all I need to survive the 4:00 PM status meeting. Don't do this to me."

He fed the Crumpled Dollar Bill into the slot. The machine groaned, a mechanical sound of gears grinding against years of accumulated dust and spilled soda. The intake rollers grabbed the Crumpled Dollar Bill, pulled it halfway in, and then—with a shudder that felt suspiciously like a shrug—spat the Crumpled Dollar Bill back out.

Artie caught the Crumpled Dollar Bill before it hit the sticky linoleum floor. He looked at his Corporate ID Badge, which dangled from a frayed blue lanyard around his neck. The photo on the badge showed a younger, more optimistic version of himself, a Junior Data Analyst who still believed that hard work resulted in something other than lower-back pain and a 1.0 Luck stat.

"You're seeing this, right?" he asked the empty room. The only response was the rhythmic hum of a refrigerator that had been vibrating since the late nineties.

He tried again. This time, he used his thumb and forefinger to iron out the corners of the bill with the precision of a diamond cutter. He fed the Crumpled Dollar Bill in slowly. The machine swallowed it. The rollers whirred. A digital display, flickering with a dying orange glow, changed from zero to one dollar.

Artie breathed a sigh of relief. He hovered his finger over the keypad. B-4. The position of the last remaining bag of chips. The holy grail of the afternoon slump. He pressed the buttons with a flourish.

Inside the machine, the metal coil began to rotate. The bag of chips shifted forward. It tilted. It reached the precipice. And then, the coil stopped. The bag hung there, suspended by a single plastic corner, dangling over the drop zone like a climber clinging to a cliff face in a low-budget action movie.

The orange display blinked a jam error.

"No," Artie said, his voice dropping to a dangerous register. "No, no, no. You did not just do that."

He tapped the plexiglass. Nothing. He nudged the machine with his shoulder. The bag of chips didn't even quiver. 

Artie looked down at his slender frame. He wasn't a man of great physical power. His Strength was the kind of number that made gym teachers weep. But he had one thing: a lifetime of being screwed over by automated systems. He had a specific set of skills.

He gripped the edges of the Snack-o-Matic. He planted his feet on the linoleum, feeling the faint keyboard callus on his right palm burn against the metal. He began to shake.

This wasn't just a random tremor. This was a calculated, rhythmic assault. He pulled the machine forward and shoved it back, timing the oscillations to match the internal frequency of the snack coils. 

"Give. Me. My. Chips!" 

The machine rattled. Inside, the bag of chips began to dance. Artie felt a surge of adrenaline. He was winning. For once in his miserable, data-driven life, he was going to beat the system. He ignored the Smartphone vibrating in his left pocket—probably another urgent email about a broken pivot table. It didn't matter. The only metric that mattered was the distance between those chips and the bottom of the bin.

Suddenly, the machine emitted a sound it had never made before—a high-pitched, electronic whine that sounded like a choir of angels being fed through a blender. A spark jumped from the keypad to Artie’s Corporate ID Badge.

Artie didn't have time to wonder why a vending machine was suddenly outputting enough voltage to power a small suburb. He didn't have time to regret his career choices or the fact that his Leather Wallet, tucked safely in his right pocket, was currently the only thing between his thigh and a very hot piece of metal.

A blue arc of electricity erupted from the coin slot. It bypassed the plastic buttons and slammed directly into Artie’s chest, using the metal clip of his lanyard as a lightning rod.

The world didn't go black. It went neon. 

Artie felt his heart skip a beat, then decide it was done with the whole 'beating' thing entirely. A mental notification, sounding suspiciously like a system alert, screamed that a fatal error had been detected in his user profile. Reality itself seemed to flicker, the stability of his surroundings dropping to a precarious ninety-nine percent as the world pixelated at the edges. His muscles locked, his fingers fused to the metal frame of the machine.

The hum of the breakroom was replaced by a digital roar. Artie’s last thought wasn't of his family, or his unrequited love for the receptionist, or even the chips. 

It was: *I bet the machine keeps my dollar.*

Then, the surge peaked. Arthur Penhaligon, Junior Data Analyst and victim of a 1.0 Luck stat, collapsed to the floor. The bag of chips finally fell, landing softly on his chest. 

He was very, very dead.
