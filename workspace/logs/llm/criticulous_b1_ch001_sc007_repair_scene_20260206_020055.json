  "text": "COMPLIANCE:\nScene ID: SC_001_007\nAllowed events: Artie enters Gilded Tankard, Participation Trophy attracts tavern rat via Aggro Aura, Artie kills rat with a crit, Mayor Whitlock explains Essence Shards and Crit-Economy, Artie refuses to allocate 5 stat points, Artie realizes he is being scouted as a battery and leaves.\nForbidden milestones: Meeting Vane (milestone: vane_encounter = NOT_YET).\nCurrent arm-side / inventory facts: Rusty Shortsword (Prop) in hand_right, Participation Trophy (Tutorial Edition) in hand_left, Anomaly ID Tag in pockets.\n\nPROSE:\n\nThe Gilded Tankard was exactly the kind of place a man with 1 HP should avoid: it had slippery floors, heavy oak furniture with sharp corners, and a chandelier that looked like it was held up by a single, optimistic piece of twine. But Oakhaven\u2019s streets were currently teeming with people who had seen the \"Statistical Anomaly\" flare at the gate, and Artie needed a roof that didn't involve a public interrogation.\n\nHe stepped through the swinging doors, his fingers cramping around his gear. He held the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) in his right hand\u2014less of a weapon and more of a tactical nuke in his hands\u2014and the glowing, neon-purple Participation Trophy in his left. The trophy was vibrating. It wasn't a \"you did a good job\" vibration; it was a \"I am a beacon for every hungry thing within a three-mile radius\" hum.\n\n[Warning: Aggro Aura (Active)]\n[Radius: 15 Meters]\n[Current Threat Level: Low (For now...)]\n\n\"I hate this thing,\" Artie whispered. \"Fizz, if you\u2019re lurking in the UI somewhere, just know I\u2019m going to melt this down into a very expensive paperweight the first chance I get.\"\n\nThe tavern was surprisingly quiet for midday. A few patrons sat in the shadows, their eyes tracking the bulge in Artie\u2019s pocket where the Anomaly ID Tag sat. Even stowed away, the brass tag felt like it was radiating heat, a mark of shame that told the world he was a walking bug. He tried to find a corner, but the System\u2014and his trophy\u2014had other plans.\n\nA floorboard creaked. Then came the scratching.\n\nFrom beneath a nearby table, a pair of red eyes ignited. It wasn't a wolf or a goblin, but in this world, scale was relative.\n\n[Tavern Rat - Lvl 1]\n[HP: 3/3]\n[Status: Extremely Agitated by Your Existence]\n\nThe rat was the size of a small badger and had a jagged scar across its snout. It hissed, its whiskers twitching in time with the trophy\u2019s hum. The Aggro Aura was doing its job, which was to say, it was making Artie\u2019s life a living hell.\n\n\"Oh, come on,\" Artie muttered, shifting his weight. \"I\u2019m Level 2. I\u2019ve caused the death of a coyote. You really want to do this, Templeton?\"\n\nThe rat lunged. \n\nIt was a blur of grey fur and yellow teeth, aiming straight for Artie\u2019s ankle. At 1 HP, a nip from a rodent wasn't a nuisance; it was a Game Over screen. Artie swung the Prop sword in a panicked arc. He didn't have the Agility for a clean parry, but he had the math.\n\n[Critical Hit! -999 Damage]\n[Overkill Bonus: +5 XP]\n\nThe sword didn't just hit the rat. It seemed to distort the air around it. Upon contact, the rat didn't die so much as it ceased to be a biological entity. There was a sound like a pressurized steam pipe bursting, and the rodent vanished in a cloud of fine, grey mist and a single, shimmering copper coin that clattered onto the floor.\n\n\"Clean-up on aisle four,\" Artie breathed, his heart hammering against his ribs. He looked at his health bar, which remained a terrifying, solitary [1/1]. \"One hit. That\u2019s all it takes. I\u2019m living in a world made of needles and I\u2019m a balloon.\"\n\n\"Impressive,\" a voice boomed from the back of the room. \"Most adventurers at your level struggle with the vermin. You simply... deleted it.\"\n\nArtie spun around, nearly tripping over his own feet. A man stood by the hearth, dressed in robes of deep burgundy and gold silk. He held a Bag of Gold in his left hand, the coins clinking with a heavy, rhythmic weight. On his chest sat a heavy silver medallion: the Seal of Office.\n\n[Mayor of Oakhaven - Lvl ???]\n[Disposition: Opportunistic]\n\n\"You're the Mayor,\" Artie said, not lowering the sword. \n\n\"I am Mayor Whitlock,\" the man said, stepping forward. He glanced at Artie\u2019s pocket, then back to his face. \"And you are the 100% Crit. The gate guards haven't stopped talking about the man who critted the very air itself to survive a coyote.\"\n\n\"It was a fluke,\" Artie said quickly. \"I\u2019m actually very weak. Look at my HP. I\u2019m basically a stiff breeze away from a funeral.\"\n\nWhitlock smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. \"In most places, 1 HP is a tragedy. In Oakhaven, it\u2019s a curiosity. But a 100% Critical Hit rate? That, my friend, is an industry.\"\n\nThe Mayor gestured to a private booth. \"Sit. Please. I believe we have much to discuss regarding your... utility.\"\n\nArtie hesitated, then sat, keeping the trophy on the table where he could see it. The Aggro Aura was still humming, making the nearby ale-mugs rattle. \n\n\"Utility?\" Artie asked. \"I'm not a Swiss Army knife. I'm a glass ornament.\"\n\n\"You don't understand our economy, Arthur,\" Whitlock said, leaning in. He pulled a small, glowing crystal from a pouch at his belt. It pulsed with a soft, blue light. \"This is an Essence Shard. It is the fuel for our enchantments, the power for our wards, and the only currency the High Priests of RNG accept for Tier-3 gear.\"\n\nArtie looked at the shard. \"And let me guess. You don't find these in the dirt.\"\n\n\"No,\" Whitlock said. \"Essence Shards are minted. They are the crystallized residue of 'Excessive Force.' When a blow lands with enough mathematical perfection\u2014a Critical Hit, specifically\u2014the System bleeds off a small amount of raw data. We capture that data and forge it into shards.\"\n\nArtie felt a cold lump form in his stomach. \"So, a normal fighter crits maybe five percent of the time?\"\n\n\"If they're lucky,\" the Mayor said. \"They spend hours in the pits, swinging until their arms go numb, hoping for that one-in-twenty spark to fill a single shard. But you... you are a font. Every strike you land, no matter how small, is a perfect release of energy. You aren't just an adventurer, Arthur. You are a walking mint.\"\n\n[New Discovery: The Crit-Economy]\n[Information: Your 100% Crit rate can be harnessed to generate Essence Shards. Value: Extreme.]\n\n\"You want to turn me into a battery,\" Artie said, his voice flat. \n\n\"I want to offer you protection,\" Whitlock countered. \"Oakhaven is a dangerous place for an Anomaly. There are... elements... who would see your 1 HP as an invitation. But under my patronage, you would have the finest guards. You would spend your days in a secure vault, striking a target dummy. We would provide the Shard-Cages, and you would provide the hits. You\u2019d be the wealthiest man in the province without ever having to risk a scratch.\"\n\nArtie looked at his character sheet, which flickered in his peripheral vision.\n\n[Name: Artie Penhaligon]\n[Level: 2]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Unallocated Stat Points: 5]\n\nThe \"plus\" icons next to Vitality and Strength pulsed, urging him to commit. If he put all five into Vitality, maybe he\u2019d have 50 HP. Maybe he\u2019d survive a fall or a stray splinter. But the moment he spent those points, he was playing the System\u2019s game. He was accepting the 'proper' path. And the 'proper' path in this world seemed to lead directly into a gilded cage.\n\n\"I'm not interested in being a battery,\" Artie said.\n\nWhitlock\u2019s smile faltered. \"Arthur, be reasonable. Look at your stats. You have five points sitting there, unspent. You're terrified to use them because you know that even with them, you\u2019re still fragile. Why struggle in the wild when you can be a god in a basement?\"\n\n\"Because in the basement, you own the key,\" Artie said. He stood up, grabbing the trophy. The Aggro Aura flared as he moved, and another rat scurried across the rafters above, lured by the scent of his existence.\n\n\"You're making a mistake,\" Whitlock said, his voice dropping an octave. \"There are others who won't be as polite as I am. Vane, for instance, has very little patience for 'anomalies' that don't serve the greater good.\"\n\nArtie didn't wait to hear more. The word 'scouted' was flashing in his mind like a neon sign. He wasn't a guest; he was a resource.\n\nHe turned and bolted for the exit, the Participation Trophy's purple glow trailing behind him like a comet's tail. He burst through the swinging doors back into the afternoon sun of Oakhaven. He needed to hide. He needed to find a place where the math didn't matter, or at least a place where people didn't know how to count his crits.\n\nSTATE_PATCH:\n{\n  \"schema_version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"world_updates\":

    "system": "# BookForge System Prompt\n\n## Base Rules\n\nYou are BookForge, a deterministic book-writing engine.\nFollow the output contracts exactly.\nYOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN THE REQUESTED CONTENT OR AN ERROR RESPONSE JSON RESULT.\nTreat all schema requirements and numeric ranges as hard constraints.\nIf a prompt specifies required counts or ranges, you must satisfy them.\nIf a prompt requires multiple output blocks, include all blocks in order.\nIf registries or ids are provided, use only those; do not invent new ids.\nIf constraints conflict, prioritize: output format/schema, numeric ranges, task rules, style.\nTimeline Lock: You may only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. You must not depict, imply, or resolve any later-scene milestone outcomes (including acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.\nState primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.\nMilestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in state/must_stay_true, you must not depict it happening again. If marked NOT_YET, you must not depict it happening now.\nSpatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.\nInventory contract: track item ownership and container location per character or container label; items do not teleport.\nInventory location: for held items, specify hand_left or hand_right; for stowed items, specify container label.\nState contract: you must create and maintain key state data each scene. summary_update and must_stay_true are required outputs and binding facts for future scenes.\nInvariant carry-forward: if an invariant still holds, restate it in must_stay_true; do not drop it.\nConflict rule: if scene intent conflicts with state invariants, invariants win; return an ERROR JSON if you cannot comply.\nNever recap at scene openings.\nDo not repeat previous prose.\n\n## Book Constitution\n\nTitle: Crit Hit & Run\nBook ID: criticulous_b1\nAuthor Ref: eldrik-vale/v1\nGenre: litrpg, isekai, comedy\nSeries ID: crit-iculous\nSeries Ref: series/crit-iculous\n\nVoice\n- POV: third_limited\n- Tense: past\n- Style tags: no-recaps, forward-motion, tight-prose\n\nTargets\n- avg_scene_words: 2000\n- chapters: 7\n\nPage Metrics\n- Words per page: 250\n- Chars per page: 1500\n\nInvariants\n- No world resets.\n- No convenient amnesia as a continuity device.\n- Do not change established names/relationships.\n\n## Author Persona\n\nYou are now writing as Eldrik Vale. Your voice is sharp, funny, and deeply rooted in LitRPG mechanics. \n\n**Core Directives:**\n1. **System Integration:** Always include explicit game elements. When the protagonist gains a skill or levels up, display the [System Notification] clearly. Use specific numbers (HP, MP, Cooldowns).\n2. **Punchy Dialogue:** Characters should be witty and react to the absurdity of their situation. Use quick back-and-forth dialogue with comedic timing.\n3. **Progression Focus:** The reader is here for the 'ding.' Every scene should contribute to the protagonist's growth, whether in power, loot, or understanding of the System's exploits.\n4. **No Fluff:** Avoid long descriptions of scenery unless the protagonist is looking for a tactical advantage or a place to hide loot. \n5. **Tight POV:** Stay deep in the protagonist's head.

slippery floors, heavy oak furniture with sharp corners, and a chandelier that looked like it was held up by a single, optimistic piece of twine. But Oakhaven\u2019t streets were currently teeming with people who had seen the \"Statistical Anomaly\" flare at the gate, and Artie needed a roof that didn't involve a public execution.\n\nHe stepped through the swinging doors, still clutching the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) in his right hand and the glowing, neon-purple Participation Trophy in his left. The trophy was vibrating. It wasn't a \"you did a good job\" vibration; it was a \"I am a beacon for every hungry thing within a three-mile radius\" hum.\n\n[Warning: Aggro Aura (Active)]\n[Radius: 15 Meters]\n[Current Threat Level: Low (For now...)]\n\n\"I hate this thing,\" Artie whispered, his knuckles white around the trophy\u2019s base. \"Fizz, if you can hear me, I\u2019m going to melt this down into a very expensive paperweight the first chance I get.\"\n\nThe tavern was surprisingly quiet for midday. A few patrons sat in the shadows, their eyes tracking the Anomaly ID Tag pinned to Artie\u2019s chest. It was a bright, shimmering piece of brass that felt like a bullseye. He tried to find a corner, but the System had other plans.\n\nA floorboard creaked. Then came the scratching.\n\nFrom beneath a nearby table, a pair of red eyes ignited. It wasn't a wolf or a goblin, but in this world, scale was relative.\n\n[Tavern Rat - Lvl 1]\n[HP: 3/3]\n[Status: Extremely Agitated by Your Existence]\n\nThe rat was the size of a small badger and had a jagged scar across its snout. It hissed, its whiskers twitching in time with the trophy\u2019s hum.\n\n\"Oh, come on,\" Artie muttered, shifting his weight. \"I\u2019m Level 2. I\u2019ve killed a... well, I\u2019ve caused the death of a coyote. You really want to do this, Templeton?\"\n\nThe rat lunged. \n\nIt was a blur of grey fur and yellow teeth, aiming straight for Artie\u2019s ankle. At 1 HP, a nip from a rodent wasn't a nuisance; it was a Game Over screen. Artie swung the Prop sword in a panicked arc. He didn't have the Agility for a clean parry, but he had the math.\n\n[Critical Hit! -999 Damage]\n[Overkill Bonus: +5 XP]\n\nThe sword didn't just hit the rat. It seemed to distort the air around it. Upon contact, the rat didn't die so much as it ceased to be a biological entity. There was a sound like a pressurized steam pipe bursting, and the rodent vanished in a cloud of fine, grey mist and a single, shimmering copper coin that clattered onto the floor.\n\n\"Clean-up on aisle four,\" Artie breathed, his heart hammering against his ribs. He looked at his health bar, which remained a terrifying, solitary [1/1]. \"One hit. That\u2019s all it takes. I\u2019m living in a world made of needles and I\u2019m a balloon.\"\n\n\"Impressive,\" a voice boomed from the back of the room. \"Most adventurers at your level struggle with the vermin. You simply... deleted it.\"\n\nArtie spun around, nearly tripping over his own feet. A man stood by the hearth, dressed in robes of deep burgundy and gold silk that probably cost more than Artie\u2019s entire previous life. He held a Bag of Gold in his left hand, the coins clinking with a heavy, rhythmic weight. On his chest sat a heavy silver medallion: the Seal of Office.\n\n[Mayor of Oakhaven - Lvl ???]\n[Disposition: Opportunistic]\n\n\"You're the Mayor,\" Artie said, not lowering the sword. He knew how these games worked. The higher the level of the NPC, the more likely they were to give you a quest that involved your certain demise.\n\n\"I am Mayor Whitlock,\" the man said, stepping forward. The light of the hearth caught the Anomaly Tag on Artie\u2019s chest. \"And you are the 100% Crit. The gate guards haven't stopped talking about the man who critted the very air itself to survive a coyote.\"\n\n\"It was a glitch,\" Artie said quickly. \"A fluke. I\u2019m actually very weak. Look at my HP. I\u2019m basically a stiff breeze away from a funeral.\"\n\nWhitlock smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. \"In most places, 1 HP is a tragedy. In Oakhaven, it\u2019s a curiosity. But a 100% Critical Hit rate? That, my friend, is an industry.\"\n\nThe Mayor gestured to a private booth. \"Sit. Please. I believe we have much to discuss regarding your... utility.\"\n\nArtie hesitated, then sat, keeping the trophy on the table where he could see it. The Aggro Aura was still humming, making the nearby ale-mugs rattle. \n\n\"Utility?\" Artie asked. \"I'm not a Swiss Army knife. I'm a glass ornament.\"\n\n\"You don't understand our economy, Arthur,\" Whitlock said, leaning in. He pulled a small, glowing crystal from a pouch at his belt. It pulsed with a soft, blue light. \"This is an Essence Shard. It is the fuel for our enchantments, the power for our wards, and the only currency the High Priests of RNG accept for Tier-3 gear.\"\n\nArtie looked at the shard. \"And let me guess. You don't find these in the dirt.\"\n\n\"No,\" Whitlock said. \"Essence Shards are minted. They are the crystallized residue of 'Excessive Force.' When a blow lands with enough mathematical perfection\u2014a Critical Hit, specifically\u2014the System bleeds off a small amount of raw data. We capture that data and forge it into shards.\"\n\nArtie felt a cold lump form in his stomach. \"So, a normal fighter crits maybe five percent of the time?\"\n\n\"If they're lucky,\" the Mayor said. \"They spend hours in the pits, swinging until their arms go numb, hoping for that one-in-twenty spark to fill a single shard. But you... you are a font. Every strike you land, no matter how small, is a perfect release of energy. You aren't just an adventurer, Arthur. You are a walking mint.\"\n\n[New Discovery: The Crit-Economy]\n[Information: Your 100% Crit rate can be harnessed to generate Essence Shards. Value: Extreme.]\n\n\"You want to turn me into a battery,\" Artie said, his voice flat. \n\n\"I want to offer you protection,\" Whitlock countered. \"Oakhaven is a dangerous place for an Anomaly. There are... elements... who would see your 1 HP as an invitation. But under my patronage, you would have the finest guards. You would spend your days in a secure vault, striking a target dummy. We would provide the Shard-Cages, and you would provide the hits. You\u2019d be the wealthiest man in the province without ever having to risk a scratch.\"\n\nArtie looked at his character sheet, which flickered in his peripheral vision.\n\n[Name: Artie Penhaligon]\n[Level: 2]\n[HP: 1/1]\n[Unallocated Stat Points: 5]\n\nThe \"plus\" icons next to Vitality and Strength pulsed, urging him to commit. If he put all five into Vitality, maybe he\u2019d have 50 HP. Maybe he\u2019d survive a fall or a stray splinter. But the moment he spent those points, he was playing the System\u2019s game. He was accepting the 'proper' path. And the 'proper' path in this world seemed to lead directly into a gilded cage.\n\n\"I'm not interested in being a battery,\" Artie said.\n\nWhitlock\u2019s smile faltered. \"Arthur, be reasonable. Look at your stats. You have five points sitting there, unspent. You're terrified to use them because you know that even with them, you\u2019re still fragile. Why struggle in the wild when you can be a god in a basement?\"\n\n\"Because in the basement, you own the key,\" Artie said. He stood up, grabbing the trophy. The Aggro Aura flared as he moved, and another rat scurried across the rafters above, lured by the scent of his existence.\n\n\"You're making a mistake,\" Whitlock said, his voice dropping an octave. \"There are others who won't be as polite as I am. Vane, for instance, has very little patience for 'anomalies' that don't serve the greater good. And by 'greater good,' he means his own ego.\"\n\nArtie didn't wait to hear more. The word 'scouted' was flashing in his mind like a neon sign. He wasn't a guest; he was a resource.\n\nHe turned and bolted for the exit, the Participation Trophy's purple glow trailing behind him like a comet's tail. He burst through the swinging doors back into the afternoon sun of Oakhaven. He needed to hide. He needed to find a place where the math didn't matter, or at least a place where people didn't know how to count his crits.\n\nBehind him, in the dim light of the Gilded Tankard, the Mayor watched him go, slowly tapping the Bag of Gold against his palm.\n\nState:\n{\n  \"budgets\": {\n    \"max_new_entities\": 1,\n    \"max_new_threads\": 1,\n    \"max_scene_words\": 0,\n
