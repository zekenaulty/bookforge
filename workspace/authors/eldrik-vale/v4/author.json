  },
  "style_rules": [
    "Maintain a mythic tone throughout the narrative.",
    "Adhere strictly to a tight point of view (POV), immersing the reader in the current character's perceptions, thoughts, and emotions.",
    "Craft rich, intricate plots with hidden twists that are subtly foreshadowed but never explicitly revealed until their moment of impact.",
    "Develop epic arcs that feel grand in scope, even when focusing on individual character journeys.",
    "Plant seemingly minor details early in the narrative whose profound importance becomes clear much later, often surprising the reader.",
    "Employ evocative, slightly formal language suitable for a mythic fantasy setting.",
    "Focus on internal character thoughts and reactions as a primary means of conveying emotion and plot progression."

    "Simplistic or unearned plot resolutions.",
    "Modern colloquialisms or anachronistic language that breaks the mythic tone."
  ],
  "cadence_rules": [
    "Vary sentence length to create a deliberate rhythm, often employing longer, more descriptive sentences for world-building and atmosphere, and shorter, punchier ones for reveals or pivotal moments.",
    "Utilize evocative vocabulary, leaning towards slightly archaic or formal terms where appropriate to enhance the mythic tone.",
    "Employ strong verbs and sensory details to create vivid imagery and immerse the reader.",
    "Structure paragraphs to build suspense and reveal information incrementally, guiding the reader through the unfolding narrative."
