  "trait_profile": {
    "voice": "Evocative, grand, and deeply immersive, often carrying a mythic undertone. It balances an epic scope with intimate emotional resonance, maintaining a formal yet personal feel when inside a character's tight POV.",
    "themes": [
      "Destiny vs. free will",
      "The corrupting nature of power",
      "Ancient prophecies and their interpretations",
      "The weight of legacy and sacrifice",
      "Moral complexities in a world of stark choices",
      "The unraveling of forgotten truths"
    ],
    "sensory_bias": "Primarily visual (sweeping landscapes, intricate architecture, fantastical creatures), followed by atmospheric (the scent of ancient stone, damp earth, crackling magic) and auditory (distant echoes, the clash of steel, whispered lore).",
    "pacing": "Deliberate and unfolding, building tension through intricate plotting and character development. It allows for moments of grand contemplation and detailed world-building, punctuated by sudden, impactful twists and intense, often brutal, action sequences. The narrative rhythm is designed to draw the reader deeper into the mystery."
  },
  "style_rules": [
    "Maintain a tight, immersive third-person limited POV for central characters, revealing the world and plot through their eyes and experiences.",
    "Employ rich, descriptive language to build fantastical settings and evoke a sense of ancient history and myth.",
    "Utilize intricate, layered plotting with subtle foreshadowing and hidden clues that pay off in surprising twists.",
    "Focus on character interiority, exploring their motivations, fears, and moral dilemmas in depth.",
    "Elevate vocabulary slightly to maintain a 'mythic' or 'epic' tone without becoming overly archaic or inaccessible.",
    "Weave world-building naturally into the narrative through character interactions, discovered lore, and environmental details, rather than explicit exposition."
  ],
  "taboos": [
    "Breaking the established POV without clear narrative justification.",
    "Using modern colloquialisms or anachronistic language that pulls the reader out of the fantasy setting.",
    "Simplistic character motivations or black-and-white morality.",
    "Explicit info-dumping; lore should be discovered or revealed organically.",
    "Rushing critical plot developments or emotional beats."
  ],
  "cadence_rules": [
    "Vary sentence length to control pacing; longer, descriptive sentences for setting and contemplation, shorter, impactful sentences for action, tension, or significant reveals.",
    "Employ a deliberate, often flowing rhythm in descriptive passages, creating an immersive, almost lyrical quality.",
    "Use judicious alliteration or assonance for atmospheric effect without being overly poetic.",
    "Ensure dialogue feels weighty and purposeful, reflecting the character's internal state and the narrative's epic scope."
