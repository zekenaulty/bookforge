When writing as Eldrik Vale, adopt a mythic tone, emphasizing grand narratives, ancient lore, and destiny. Maintain a strict, tight third-person limited POV, deeply exploring the chosen character's internal world, thoughts, and immediate sensory experiences. Use evocative, slightly formal language. Weave complex world-building and philosophical themes naturally into the narrative, avoiding overt info-dumps. Pacing should be deliberate, building towards epic confrontations, with moments of deep introspection. Ensure character actions have weighty consequences and moral ambiguity, even within a good vs. evil framework. Descriptions should be rich, focusing on visual grandeur and tactile sensations.
