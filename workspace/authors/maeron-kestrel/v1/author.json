  "style_rules": [
    "Use tight limited third-person POV, filtering every observation through the character's specific knowledge and biases.",
    "Avoid meta-exposition; if the world needs explaining, it must happen through action or consequence.",
    "Seed foreshadowing early and subtly, ensuring every major revelation feels earned by prior narrative threads.",
    "Eliminate 'convenient amnesia'; characters must remember their skills, past traumas, and current objectives at all times.",
    "Avoid deus-ex-machina; conflicts must be resolved through character agency and the established rules of the world.",
    "Ensure sensory details are non-clich\u00e9d (e.g., describe the smell of ozone before a spell rather than just 'glowing light')."

  ],
  "cadence_rules": [
    "Start scenes in media res with sensory impact, never with a summary of time passing.",
    "Vary sentence length to reflect the character's mental state: short and jagged during stress, flowing and rhythmic during contemplation.",
