The air itself seemed to hum with an ancient, resonant cold, a quality not of temperature but of time, thick with the dust of epochs. Eldrin exhaled, the sound a ragged friction against the silence of the Old Archive. His lungs felt brittle, as if the very act of breathing was a transgression against the stillness he had inhabited for centuries. The golden pulse that had shattered his slumber still vibrated in his marrow, a fading chord of power that left a hollow ache in its wake.

He did not move. He did not need to. The shadows in the far corner of the vaulted chamber were not merely dark; they were occupied. 

A floorboard groaned—a sharp, structural protest that echoed off the scarred stone walls. Eldrin turned his head with a slow, deliberate grace that felt entirely foreign to the stiff muscles of his new vessel. Twenty paces away, framed by a collapsed archway, stood a woman. She was crouched low, a predator’s posture, with a recurve bow drawn to full tension. The arrowhead, fashioned from a dark, matte metal he didn't recognize, pointed directly at the hollow of his throat.

"Don't," she said. Her voice was a low rasp, honed by grit and pragmatism. It lacked the melodic cadence of the High Tongue Eldrin remembered, replaced by a clipped, functional urgency. 

Eldrin’s gaze drifted from the arrow to the woman herself. She wore leathers stained by salt and travel, reinforced with plates of boiled hide. Her hair was a shock of dark tangles pulled back from a face that was all sharp angles and guarded suspicion. She looked like a creature born of a harsher, leaner world than the one he had left behind.

"You are a hunter," Eldrin said. His own voice surprised him—it was deep, resonant, and carried the weight of a mountain. It felt like a stone being dragged across silk.

"I’m the person who’s going to kill you if you reach for that stone again," she countered. Her eyes, a piercing, flinty grey, never wavered. "Step back. Slow. Keep your hands where the light can find them."

Eldrin looked down at his hands. They were pale, etched with the faint, glowing tracery of the pulse that had awakened him. The artifact—the stone that had been his anchor and his prison—lay at his feet, its surface now dull and cooling. To her, it was a prize or a threat. To him, it was a discarded shell.

"The light has already found me, Lyra," he murmured, the name surfacing from some deep, intuitive well of the Archive’s lingering echoes, or perhaps from the way she held herself, like the constellations he once mapped.

The woman stiffened, the bowstring humming with the tension of her grip. "How do you know my name?"

"I know the shape of the wind in this place," Eldrin replied, his disorientation manifesting as a detached, ethereal calm. He took a single step forward. The movement was fluid, lacking the jerky hesitation of the living. To Lyra, it must have looked like a ghost gliding through the gloom.

"I said stay back!" She shifted her weight, the arrow tracking his movement with lethal precision. "I don't care what kind of ruin-wraith you think you are. People don't just wake up in the Archive. Not after the Collapse. Not without a mark."

"The Collapse," Eldrin repeated. The words felt heavy, a confirmation of the void in his memory. He looked around at the shattered shelves, the scrolls turned to grey mulch by the damp, the statues decapitated by time. "A fitting name for the end of all things. Tell me, hunter, how many years have passed since the stars were last aligned over the Spire of Aethelgard?"

Lyra’s brow furrowed, a flicker of genuine confusion breaking through her defensive mask. "Aethelgard? That’s a nursery rhyme. A ghost story for the children in the Reach." She lowered the bow an inch, though the tension remained. "There hasn't been a Spire in the world for a thousand years, if it ever existed at all."

A thousand years. The number hit Eldrin with the force of a physical blow. He reached out to steady himself against a nearby pillar, his fingers brushing the cold, scarred stone. The "ancient cold" he had felt wasn't just the atmosphere; it was the realization that he was an anachronism, a stray thought preserved in a world that had forgotten the language of his soul.

"Then I have slept longer than intended," Eldrin said, his voice dropping to a whisper. He looked back at her, seeing not just a threat, but a bridge to a reality he did not understand. "And you are the first thing I have seen in a millennium that possesses a heartbeat."

Lyra didn't relax her stance, but the lethal edge in her eyes softened into a wary curiosity. She saw a man who looked like a lord of old, dressed in robes that should have been dust but instead shimmered with a faint, residual light. He looked powerful, yet profoundly lost.

"You're not a wraith," she noted, her voice less of a snarl now. "Wraiths don't breathe. And they don't look like they’re about to collapse from the weight of their own shadow."

"I am... Eldrin," he said, the name feeling like a suit of armor he was still learning to wear. "And I suspect, Lyra the Hunter, that we are both standing in the wreckage of a world that neither of us fully understands."

Lyra slowly eased the tension on the bowstring, though she didn't un-notch the arrow. She took a half-step out of the shadows, the faint light from the ceiling-breach catching the steel of her gear. 

"The ruins are crawling with things worse than me," she said, her pragmatism returning. "The pulse you set off... it was loud. Every scavenger and 'beast within five leagues heard it. If you can walk, we need to move. If you can't, I’m leaving you to the dark."

Eldrin straightened, the ancient cold in his bones replaced by a flicker of purpose. "I can walk. Lead the way, hunter. Show me what has become of the world while I dreamt of stars."
