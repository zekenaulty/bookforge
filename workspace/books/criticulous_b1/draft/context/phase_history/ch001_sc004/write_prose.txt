The Lesser Green Slime didn’t just lunge; it performed a gravitational insult. 

It was a wobbling mass of translucent, neon-citrus phlegm that had spent the last thirty seconds cornering me against a jagged outcrop of rock. Now, it was mid-air, a "Tutorial Slam" in progress, and my entire life—all twenty-eight years of spreadsheets, lukewarm coffee, and that final, fatal argument with a vending machine—was about to be ended by a sentient puddle.

"Not like this," I wheezed, my lungs still feeling like they’d been scrubbed with steel wool from the electrocution. "I am not dying to a dessert topping."

I threw myself to the right. It wasn't a graceful roll. It was a panicked, flailing collapse that sent me face-first into the vibrant, glowing grass. The slime hit the rock behind me with a wet *thwack*, the sound of a giant steak being dropped onto a tile floor. 

I scrambled to my feet, my heart hammering against my ribs. The Corporate ID Badge clipped to my lanyard swung wildly, the plastic edge catching me in the chin. I ignored it. I didn't have a sword. I didn't even have a sharpened pencil. I had two fists that had never hit anything harder than a 'Caps Lock' key.

"Okay, Artie. Math. Focus on the math," I muttered. My hazel eyes darted around the Slime Fields, looking for an exit, but the creature was already re-inflating itself for another go. "I have a hundred percent crit rate. That has to mean something, right? If I hit it, it breaks."

The slime jiggled. It looked like it was laughing.

I stepped forward, trying to channel every action movie I’d ever seen. I pulled my right fist back, my keyboard-calloused palm sweating, and launched a punch that I intended to be a jaw-shattering hook.

[Accuracy Check: 12% (Poor Form)]

I swung so hard I actually spun. My fist whistled through the air, missing the slime’s core by a good six inches. The momentum carried me past the creature, and I nearly tripped over my own feet.

[Miss #1: Over-extension]

"Calibration," I gasped, spinning back around. "Just a calibration swing."

The slime bobbed. It seemed to be waiting for me. I lunged again, this time with a straight jab. I kept my eyes open for approximately half a second before the sheer terror of the creature’s undulating surface made me flinch. My arm went limp, and I basically just waved at the monster.

[Miss #2: Flinch Reflex]

"Stop looking at me like that!" I yelled at the slime. It didn't have eyes, but I could feel the judgment radiating from its gelatinous bulk. 

I tried a double-handed shove, hoping to at least knock it back. I stepped into the neon-green slime trail it had left behind. My left foot went north, my right foot went nowhere, and I performed a frantic, mid-air dance that ended with me slapping the air where the slime had been a second ago.

[Miss #3: Environmental Slip]

The slime shifted, its core—a dark, pea-sized nucleus—pulsing with a faint light. It was preparing another slam. I was running out of rock to hide behind and running out of dignity to lose.

"Third time's the charm? No, that was three. Fourth! Fourth is... statistically significant!"

I charged. This wasn't a punch. This was a desperate, eyes-closed flail. I swung my left arm in a wide arc, my fist aimed at the center of the mass. The slime simply compressed itself, the top of its head dipping just low enough that my knuckles scraped over the top of its sticky skin without actually registering a hit.

[Miss #4: Target Compression]

I was panting now. My slender frame wasn't built for this. My Corporate ID Badge was tangled in my shirt, and I could feel the weight of my Smartphone and Leather Wallet in my pockets, dragging at my trousers. Every movement felt sluggish, like I was trying to fight underwater.

The slime launched. It was a low-altitude glide, aimed straight for my chest.

"Get! Away!" I screamed, throwing a frantic kick. 

I missed. Not just the slime, but the ground. I overcompensated for the creature's movement, my leg sailing through empty space, and I landed hard on my backside.

[Miss #5: Total Balance Failure]

The slime landed inches from my crotch, its surface vibrating with the intensity of a subwoofer. It was over. I was on the ground, 1 HP, and the tutorial monster was ready to deliver the final 'Tutorial Slam'.

"Screw you," I hissed at the floating text. 

The slime reared back, expanding to twice its size. It was a wall of green death. I didn't have time to stand. I didn't have time to aim. I just reached out with my right hand—the one with the keyboard callus—and gave the slime a weak, pathetic shove, as if I were trying to move a slightly annoying person out of my way at the deli counter.

It was the most half-hearted attack in the history of the multiverse.

The moment my palm touched the slime’s surface, the world didn't just stop; it stuttered. 

The neon-green grass turned into a smear of static. The air smelled suddenly of burnt silicon and ozone. A sound like a thousand glass windows shattering at once erupted from the point of contact.

A pillar of white, blinding light erupted from my hand. It didn't just hit the slime; it erased it. The Lesser Green Slime didn't pop or splatter; it simply ceased to be. The light continued, a horizontal spear of pure mathematical fury that tore through the Slime Fields. 

Twenty feet behind where the slime had been, a massive, ancient-looking oak tree stood. Or it had stood. The beam of the crit hit the trunk, and the tree didn't fall. It disintegrated. The wood turned to ash, then the ash turned to light, and then there was just a perfectly circular hole where a forest giant had been a second ago.

The shockwave knocked me backward, my head ringing. I scrambled away from the smoking line of scorched earth that now cut through the tutorial zone.

I stared at the crater. A single, charred leaf drifted down from the sky, landing on my nose.

"I... I think I broke the tutorial," I whispered, my voice cracking.

I looked down at my hand. It was perfectly fine. No burns, no scratches. Just the same faint keyboard callus I’d had since college. But where the slime had been, there was now a smoking, blackened pit in the earth, and the smell of ozone was thick enough to taste.

I sat there for a long time, the Corporate ID Badge finally coming to a rest against my chest. I was Level 2. I was alive. And I was officially the most dangerous thing in this world—mostly because I had no idea what I was doing.
