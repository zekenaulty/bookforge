The cobblestones of Oakhaven weren't designed for sprinting, especially when you were carrying a glowing golden trophy that pulsed with the rhythmic insistence of a neon "Eat at Joe's" sign. I ducked around a corner, my breath hitching in a chest that felt like it was made of wet cardboard. 

[Stamina: 42/100]

"Come on," I hissed, shifting the weight of the Participation Trophy (Tutorial Edition) in my left hand. The damn thing felt heavier with every step, and the Aggro Aura was practically humming, a low-frequency vibration that made my teeth ache. Somewhere nearby, a stray cat hissed, its fur standing on end as the trophy’s "come-and-get-me" magic tickled its primitive brain.

I needed to disappear. Mayor Whitlock’s offer of becoming a "Crit-Battery" sounded less like a job and more like a life sentence in a gilded hamster wheel. I wasn't about to spend the rest of my isekai experience in a basement, punching rocks to mint currency for a man who smelled faintly of mothballs and corruption. 

I turned into a narrow passage between a weaver’s shop and a warehouse, hoping the shadows would swallow the glow of my "Statistical Anomaly" status. I didn't get five feet before the air ahead of me shimmered, turning a sharp, crystalline blue.

"Moving a bit fast for a man with only one hit point, aren't you?"

The voice was like expensive silk being dragged over a whetstone. I skidded to a halt, my boots sparking against the stone. 

Standing at the end of the alley was a man who looked like he’d been airbrushed by a team of professional vanity-propagandists. He wore plate armor so polished I could see my own terrified, sweat-streaked reflection in his breastplate. A blue velvet cape draped over one shoulder, pinned by a brooch that probably cost more than my entire previous life's net worth. 

He didn't just have a name tag; he had a title hovering in shimmering gold letters.

[Vane - Lvl 24 - Paladin of the Radiant Roll]

"Vane," I muttered, my right hand tightening around the hilt of my Rusty Shortsword (Prop). The system-mandated label was still there, mocking me.

"So, the rumors are true," Vane said, stepping forward. His movements were fluid, effortless. He had the kind of Agility stats that made physics look like a suggestion. "A Level 2 glitch walking around with a 100% Critical Hit rate. Do you have any idea how much that offends the natural order of the Leaderboards? It’s untidy. It’s... offensive."

"I’m more of a 'happy accident' than a glitch," I said, trying to edge toward the wall. "Think of me as a localized patch that hasn't been applied yet. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a very important appointment with not-being-here."

Vane chuckled, a sound that made me want to punch him in his perfect, symmetrical teeth. He reached down and rested a hand on the hilt of his weapon—an Ornate Rapier with a guard shaped like a soaring phoenix.

"Oakhaven is a town of commerce, Penhaligon. But I am a man of metrics. I don't believe in anomalies. I believe in testing the variables until they break. And you, my friend, look very, very breakable."

With a flick of his wrist, the rapier was out. It didn't just draw; it sang. A high, clear note that resonated in the narrow space.

[System Notification: Vane (Lvl 24) has challenged you to a Friendly Duel!]
[Type: First Blood / To Yield]
[Stakes: 100 Gold Pieces (Auto-debited on loss)]
[Accept? Y/N]

The holographic window popped up right in my line of sight, glowing with a persistent, annoying blue light. A translucent fence began to shimmer into existence around us, cordoning off the alleyway.

"A 'friendly' duel?" I asked, my voice cracking. "I have one hit point, Vane. Your 'friendly' sneeze would send me back to the login screen. And I don't even have a hundred gold! I’m currently worth about three copper and a bag of lint."

"The System will simply put you into debt," Vane said, his eyes narrowing. "As for the health... well, that’s the point, isn't it? If you're truly a 100% Crit-machine, you should be able to end this before I even finish a lunge. Let’s see if that 'Prop' sword of yours can actually draw blood, or if you're just a walking UI error."

He stepped into a duelist’s stance, the rapier leveled at my throat. The tip of the blade was so steady it looked like it was frozen in time.

"Accept the challenge, Anomaly. Or I’ll just wait for the timer to expire and the System to auto-accept on the grounds of 'Cowardice Clause 4-B'."

I looked at the 'Y/N' prompt. It was pulsing. 

"You know," I said, my mind racing. "There’s a very specific rule about duels in the Oakhaven Municipal Code. And the System is very big on municipal codes."

Vane smirked. "Oh? Enlighten me."

I held up my right hand, the one clutching the rusted, notched blade. "This isn't a weapon. Check the tag, Vane. Use your Basic Analysis."

Vane frowned, his eyes flickering as he scanned the sword. I saw the moment he realized it. 

[Item: Rusty Shortsword (Prop)]
[Damage: 0-1]
[Note: For theatrical use only. Not suitable for combat.]

"It’s a prop," I said, my confidence growing as I saw the logic-loop forming in his eyes. "The System Duel protocol requires both participants to be equipped with a 'Valid Combat Instrument.' I am currently equipped with a 'Theatrical Accessory.' Therefore, the duel is legally invalid. You can't start a duel if one party is technically unarmed."

Vane’s brow furrowed. "That’s a technicality. You used it to kill a coyote at the gate. I saw the logs."

"I used it to crit a coyote," I corrected him. "The physics engine did the work, not the weapon. But for a formal Duel? The System needs a weapon it can calculate 'First Blood' from. You can't draw blood with a prop sword unless the other guy is a really bad actor. The sub-routine won't even initialize."

Vane growled, his rapier dipping slightly. The blue fence around us flickered, turning a muddy purple as the System struggled to reconcile the challenge with my inventory.

[System Warning: Invalid Duel Parameters Detected. Checking Equipment Validity...]

"You're a coward," Vane spat. "Hiding behind a label."

"I’m a man who enjoys having a pulse," I countered. I looked down at the Participation Trophy in my other hand. It was still glowing, and the air in the alley was starting to feel heavy. The Aggro Aura was at peak intensity, and I could hear scratching coming from the sewer grates.

"And speaking of labels... do you know what this is?" I held the trophy out toward him. 

"It’s a trophy. A participation prize for losers," Vane said, his lip curling in disgust.

"Actually, it’s a beacon," I said. "And I think the Oakhaven local fauna just got the invite."

In the distance, I heard the baying of something that definitely wasn't a dog. The Aggro Aura was pulling in every hostile entity within three blocks. A swarm of Level 4 Alley Rats began pouring out of the sewers, their eyes red and fixed entirely on the trophy in my hand. They were the size of small badgers, with teeth that looked like they could chew through plate mail.

"What are you doing?" Vane demanded, stepping back as the first rat leaped at his shin.

"I’m canceling the duel due to 'External Interference'," I yelled. 

I didn't wait for the System to finish its Equipment Check. I threw the Participation Trophy... not at Vane, but over him, deeper into the alley. 

Vane instinctively turned to follow the arc of the glowing gold object. It was a reflex. Even high-level Paladins can't resist a shiny loot-drop, or at least the instinct to track a projectile.

As the trophy clattered to the ground behind him, the swarm of rats ignored me entirely, surging past my legs like a furry, squeaking tide. They went straight for Vane and the trophy.

[System Notification: Duel Canceled. Combatants are currently in an 'Aggro-Zone'.]

"You little—!" Vane started, but he was forced to bring his rapier up to parry a leaping rat that was aiming for his throat. "Get off me, you vermin!"

"Enjoy the fans, Vane! They really seem to like your metrics!" I shouted. 

I didn't stick around to see how a Level 24 Paladin handled fifty rats. I turned and bolted back the way I came, my boots pounding against the stone. I ducked into a side street, then another, twisting through the narrowest gaps I could find, my heart hammering against my ribs like a trapped bird.

I didn't stop until I was deep in the backstreets, the air smelling of old cabbage and damp laundry. I leaned against a wall, my lungs screaming for mercy.

[Stamina: 5/100]

I reached into my pocket and felt the cold metal of the Anomaly ID Tag. I pulled it out, looking at the flickering text. 

"Statistical Anomaly," I whispered. "Yeah. And a giant pain in the neck."

I had escaped the Mayor, and I had insulted the most powerful-looking guy in town. My social standing was currently somewhere below 'Plague Carrier,' and I was officially out of trophies. But I was alive. 

[New Thread Started: The Vane Vendetta]
[Description: You’ve insulted a Paladin's pride and used a technicality to avoid his blade. He won't forget the 'Prop' incident. Or the rats.]

"Great," I muttered, sliding the tag back into my pocket. "More content. Just what I needed."

I looked around at the darkening alley. I was broke, I had 1 HP, and the most dangerous man in Oakhaven probably wanted to turn me into a very expensive puddle. 

"Welcome to the game, Artie," I told myself. "Try not to die before the first save point."
