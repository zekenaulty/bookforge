The golden haze from the vaporized lock hadn't even settled before the front window of Barnaby's Bargains & Blunders imploded. A hail of glass shards whistled through the air, narrowly missing Artie's head as he lunged toward the pedestal. Outside, the roar of the mob had shifted from a general riot to a focused, predatory chant. They weren't just looting anymore; they were hunting the Anomaly.

[Aggro Meter: 99% (CRITICAL DENSITY)]

Artie didn't look back. The shop was a graveyard of splintered wood and shattered dreams, the air thick with the smell of ozone and old parchment. He reached into the shimmering light of the pedestal and snatched the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion with his right hand. The fabric felt like wet silk and looked like someone had bottled the essence of a thousand high-visibility safety vests. It wasn't just yellow; it was aggressively, offensively neon. It was the kind of yellow that hurt to look at directly, a color that screamed for attention while its very name promised the opposite.

"Fifty evasion?" Artie hissed, throwing the garment over his shoulders. The cloak felt surprisingly heavy, as if the weight of his own shame had been woven into the hem. He didn't have time to worry about his dignity; he had exactly one hit point and a shop full of people who suddenly wanted him dead. "I’ll take it. I’ll take anything that keeps me from being a smear on the floor."

The moment the cloak settled on his frame, a translucent blue box flickered in his peripheral vision, updating his vitals with a crisp, digital chime.

[HP: 1/1]
[Evasion: 50]

A heavy-set townsperson, eyes glowing with the unnatural red light of the 'Marked for Death' status, vaulted over the shattered counter. He was a butcher by trade, if the blood-stained apron and the massive meat cleaver were any indication. He swung the blade in a wide, desperate arc that should have cleaved Artie in two. 

Artie didn't even have time to think about dodging. He didn't move his feet; his body simply blurred. He felt a strange, greasy sensation as the air itself seemed to push him three inches to the left, the cleaver passing through the space where his shoulder had been a millisecond prior. The blade buried itself in the wood of the pedestal with a dull, final *thunk*.

[Evasion Proc! (50% Chance)]

"Sorry! Just passing through! No refunds!" Artie shouted, his voice cracking under the strain of pure, unadulterated terror. He pivoted, the neon yellow fabric of the Cloak of the Cowardly Lion snapping behind him like a flare in a dark cave. 

The Participation Trophy remained firmly fused to his left hand, its golden surface pulsing in time with the Aggro Meter. He felt like a walking lighthouse. Every monster, guard, and disgruntled shopper within a mile was currently recalculating their route to intersect with his face. The trophy was a beacon, and the cloak was a neon sign pointing at the beacon. He was the most visible man in Oakhaven, and possibly the most fragile.

The back wall of the shop groaned as a stray fireball from the street outside clipped the foundation. Dust rained down in thick, choking sheets. Artie scrambled over a pile of ruined crates, his eyes locked on the small, unassuming service door at the rear of the building. 

Another attacker—a low-level thief who had probably just been looking for a quick score—lunged from the shadows of the rafters. The thief’s dagger was aimed straight for Artie’s throat. Again, the gear reacted. Artie did a frantic, uncoordinated stumble-step, his knees buckling in a way that should have sent him face-first into the dirt. Instead, the dagger whistled harmlessly over his head.

[Evasion Proc! (50% Chance)]

"I hate this game! I hate the math! I hate everything about this!" Artie yelled, kicking the back door open with a desperate boot.

He burst out into the narrow, filth-strewn alleyway behind the shop. The 'Coward’s Sprint' kicked in immediately. It wasn't a graceful increase in speed; it felt like his legs had been replaced by high-tension springs. His feet barely touched the cobbles as he bolted away from the collapsing structure. The wind whipped the neon yellow cloak behind him, making him look like a radioactive comet streaking through the gray shadows of Oakhaven’s backstreets.

Behind him, the shop gave one final, agonizing creak before the roof caved in. A cloud of splinters and stone dust billowed out into the alley, momentarily burying the entrance and the mob that had been trying to squeeze through it. 

Artie didn't stop to check the loot or catch his breath. He kept running, his heart hammering against his single point of health, the neon yellow streak of his shame the only bright thing in a world that was very quickly trying to delete him.
