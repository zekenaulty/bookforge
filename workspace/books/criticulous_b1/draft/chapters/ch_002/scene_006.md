The Skeleton Archer stood there, rattling its empty quiver with the rhythmic futility of a broken office printer. Artie didn't move yet. He stayed locked in the pocket of the 120-BPM attack script he’d deciphered, his feet still twitching in time with the "upbeat" of its non-existent arrows.

"It’s out of ammo, Artie," Fizz said, her translucent blue form flickering with bored impatience. "You can stop the moonwalk. It’s embarrassing for both of us, and I’m technically a ghost."

Artie exhaled, his lungs burning. His stamina bar was hovering at a precarious sixty-four percent. Using Pattern Recognition (Rank G) to identify the archer's 120-BPM attack script had saved his life, but it felt like he’d just finished a high-stakes aerobics class in a neon-yellow cat suit.

[Aggro Meter: 100% (Critical Density)]

The Cloak of the Cowardly Lion pulsed with a garish, rhythmic light, illuminating the damp stone of the crypts. In his left hand, the Participation Trophy felt heavier than usual, its gold-plated surface catching the neon glare. 

"He had to hit it," Artie muttered, stepping forward. "If I don't kill it, I don't get the XP. And if I don't get the XP, I’m just a guy in a glowing rug waiting to get stepped on by a boss."

"Then hit it," Fizz prompted. "It’s a Level 4 skeleton. It has exactly twelve hit points left. Even your noodle arms should be able to manage that."

Artie approached the archer. It didn't retreat. It just stood its ground, trying to draw a bowstring that held nothing but air. He pulled back his right fist—the one with the small vending machine scar on the knuckle—and swung.

[Critical Hit! 100% Rate Applied]
[Damage: 48 (Overkill x4)]

The moment his fist connected with the skeleton’s ribcage, the world didn't just make a sound; it stuttered. The frame rate of reality dropped to a crawl. The skeleton didn't shatter into bone dust. Instead, it began to vibrate, its white bones turning into a chaotic blur of flickering textures.

[Error: Damage Calculation Overflow]
[System Status: Overload - Recalculating Drop Table...]

"Uh, Fizz?" Artie asked, backing away as the skeleton began to glow with a blinding, jagged white light. "Is it supposed to do that? Is it going into phase two?"

"No," Fizz whispered, her eyes wide. "It’s... it’s crashing."

With a sound like a thousand glass windows shattering simultaneously, the skeleton exploded. But it wasn't a normal death animation. It was a loot geyser. Bone shards, copper coins, and rusted arrowheads erupted from the center of the blast, raining down on the stone floor in a deluge of metallic clinking and clattering.

[Loot Drop: Bone Shards (x20)]
[Loot Drop: Ancient Copper Coin (x50)]
[Loot Drop: Rusty Arrowheads (x5)]
[Loot Drop: Frayed Bowstring (x1)]
[Loot Drop: 'Almost-Legendary' Calcium Supplement (x1)]

The notifications scrolled so fast Artie could barely read them. The floor was covered. A standard Level 4 mob was supposed to drop a few coins and maybe a cracked rib if you were lucky. This was a haul fit for a mid-tier raid boss.

Artie looked at the pile of items, then at his fist. He still clutched the Participation Trophy in his left hand, its cursed glow reflecting off the mountain of copper.

"Fizz," Artie said, his voice trembling with a realization that bypassed his fear. "A normal party of four would have to clear this entire wing to get this much loot."

"Artie," Fizz said, drifting over the pile. "You didn't just kill it. You critted the loot table itself. Your 100% Crit Rate is confusing the System into thinking you’ve performed a Perfect Overkill on every single possible drop roll."

Artie reached down and scooped up a handful of Ancient Copper Coins, stuffing them into the oversized pockets of his Cloak of the Cowardly Lion. The weight was real. The math was broken. 

"I don't need to be strong," he whispered, a slow, frantic grin spreading across his face. "I just need to keep breaking the math. I’m not a player. I’m a professional auditor."

Artie looked deeper into the crypts. For the first time since he’d arrived in this RNG-hellscape, he wasn't looking for the exit. He was looking for the next thing he could punch until it turned into money.
