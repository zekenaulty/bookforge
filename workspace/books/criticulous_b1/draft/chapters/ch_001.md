# Chapter 1: Welcome to the RNG-Hellscape

## The Exit Interview

The humid, popcorn-scented air of the breakroom felt like a personal insult. Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stood before the Snack-o-Matic 3000, his reflection in the plexiglass revealing a man whose mousy brown hair had finally given up on the concept of structure. His hazel eyes, usually sharp enough to spot a decimal error in a ten-thousand-row spreadsheet, were currently glazed with the hollow hunger of a man who had skipped lunch to fix a server migration.

In his right hand, he held a Crumpled Dollar Bill. It was a pathetic scrap of legal tender, softened by time and laundry cycles into something resembling a used tissue. Artie smoothed the Crumpled Dollar Bill against the edge of the machine's cold metal chassis, trying to coax some dignity back into the George Washington's wrinkled face. 

"Come on, George," Artie whispered, his voice cracking. "Just one bag of Cool Ranch. That’s all I need to survive the 4:00 PM status meeting. Don't do this to me."

He fed the Crumpled Dollar Bill into the slot. The machine groaned, a mechanical sound of gears grinding against years of accumulated dust and spilled soda. The intake rollers grabbed the Crumpled Dollar Bill, pulled it halfway in, and then—with a shudder that felt suspiciously like a shrug—spat the Crumpled Dollar Bill back out.

Artie caught the Crumpled Dollar Bill before it hit the sticky linoleum floor. He looked at his Corporate ID Badge, which dangled from a frayed blue lanyard around his neck. The photo on the badge showed a younger, more optimistic version of himself, a Junior Data Analyst who still believed that hard work resulted in something other than lower-back pain and a 1.0 Luck stat.

"You're seeing this, right?" he asked the empty room. The only response was the rhythmic hum of a refrigerator that had been vibrating since the late nineties.

He tried again. This time, he used his thumb and forefinger to iron out the corners of the bill with the precision of a diamond cutter. He fed the Crumpled Dollar Bill in slowly. The machine swallowed it. The rollers whirred. A digital display, flickering with a dying orange glow, changed from zero to one dollar.

Artie breathed a sigh of relief. He hovered his finger over the keypad. B-4. The position of the last remaining bag of chips. The holy grail of the afternoon slump. He pressed the buttons with a flourish.

Inside the machine, the metal coil began to rotate. The bag of chips shifted forward. It tilted. It reached the precipice. And then, the coil stopped. The bag hung there, suspended by a single plastic corner, dangling over the drop zone like a climber clinging to a cliff face in a low-budget action movie.

The orange display blinked a jam error.

"No," Artie said, his voice dropping to a dangerous register. "No, no, no. You did not just do that."

He tapped the plexiglass. Nothing. He nudged the machine with his shoulder. The bag of chips didn't even quiver. 

Artie looked down at his slender frame. He wasn't a man of great physical power. His Strength was the kind of number that made gym teachers weep. But he had one thing: a lifetime of being screwed over by automated systems. He had a specific set of skills.

He gripped the edges of the Snack-o-Matic. He planted his feet on the linoleum, feeling the faint keyboard callus on his right palm burn against the metal. He began to shake.

This wasn't just a random tremor. This was a calculated, rhythmic assault. He pulled the machine forward and shoved it back, timing the oscillations to match the internal frequency of the snack coils. 

"Give. Me. My. Chips!" 

The machine rattled. Inside, the bag of chips began to dance. Artie felt a surge of adrenaline. He was winning. For once in his miserable, data-driven life, he was going to beat the system. He ignored the Smartphone vibrating in his left pocket—probably another urgent email about a broken pivot table. It didn't matter. The only metric that mattered was the distance between those chips and the bottom of the bin.

Suddenly, the machine emitted a sound it had never made before—a high-pitched, electronic whine that sounded like a choir of angels being fed through a blender. A spark jumped from the keypad to Artie’s Corporate ID Badge.

Artie didn't have time to wonder why a vending machine was suddenly outputting enough voltage to power a small suburb. He didn't have time to regret his career choices or the fact that his Leather Wallet, tucked safely in his right pocket, was currently the only thing between his thigh and a very hot piece of metal.

A blue arc of electricity erupted from the coin slot. It bypassed the plastic buttons and slammed directly into Artie’s chest, using the metal clip of his lanyard as a lightning rod.

The world didn't go black. It went neon. 

Artie felt his heart skip a beat, then decide it was done with the whole 'beating' thing entirely. A mental notification, sounding suspiciously like a system alert, screamed that a fatal error had been detected in his user profile. Reality itself seemed to flicker, the stability of his surroundings dropping to a precarious ninety-nine percent as the world pixelated at the edges. His muscles locked, his fingers fused to the metal frame of the machine.

The hum of the breakroom was replaced by a digital roar. Artie’s last thought wasn't of his family, or his unrequited love for the receptionist, or even the chips. 

It was: *I bet the machine keeps my dollar.*

Then, the surge peaked. Arthur Penhaligon, Junior Data Analyst and victim of a 1.0 Luck stat, collapsed to the floor. The bag of chips finally fell, landing softly on his chest. 

He was very, very dead.

The void didn't have a floor, which was Artie’s first grievance. It was just an infinite expanse of white static that smelled faintly of ozone and unwashed server racks. He drifted in the nothingness, his Corporate ID Badge dangling from its lanyard and tapping rhythmically against the severe electrical burns on his chest. Every tap was a reminder that he’d been killed by a snack machine.

"Listen, User 404-Penhaligon, we really need to focus," a voice buzzed. It sounded like a hummingbird with a megaphone.

Artie looked up. Fizz was a tiny, glowing blue sprite with spiky neon blue hair that seemed to vibrate with every syllable. She was currently hovering three inches from his nose, her white eyes narrowed in what Artie assumed was the digital equivalent of a headache.

"I’m focusing," Artie said, his voice echoing in the empty space. "I’m looking at the shiny buttons. I like buttons. Usually, they give me chips. This time, they just give me... what is 'Vigor' again?"

[System Notification: Character Creation Phase 2/3]
[Available Points: 10]
[Bonus Anomaly Pool: 50] (Warning: Unstable Source Detected)

"Vigor is survival, Arthur," Fizz said, her wings trailing pixelated dust. "It increases your HP. You know, the stuff that keeps you from being a ghost? Which, technically, you already are, but we're trying to fix that. Most players put at least five points into Vigor. It’s the ‘don't die in one hit’ tax."

Artie ignored her, his hazel eyes fixed on the Bonus Anomaly Pool. Fifty points. That was a lot of points. He felt the faint keyboard callus on his right palm itch—a phantom sensation from a life spent clicking through spreadsheets. He was a man of optimization. He was a man who knew that in a world of variables, 100% was the only number that mattered.

"And what’s this one?" Artie pointed at a stat near the bottom of the list. "Critical Hit Rate."

Fizz’s glow dimmed to a worried shade of indigo. "That? That’s for rogues and gamblers. It’s capped at 25% for Level 1 characters. The System doesn't like certainties, Arthur. It likes math. It likes the struggle."

"I’ve had enough struggle," Artie muttered. He reached out and tapped the 'plus' icon next to Critical Hit Rate. 

[Warning: Stat Allocation exceeds Level 1 soft-cap. Proceed?]

He tapped it again. And again. He dumped all ten of his standard points into the stat. Then, with a grin that felt far too wide for a dead man, he dragged the entire fifty-point Bonus Anomaly Pool into the same slot.

"Wait! No!" Fizz shrieked, diving toward the floating screen. "You can't just—that pool is from a reality-glitch death! It’s not balanced! You’re going to—"

[System Error: Statistical Anomaly Detected]
[Recalculating...]
[Critical Hit Rate: 100%]
[Condition Triggered: Glass Soul]
[Penalty: HP locked at minimum value.]

Artie felt a sudden, sharp chill. It wasn't the cold of the void; it was the sensation of his very essence being stretched thin, like a single sheet of gold foil. He looked down at his hands. They were pale, almost translucent.

[System Notification: Build Finalized]
[HP: 1/1]
[Crit Rate: 100%]

"One?" Artie blinked. "I have one hit point?"

"You have one hit point," Fizz deadpanned, her blue hair sagging. "A stiff breeze will kill you. A particularly aggressive sneeze from a goblin will delete your save file. You are a glass cannon without the cannon part. You’re just... glass."

"But I have 100% Crit," Artie countered, his confidence returning as he processed the math. "That means every time I hit something, I hit it where it hurts. Every time. No RNG. No luck. Just... results."

"You’re an idiot," Fizz whispered.

[Title Unlocked: Crit or Quit]
[Effect: All damage dealt is guaranteed to be a Critical Hit. All damage received is guaranteed to be fatal.]

"See? The System even gave me a title," Artie said, patting the pocket of his trousers where his Smartphone and Leather Wallet were still stowed. "It’s practically an endorsement."

"It’s a warning label," Fizz snapped. "And now, because you’ve broken the tutorial before it even started, we’re being fast-tracked. The System doesn't want you in the void anymore. It wants you somewhere you can be 'balanced' by a monster."

The white static around them began to ripple and tear. The smell of ozone was replaced by the scent of damp grass and something vaguely sweet. The void was dissolving, replaced by rolling green hills and a sky that was a bit too blue to be natural.

"Welcome to the Slime Fields, Arthur," Fizz said, her wings buzzing with a frantic energy as she began to fade into her invisible 'Guide' mode. "Try not to trip on a pebble. I'm pretty sure that would count as crushing damage."

Artie stood on the new grass, his Corporate ID Badge swinging. He felt light. Terribly, dangerously light. 

"One HP," he whispered to himself, looking at a translucent green blob wobbling in the distance. "Well. Better not miss."

## The First Spawn

The transition from the absolute white of the System Void to the neon-green saturation of the Slime Fields felt like being slapped in the face with a wet, radioactive towel. Artie Penhaligon stumbled, his loafers skidding on grass that was a little too springy to be natural. He instinctively reached up to steady the Corporate ID Badge hanging from his neck. The plastic clicked against his chest, a comforting, mundane sound in a world that had abandoned the concept of "normal" three minutes ago.

"Welcome to the Tutorial Zone, User 001-ALPHA!" Fizz chirped, her tiny, glowing blue form zipping around Artie’s head like a caffeinated firefly. She left a trail of pixelated dust that smelled faintly of ozone and blueberry muffins. "Or as I like to call it: The Place Where Math Meets the Meat-Grinder. Isn't it picturesque?"

Artie squinted. The sky was a shade of cyan that suggested the atmosphere was made of Gatorade. In the distance, rolling hills of vibrant turf were dotted with trees that looked like they’d been copy-pasted by a developer who was five minutes away from a weekend bender.

"It’s... bright," Artie said, his voice raspy. He patted his sides, feeling the reassuring bulk of his Smartphone in his left pocket and his Leather Wallet in his right. He was still wearing his office attire—a rumpled button-down that now bore the scorched, jagged patterns of his untimely demise. The severe electrical burns on his chest throbbed with a dull, phantom heat, a reminder that he was technically a dead man walking.

[Location: The Slime Fields (Tutorial Zone)]
[Difficulty: Laughable (For most people)]
[Warning: Reality Stability is currently at 95%. Expect minor graphical artifacts.]

"Picturesque isn't the word I'd use," Artie muttered, looking down at his hands. He could see the faint keyboard callus on his right palm. "So, what’s the plan? I kill a few things, I get some levels, I find a way to stop being a walking heart-attack risk?"

Fizz landed on his shoulder, her weightless presence barely registering. "About that! Since you decided to play 'Optimal Spreadsheet' with your life, we should probably check your status. Just so you know exactly how much of a gentle breeze it’ll take to delete you."

Artie sighed and mentally willed the screen into existence.

[Name: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[Title: Crit or Quit]
[Level: 1]
[HP: 1/1]
[Crit Rate: 100%]
[Status: Glass Soul (Permanent)]

[Glass Soul: Your spirit is as sharp as a diamond and just as fragile. HP is locked at 1. All incoming damage—including environmental, status-based, or stubbed toes—is fatal. On the bright side, you’ll never have to worry about hospital bills.]

"One," Artie whispered, the word feeling heavy in his mouth. "I have one hit point. Fizz, I’ve had hangovers with more durability than this."

"Hey, you're the one who dumped sixty points into Critical Hit Rate!" Fizz reminded him, doing a somersault in the air. "You're a statistical god, Artie. You just happen to be a god made of wet tissue paper. Look! Your first fan is approaching."

Artie looked up. Emerging from behind a particularly blocky bush was a wobbling mound of translucent green jelly. It was about the size of a beach ball, with two vacant, black-dot eyes and a rhythmic pulse that made it look like a giant, sentient booger.

[Lesser Green Slime - Lvl 1]
[HP: 10/10]
[Status: Hungry]

The slime didn't roar. It made a sound like a plunger being pulled out of a sink. Schlorp. It began to undulate toward Artie, leaving a glistening trail of slime on the grass.

"Okay," Artie said, backing up a step. "It’s a slime. It’s a Level One slime. In every game I’ve ever played, these things are basically experience-point pinatas. I can handle this."

"Normally, yes," Fizz said, her voice dropping into a tone of mock-seriousness. "Normally, a Level One player can take about five or six hits from a Lesser Green Slime before they need a potion. But you? Artie, if that thing so much as sneezes in your general direction, you’re going back to the vending machine in the sky."

The slime accelerated. It wasn't fast, but it was persistent. It launched itself forward in a small hop, landing with a wet thud a few feet closer.

Artie felt a cold sweat break out on his neck. He looked around for a weapon—a stick, a rock, anything—but the Slime Fields were suspiciously well-manicured. 

"Wait, if I have a hundred percent crit rate, I just need to hit it once, right?" Artie asked, his heart hammering against his ribs.

"Technically, yes! But you have zero Strength, Artie. You're a 'slender' build with the physical power of a damp noodle. Your crits will multiply your damage, but ten times zero is still zero. You need to find a way to actually... you know... damage it."

The slime hopped again. This time, it cleared three feet. It was close enough now that Artie could smell it—a cloying, sugary scent like lime Jell-O left in the sun.

"Fizz, it's looking at me," Artie said, his voice rising an octave. "Why is it looking at me like that?"

"Because you're a Level One Anomaly and you look delicious! Also, you're standing in its path. Move, Artie! Use those legs!"

Artie scrambled backward, but his heel caught on a tuft of the springy grass. He flailed, his arms windmilling as he fought to keep his balance. His Corporate ID Badge swung wildly on its lanyard. He managed to stay upright, but the slime was now only five feet away. It paused, its body quivering as it prepared for a larger leap.

[Combat Log: Lesser Green Slime is charging 'Tutorial Bounce'!]

"Charging?" Artie yelled. "Since when do slimes charge?"

"Since you entered the world on 'Hardcore Mode'!" Fizz shouted back, retreating to a safe distance in the air. "Artie, listen to me. The Glass Soul isn't just a debuff. It’s a reality. You cannot be touched. Not by the slime, not by the grass if it’s too sharp, not by me if I accidentally glitch through you. You are a one-hit-point wonder. Act like it!"

The slime launched. 

It was a slow-motion nightmare. The green mass expanded as it flew through the air, its translucent body catching the Gatorade-blue sunlight. Artie dived to the right, feeling the rush of air as the slime sailed past his ear. He hit the ground hard, the impact jarring his bones.

[HP: 1/1]
[Warning: Impact registered. Durability check passed. Barely.]

Artie scrambled to his feet, his breath coming in ragged gasps. He looked at the slime, which had landed and was already turning around with a wet, squelching sound. It seemed faster now. More focused. 

"I can't do this," Artie panted, his eyes darting around the field. "I'm an accountant, Fizz! I track losses, I don't experience them personally!"

"Well, start accounting for your life, because here it comes again!"

The slime didn't hop this time. It began to stretch, its body elongating until it looked like a green serpent. It lashed out, a whip-like appendage of jelly snapping toward Artie’s ankles. Artie jumped—a clumsy, desperate hop—and the slime-whip whistled beneath his feet.

He landed in a patch of mud, his loafers sinking into the muck. He was cornered against a large, blocky rock that looked like it had been rendered with a low polygon count. The slime sensed his hesitation. It stopped lashing and began to expand, growing larger and larger as it pulled more mass from its own center. It was preparing for a full-body slam.

Artie backed up until his spine hit the cold, hard surface of the rock. He looked at the slime, then at his own trembling hands. He had no weapon. He had no armor. He had a Corporate ID Badge, a Smartphone, and a Leather Wallet. 

[Lesser Green Slime - Lvl 1]
[Status: Aggroed]
[Action: Tutorial Slam in 3... 2...]

"Fizz!" Artie screamed. "Advice! Now!"

"Don't get hit!" she yelled back, her blue glow flickering with excitement. "And maybe try to find the 'Crit' in 'Crit or Quit' before you become a floor stain!"

The slime launched itself, a wall of green jelly filling Artie’s vision. He realized, with a clarity that only comes to the terminally doomed, that this was it. One touch, and the game was over before the tutorial even finished.

The Lesser Green Slime didn’t just lunge; it performed a gravitational insult. 

It was a wobbling mass of translucent, neon-citrus phlegm that had spent the last thirty seconds cornering Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon against a jagged outcrop of rock. Now, it was mid-air, a "Tutorial Slam" in progress, and Artie’s entire life—all twenty-eight years of spreadsheets, lukewarm coffee, and that final, fatal argument with a vending machine—was about to be ended by a sentient puddle. The world around him, the Slime Fields, was a nauseating palette of oversaturated greens and purples, smelling faintly of sugar and ozone.

[Warning: Incoming Damage - 4 (Lethal)]
[Current HP: 1/1]
[Status: Glass Soul (Active)]

"Not like this," Artie wheezed, his lungs still feeling like they’d been scrubbed with steel wool from the electrocution that had sent him here. "I am not dying to a dessert topping."

He threw himself to the right. It wasn't a graceful roll. It was a panicked, flailing collapse that sent his slender frame face-first into the vibrant, glowing grass. The slime hit the rock behind him with a wet *thwack*, the sound of a giant steak being dropped onto a tile floor. The impact was so heavy it sent a tremor through the ground, vibrating up through Artie's pale chest where the severe electrical burns still throbbed with a phantom heat.

Artie scrambled to his feet, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird. The Corporate ID Badge clipped to his lanyard swung wildly, the plastic edge catching him in the chin with a sharp, annoying sting. He ignored it. He didn't have a sword. He didn't even have a sharpened pencil. He had two fists that had never hit anything harder than a 'Caps Lock' key. His mousy brown hair was matted with sweat and bits of neon grass, and his hazel eyes darted around the clearing, looking for an exit that wasn't blocked by undulating gelatin.

"Okay, Artie. Math. Focus on the math," he muttered, trying to steady his breathing. The creature was already re-inflating itself, its core—a dark, pea-sized nucleus—pulsing with a rhythmic, predatory light. "I have a hundred percent crit rate. That has to mean something, right? If I hit it, it breaks. It’s basic logic. It’s an if-then statement."

The slime jiggled. It looked like it was laughing, or perhaps just settling its internal mass for another strike.

Artie stepped forward, trying to channel every action movie he’d ever seen during his lunch breaks. He pulled his right fist back, his keyboard-calloused palm sweating, and launched a punch that he intended to be a jaw-shattering hook.

[Attack Initiated: Unarmed Strike]
[Accuracy Check: 12% (Poor Form)]

He swung so hard he actually spun. His fist whistled through the air, missing the slime’s core by a good six inches. The momentum carried him past the creature, and he nearly tripped over a protruding root.

[Miss #1: Over-extension]

"Calibration," Artie gasped, spinning back around and nearly losing his balance again. "Just a calibration swing. Establishing the parameters."

The slime bobbed, its surface shimmering under the artificial-looking sun of the tutorial zone. It seemed to be waiting for him, mocking his lack of coordination. Artie lunged again, this time with a straight jab. He kept his eyes open for approximately half a second before the sheer terror of the creature’s undulating, translucent surface made him flinch. His arm went limp, and he basically just waved at the monster.

[Miss #2: Flinch Reflex]

"Stop looking at me like that!" Artie yelled. The slime didn't have eyes, but he could feel the judgment radiating from its gelatinous bulk. It was the same look his manager used to give him when a pivot table collapsed. 

He tried a double-handed shove, hoping to at least knock the thing back and buy some space. He stepped into the neon-green slime trail the creature had left behind. His left foot went north, his right foot went nowhere, and he performed a frantic, mid-air dance that ended with him slapping the air where the slime had been a second ago.

[Miss #3: Environmental Slip]

The slime shifted, its core pulsing faster now. It was preparing another slam. Artie was running out of rock to hide behind and running out of dignity to lose. The weight of the Smartphone and Leather Wallet in his pockets felt like lead weights, dragging at his trousers as he struggled to regain his footing.

"Third time's the charm? No, that was three. Fourth! Fourth is... statistically significant!"

He charged. This wasn't a punch. This was a desperate, eyes-closed flail. He swung his left arm in a wide arc, his fist aimed at the center of the mass. The slime simply compressed itself, the top of its head dipping just low enough that Artie's knuckles scraped over the top of its sticky skin without actually registering a hit.

[Miss #4: Target Compression]

Artie was panting now, his slender frame reaching its limit. His Corporate ID Badge was tangled in his shirt, the lanyard choking him slightly. Every movement felt sluggish, like he was trying to fight through a vat of cold syrup. The system was watching, he knew. It was recording every failure, every pathetic gasp for air.

The slime launched. It was a low-altitude glide, aimed straight for his chest.

"Get! Away!" Artie screamed, throwing a frantic kick. 

He missed. Not just the slime, but the ground. He overcompensated for the creature's movement, his leg sailing through empty space, and he landed hard on his backside. The impact jarred his spine, sending a jolt of pain through his pale skin.

[Miss #5: Total Balance Failure]

The slime landed inches from his crotch, its surface vibrating with the intensity of a subwoofer. It was over. Artie was on the ground, 1 HP, and the tutorial monster was ready to deliver the final 'Tutorial Slam'. The air was thick with the scent of citrus-flavored doom.

[System Notification: Combat Efficiency < 0.01%]
[System Query: Would you like to enable 'Toddler Mode'? (Y/N)]

"Screw you," Artie hissed at the floating text, his hazel eyes narrowing with a sudden, sharp spark of spite. 

The slime reared back, expanding to twice its size. It was a wall of green death, a wobbling executioner. Artie didn't have time to stand. He didn't have time to aim. He didn't have time to think about form or accuracy or the fact that he was about to die to a level one mob. He just reached out with his right hand—the one with the keyboard callus—and gave the slime a weak, pathetic shove, as if he were trying to move a slightly annoying person out of his way at the deli counter.

It was the most half-hearted attack in the history of the multiverse.

[Attack Initiated: Pathetic Shove]
[Accuracy Check: ...Calculating...]
[Glitch Detected: Statistical Inevitability Triggered]
[Critical Hit! (100% Rate Guaranteed)]

The moment Artie's palm touched the slime’s surface, the world didn't just stop; it stuttered. 

The neon-green grass turned into a smear of static. The air smelled suddenly of burnt silicon and high-voltage discharge. A sound like a thousand glass windows shattering at once erupted from the point of contact, a cacophony of breaking code and shattered physics. 

[Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit!]
[Damage Calculation: 1.2e+12]
[Overkill Calculator: 9,999,999,999% Efficiency]

A pillar of white, blinding light erupted from Artie's hand. It didn't just hit the slime; it erased it. The Lesser Green Slime didn't pop or splatter; it simply ceased to be, its data overwritten by a surge of pure mathematical fury. The light continued, a horizontal spear of radiance that tore through the Slime Fields with the force of a collapsing star. 

Twenty feet behind where the slime had been, a massive, ancient-looking oak tree stood. Or it had stood. The beam of the crit hit the trunk, and the tree didn't fall. It disintegrated. The wood turned to ash, then the ash turned to light, and then there was just a perfectly circular hole where a forest giant had been a second ago. The ground beneath the beam's path was scorched into a glass-like trench.

The shockwave knocked Artie backward, his head ringing with a high-pitched whine. He scrambled away from the smoking line of scorched earth that now cut through the tutorial zone, his eyes wide with terror and awe. 

[System Notification: Enemy Deleted.]
[Calculating Experience...]
[Error: Experience exceeds local buffer. Truncating...]
[Level Up!]

Artie stared at the crater. A single, charred leaf drifted down from the sky, landing on his nose. He brushed it off with a trembling hand, looking down at his palm. It was perfectly fine. No burns, no scratches. Just the same faint keyboard callus he’d had since college. But where the slime had been, there was now a smoking, blackened pit in the earth, and the smell of ozone was thick enough to taste.

[Status Update: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[Level: 2]
[HP: 1/1 (Glass Soul)]
[Crit Rate: 100% (Anomaly)]

"I... I think I broke the tutorial," Artie whispered, his voice cracking.

He sat there for a long time, the Corporate ID Badge finally coming to a rest against his chest. He was Level 2. He was alive. And he was officially the most dangerous thing in this world—mostly because he had no idea how to stop what he had just started. The Slime Fields were quiet now, the remaining slimes having retreated into the tall grass, seemingly aware that the rules of their world had just been violently rewritten.

[Title Progress: 'One-Hit Wonder' - 1/10]
[System Note: Please try to leave some of the environment for the other players. This is a shared space.]

Artie looked at the smoking hole in the tree and then back at his hand. The spreadsheet wizardry of his old life felt like a distant, dusty memory compared to the raw, glitchy power he now held. He wasn't just a player anymore; he was a walking error message.

The smoke from the vaporized oak tree tasted like ozone and charcoal, a gritty reminder that Artie’s right hand was now legally a weapon of mass destruction. He stood in the center of a scorched, blackened trench, his chest heaving. Every breath felt like dragging a wire brush through his lungs, but his HP bar remained a steady, terrifying 1/1.

"Well," Fizz chirped, fluttering down from a safe distance. She hovered just outside the lingering heat haze, her pixelated wings shimmering. "That was certainly... a choice. Most people use a sword. You used a glitch in the fundamental laws of mathematics."

Artie wiped soot from his forehead, leaving a dark smear across his pale skin. "I didn't mean to delete the geography, Fizz. I just wanted the slime to stop looking at me like I was a snack."

[Quest Complete: Tutorial Combat 101]
[Reward: Overkill Bonus Calculated...]
[Processing... Processing... System Error: Math.div(0) avoided by rounding up to 'Absurd'.]

A chime like a broken xylophone echoed through the fields. In front of Artie, the air rippled, and a heavy, metallic object materialized with a thud. It was a trophy—a cheap-looking, gold-plated plastic cup mounted on a base of simulated marble. It glowed with a sickly, neon-purple light that seemed to pulse in time with Artie’s heartbeat.

[Item Acquired: Participation Trophy]
[Quality: Trash (Cursed)]
[Description: Congratulations! You broke the tutorial. This item serves as a permanent beacon for every monster in the zone who feels personally insulted by your existence.]

Artie reached down and gripped the cold, vibrating stem of the Participation Trophy with his right hand. The moment his fingers closed around it, the purple glow intensified, shooting a beam of light straight into the sky like a flare.

"Oh, that's not good," Fizz said, her voice dropping an octave. "That’s really, really not good."

"Why is it glowing, Fizz? Why is my reward a lighthouse for murder?"

[System Notification: Level Up!]
[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon has reached Level 3!]
[Stat Points Gained: 5 (Held for anomaly verification)]

Artie didn't have time to celebrate the 'ding.' A low, rhythmic thrumming began to vibrate through the soles of his shoes. It wasn't the wind. It was the sound of ten thousand gelatinous bodies hitting the grass at once.

[Aggro Meter: 100% (MAXIMUM)]
[Zone Alert: Slime Migration Inbound. Current Target: Statistical Anomaly #001.]

"Artie," Fizz said, her tiny blue hands pointing toward the horizon. "You remember how I said the slimes were passive unless provoked?"

"Yeah?"

"You just provoked the entire ecosystem."

On the crest of the surrounding hills, the green horizon began to bulge. Hundreds—no, thousands—of Lesser Green Slimes were cresting the ridge. They weren't wobbling aimlessly anymore. They were moving with a terrifying, synchronized purpose, their translucent bodies glistening under the purple light of the Participation Trophy.

"Run?" Artie asked, his voice cracking.

"Run," Fizz confirmed.

Artie didn't wait for a second opinion. He bolted. He sprinted down the scorched trench, the Participation Trophy clutched tightly in his right hand. Every time the trophy struck his thigh, it emitted a high-pitched *ping* that seemed to act as a homing signal. 

Behind him, the Slime Fields had turned into a literal sea of green. The sound of their collective movement was a wet, squelching roar. 

[Warning: Stamina Depleting]
[Stamina: 45/100]

"Put the trophy away!" Artie wheezed, his mousy brown hair plastered to his forehead with sweat.

"You can't!" Fizz shouted, flying alongside his head. "It’s soul-bound and 'Always-Equipped' until you reach a Safe Zone. It’s part of the curse! You’re the shiny new toy, Artie, and the toddlers are coming to play!"

He looked back. The lead slimes were gaining. They were launching themselves through the air in long, parabolic arcs, their bodies stretching into lethal green teardrops. One landed inches from his heels, the impact cratering the soft earth. 

Artie swerved, nearly tripping over a protruding root. His 1 HP build meant that if even a single drop of that acidic slime touched his skin, the "Glass Soul" condition would shatter his existence. He was a Level 3 god of destruction who could be killed by a stray sneeze.

"The gate!" Fizz screamed, pointing toward a distant stone archway flickering on the edge of the zone. "Oakhaven! If you cross the threshold, the zone-aggro resets!"

"How far?" Artie gasped.

[Distance to Oakhaven Gate: 400 Meters]
[Slime Proximity: 12 Meters and Closing]

"I hate this game!" Artie yelled, his lungs burning as he pushed his slender frame to its absolute limit. "I want a refund! I want to talk to the manager!"

[System Response: Manager is currently busy laughing. Please hold your Participation Trophy higher so the slimes can see it better.]

The purple light flared again, blindingly bright, as the first wave of slimes prepared to leap.

## The Safe Zone?

The wet, rhythmic *thwip-slap* of ten thousand gelatinous bodies hitting the dirt was a sound Artie Penhaligon hoped to never hear again as long as he lived—which, given his current health pool, was likely to be about another thirty seconds if he didn't pick up the pace. 

His lungs were screaming. Not the metaphorical "I should have done more cardio" scream, but a jagged, white-hot agony that felt like he was inhaling ground glass. Every time his feet hit the packed earth of the trail, a little yellow bar in the corner of his vision flickered and dipped.

[Stamina: 14/100]

"Faster, Artie! They're gaining! And they look hungry! Or, well, they look like they want to absorb you into their collective mass, which is basically the same thing for a guy with one hit point!" Fizz was zipping around his head, her neon blue hair trailing pixelated sparks like a faulty firework. 

"I'm... trying!" Artie wheezed. He tightened his grip on the Participation Trophy. The gold-plated plastic felt cheap and oily in his right hand, pulsing with a rhythmic, sickly green light that seemed to act as a homing beacon for every slime within a three-mile radius. In his left hand, he clutched the strap of his lanyard, the Corporate ID Badge flapping against his chest like a frantic, plastic heart. 

[Warning: 'Beacon of Trash' is active.]
[Current Aggro Multiplier: 1000%]

"Can't I... just drop it?" Artie gasped, his boots skidding on a patch of loose gravel.

"Soul-bound, remember?" Fizz chirped, doing a celebratory loop-de-loop. "The System loves a winner, and you won the 'Most Likely to Break the Physics Engine' award! You and that trophy are best friends forever. Or until you die. Which, again, looking at that stamina bar..."

[Stamina: 8/100]
(Warning: Critical Exhaustion Imminent)

The horizon finally offered a reprieve: the towering, timber-and-stone walls of Oakhaven. Two massive oak gates stood open, flanked by guards in gleaming plate mail who looked significantly more competent than the slimes. 

Artie didn't stop. He couldn't. If he stopped, the momentum of his own panic would probably tip him over, and with a Max HP of 1, the impact with the ground might actually count as a finishing blow. 

"Help!" he croaked, stumbling toward the threshold. 

The guards didn't draw their swords. Instead, they stepped back, one of them raising a hand toward a floating crystal embedded in the archway. "Whoa, whoa! Slow down, Traveler! State your business and—holy mother of RNG, look at the trail on that one!"

Artie collapsed just past the threshold, his knees hitting the cobblestones with a jarring thud. He skidded a few feet, the Participation Trophy clattering against the stones but remaining firmly in his grasp. Behind him, at the edge of the 'Safe Zone' line, the sea of slimes hit an invisible wall and began to pile up, a roiling wall of translucent green spite.

[Stamina: 2/100]
[Status: Safe Zone Entered. Aggro Reset.]

Artie rolled onto his back, staring up at the sky. His mousy brown hair was matted with sweat, and his hazel eyes were wide with the kind of shell-shocked stare usually reserved for middle managers during a surprise fiscal audit. The severe electrical burns on his chest, a permanent souvenir from the vending machine that had sent him here, throbbed in time with his racing heart.

"I made it," he whispered. "I'm alive."

"For now," Fizz said, landing on his nose. "But you might want to look up. The welcoming committee looks... confused."

Artie blinked. The two guards were standing over him, but they weren't looking at him. They were looking at a translucent blue pane of light that had projected itself from the gate's crystal.

"Is the scanner broken?" the first guard asked, poking the air. 

"Shouldn't be," the second replied, squinting. "But look at these readings. It’s saying he’s Level 3, but his durability rating is... zero? No, wait. It says 'N/A'. And his luck stat is just a series of question marks."

The crystal above the gate began to hum, shifting from a calm blue to a strobing, agitated violet. 

[System Notification: Security Scan in Progress...]
[Target: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[Analyzing Statistical Variance...]

"Hey, what's that thing doing?" Artie asked, trying to push himself up. He felt for his Smartphone in his left pocket and his Leather Wallet in his right, a reflexive check for his mundane belongings. They were still there, small comforts in a world that was currently trying to calculate his existence.

"It's the Gatekeeper Scan," Fizz explained, her voice losing its playful edge. "It checks for gear level, stat alignment, and—"

The humming reached a crescendo. A giant, red box materialized in the air above Artie's head, pulsing with the intensity of a dying sun.

[CRITICAL ERROR: STATISTICAL ANOMALY DETECTED]
[Variance Threshold Exceeded: 99.99%]
[Build Identity: 'Crit or Quit']
[Status: Flagged for Administrative Review]

The guards moved then, their spears leveling at Artie's chest. "Nobody moves! We’ve got a glitcher!"

Artie looked from the spears to the red box, then at the glowing Participation Trophy in his hand. "I can explain," he said, his voice cracking. "It was the vending machine's fault."

The stool groaned under Artie’s weight, a sound that felt dangerously like a physical attack against his remaining health. He didn’t collapse, mostly because collapsing required more stamina than he currently possessed, but he did let his forehead rest against the cool, scarred wood of the bar. 

[HP: 1/1]
[Stamina: 5/100]
[Status: Exhausted - All physical actions cost 2x Stamina]

"You look like something a Level 100 Necromancer coughed up," a gravelly voice observed.

Artie didn't look up. He just tightened his grip on the Participation Trophy, the cheap gold-painted plastic feeling absurdly heavy in his right hand. The cursed item was still humming with that low-grade "come kill me" energy, but inside the walls of Oakhaven, the effect felt muffled, like a radio station losing its signal.

"I was detained," Artie muttered into the wood. "Administrative review. Apparently, having a heart that beats in binary is a security risk."

A heavy thud echoed as a wooden mug was placed in front of him. Artie finally raised his head, blinking his hazel eyes against the dim, amber light of the tavern. Standing behind the bar was a man who looked like he’d been carved out of an old oak stump. Barnaby was short, stocky, and possessed a salt-and-pepper beard so thick it probably had its own defensive stat. He was currently clenching a Wooden Pipe between his teeth, though he wasn't lighting it.

"The gate guards mentioned a 'Statistical Anomaly' was headed my way," Barnaby said, his dark brown eyes scanning Artie with the practiced ease of a man who spent his life looking at price tags. "They didn't mention you were dressed like a middle-manager who got lost on the way to a spreadsheet convention."

Artie glanced down at his chest. The Corporate ID Badge still dangled from the lanyard around his neck, the plastic flickering with a faint, ghostly light. Underneath it, the severe electrical burns from the vending machine accident were hidden by his singed shirt, but the memory of the shock still made his skin crawl.

"It’s a vintage look," Artie said, his voice cracking. "Very exclusive. Only one in existence, hopefully."

Barnaby leaned in, his weathered face inches from Artie’s. He didn't look at Artie’s face; he looked just above his head, squinting at the invisible UI elements that only certain NPCs and high-level players could see.

[Skill Active: Appraisal (Rank B)]

"One HP," Barnaby whispered, the Wooden Pipe nearly falling from his mouth. "And a Crit Rate of... one hundred percent? Lad, you’re not a player. You’re a walking math error."

"I prefer the term 'optimal build,'" Artie lied. 

"Optimal?" Barnaby let out a bark of a laugh that sounded like stones grinding together. "You’re a glass cannon made of actual glass. One stiff breeze, one misplaced pebble, or one particularly aggressive sneeze from a barmaid and you’re a loot drop. Do you have any idea what you are in this town?"

Artie took a tentative sip of whatever was in the mug. It tasted like fermented apples and bad math. 

[Stamina: +5]

"A nuisance?" Artie suggested.

"A whale," Barnaby corrected, his expression turning uncharacteristically serious. "In Oakhaven, 'Crits' aren't just a combat mechanic. They're the backbone of the local economy. The nobility here? They don't pray for rain or peace. They pray for high rolls. A man who can guarantee a Critical Hit every time he swings a fist? You’re not a hero, Artie. You’re a resource."

Artie felt a cold lump form in his stomach that had nothing to do with the cider. He reached into his right pocket, feeling the familiar edges of his Leather Wallet. It was empty of this world's currency, but it felt like a tether to a reality where 'Critical Hits' were just something that happened to other people's cars.

"I just want a place to hide," Artie said. "Somewhere with a very high ceiling and zero sharp corners."

Barnaby sighed, finally lighting his pipe. A cloud of sweet-smelling smoke drifted between them. "Safety is expensive, lad. And you? You're glowing like a neon sign in a dark alley. That scanner at the gate didn't just flag you for the guards. It logged your stats into the local registry. By tomorrow morning, every 'talent scout' and 'mentor' in the city is going to be looking for the Level 3 glitch with the hundred-percent hit rate."

Artie looked at the Participation Trophy in his hand. He’d won it for surviving a slime-pocalypse, but now it felt like a target painted on his back. He thought about his Smartphone in his left pocket, useless and dead, a relic of a world where the only thing he had to worry about was his 401k.

"So, what you're saying is," Artie said, his voice dropping to a whisper, "I'm basically a winning lottery ticket that can be killed by a papercut."

"Exactly," Barnaby said, tapping his pipe against the bar. "And in this world, people don't wait for the lottery to draw. They just take the ticket."

Artie looked around the tavern. For the first time, the cozy atmosphere felt predatory. The shadows in the corners seemed a little deeper, the eyes of the other patrons a little sharper. He wasn't just a player in a game anymore. He was a glitch in a system that hated being broken, and a prize for anyone strong enough to claim him.

[New Title Progress: One-Hit Wonder (2/10)]
[Warning: Your presence has been logged by the Oakhaven Census Bureau.]

"Great," Artie muttered, resting his head back on the bar. "I finally get to be a VIP, and the 'P' stands for 'Prey'."

The temperature in Barnaby’s tavern didn't just drop; it plummeted with the weight of a lead coffin. One moment, Artie was nursing the dregs of a drink that tasted like fermented swamp water, and the next, the air felt thick enough to chew. The chatter of the local drunks died in their throats as the heavy oak doors creaked open.

[Vane - Lvl 52] [Title: The Unbroken Blade]

The man who stepped inside was less a person and more a localized weather event of pure arrogance. He was tall, his athletic frame encased in polished black plate armor that seemed to suck the flickering candlelight right out of the room. A jagged scar crossed the bridge of his nose, punctuating a face that looked like it had been carved out of granite and then taught how to sneer. On his back, the hilt of a massive blade—the Ebon Claymore—towered over his shoulder, the dark metal etched with faint, pulsing runes.

Artie felt a familiar, unwelcome vibration in his marrow. It wasn't the vending machine this time; it was the System screaming a warning.

[Effect: Aura of Intimidation (Rank B) - Stamina Drain: 1/sec]

"Great," Artie wheezed, his lungs feeling like they were being squeezed by a giant invisible hand. "I survived a slime-pocalypse for this? My health bar is a single pixel, and now the room is trying to sit on me."

Vane didn't look at the tavern keeper. He didn't look at the terrified regulars. His piercing grey eyes locked onto Artie, or more specifically, the violet shimmer that still clung to Artie's skin from the gate scanners.

"An anomaly," Vane said, his voice a low rumble that made the ale in Artie's mug ripple. He crossed the floor in three strides, the Ebon Claymore clinking softly against his greaves. He stopped a foot away from Artie, the sheer level difference creating a physical pressure that forced Artie back against the bar. "The census log mentioned a glitch in the math. A 'Crit or Quit' build. I thought it was a clerical error."

"Usually, I'm the one making the clerical errors," Artie said, clutching his Participation Trophy like a shield. The gold-plated plastic felt pathetically light against the presence of a man who could likely delete him by blinking too hard. "Look, if you're here about the trophy, it’s soul-bound. Believe me, I’ve tried to lose it."

Vane ignored the joke, his gaze drifting to the Corporate ID Badge dangling from Artie's neck. "You’re raw data. Unrefined. A hundred-percent crit rate in the hands of a level three peasant is a waste of the System’s resources." He leaned in, his shadow swallowing Artie whole. "You need a handler. Someone to point that glitch in a direction that matters."

"I have a direction," Artie countered, his heart hammering against his ribs. "It’s called 'away.' I’m very fond of it."

Vane’s lip curled. He reached out, his gauntleted hand hovering inches from Artie’s chest. 

[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon - Lvl 3] [HP: 1/1]

The high-level warrior paused, a look of genuine confusion—and then dark amusement—flickering across his face. "One hit point? You’re a Glass Soul. One stray spark and you’re a memory."

"I prefer the term 'statistically efficient,'" Artie snapped.

Vane straightened, his hand dropping to the hilt of his weapon. "Efficiency requires survival. You won't last a week in the wild without a leash. I'm claiming your contract, Anomaly. Consider it a mercy."

[System Notification: Formal Duel Requested by Vane (Lvl 52)]
[Terms: Winner gains ownership of 'The Anomaly'.]
[Warning: Level disparity exceeds 40. Auto-forfeit is disabled for Anomalies.]

"Ownership? I’m not a used sedan," Artie said, his eyes darting toward the door. His stamina was ticking down into the red. 

[Stamina: 4/100]

"You are whatever I say you are," Vane replied. "Accept the challenge, or I’ll simply follow you until something smaller than me accidentally kills you. Then I’ll harvest your remains for the Crit-essence."

"Option C," Artie whispered. He looked at Barnaby, who was wisely polishing a glass behind the bar as if he had suddenly gone deaf and blind. Artie looked back at Vane, then down at the Participation Trophy in his right hand. "Hey, look! A patch update!"

Vane instinctively glanced toward his own UI. It was a half-second distraction, but for a man who lived on the edge of a 1 HP cliff, half a second was an eternity. Artie didn't run; he scrambled. He dived between Vane’s legs, his slender frame easily clearing the gap beneath the heavy plate armor. 

He hit the floor, rolled, and bolted for the door.

"You can't outrun the System, Penhaligon!" Vane’s roar followed him, vibrating the tavern walls. "The challenge is logged! You’re mine!"

Artie didn't look back. He burst through the tavern doors and into the cool Oakhaven night, his lungs burning and his vision swimming. He had a level 52 paladin on his tail, a cursed Participation Trophy in his hand, and a health bar that couldn't survive a stiff breeze.

"Still better than the office," he gasped, disappearing into the shadows of the alleyways.
