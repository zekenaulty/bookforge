# Chapter 1: Welcome to the RNG-Hellscape

## The Exit Interview

The Snack-O-Matic 3000 was a liar, a thief, and quite possibly the primary antagonist of Arthur Penhaligon’s Tuesday. 

Artie stared through the scratched plexiglass at the bag of Zesty Ranch Habanero Hoops. It wasn't just sitting there; it was mocking him. The bag was suspended by a literal quarter-turn of a rusted metal coil, dangling over the precipice of the delivery chute like a cinematic hero holding onto a ledge by his fingernails. Except in this movie, the hero was a nitrogen-flushed bag of corn-based snacks, and the villain was a forty-year-old office worker who just wanted his damn lunch.

"Are you kidding me?" Artie muttered, his breath fogging the plastic. "I paid for the 'Zesty.' I paid for the 'Habanero.' I even paid for the 'Hoops.' Where are my Hoops, Dave?"

The machine didn't answer. It just hummed with the low-frequency vibration of a device that hadn't been serviced since the Clinton administration. The digital display, a flickering green relic of a bygone era, simply blinked: **CREDIT: $0.00**.

That was the lie. Artie had inserted a dollar. A crisp, relatively un-crumpled George Washington. He had watched the machine inhale it, hesitate, and then decide that it wasn't a dollar at all, but rather a gift. A tribute. A sacrifice to the gods of processed sodium.

"We aren't doing this today," Artie said, his voice rising to a pitch that usually signaled a pending HR meeting. "I have had three cups of lukewarm coffee, two spreadsheets that refuse to balance, and a boss who unironically uses the phrase 'synergistic paradigm shift.' I will have my Hoops."

He checked the breakroom. Empty. The fluorescent lights overhead hummed in sympathy with the machine, flickering with a rhythmic instability that suggested the building’s wiring was held together by hope and electrical tape. Artie leaned his shoulder against the side of the Snack-O-Matic.

In the world of corporate survival, Artie knew there were two types of people: those who saw a 'Stuck' sign and walked away, and those who recognized that the System was rigged and decided to break the System back. He was the latter. This wasn't about the ninety-nine cents plus tax. This was about the principle of the thing. This was about the RNG of life finally going his way for once.

He gave the machine a firm, measured shove.

The Hoops didn't budge. If anything, the vibration of the impact seemed to settle them more firmly onto the coil.

"Oh, so it's a boss fight then?" Artie adjusted his glasses. "Fine. Phase two."

He grabbed the edges of the machine, his fingers finding purchase in the grime-coated vents on the side. He began to rock it. It was a delicate art—too much force and the whole thing would tip over and crush him, which would be an embarrassing way to go, even by his standards. Too little, and the Hoops would remain in their plastic purgatory.

*Clunk. Whirr.*

The machine groaned. Inside, the coil shifted a fraction of a millimeter. The bag of Hoops swayed. 

"Yes," Artie hissed. "Gravity. The only law that actually works in this building. Come to papa."

He gave it one more violent heave, putting his entire weight into the momentum. He felt a sudden, sharp resistance, followed by a sound like a synthesizer dying in a bathtub. 

The lights in the breakroom didn't just flicker; they surged. The hum of the Snack-O-Matic jumped an octave, then two, turning into a screeching whine that vibrated in Artie's teeth. A smell of ozone and burnt hair filled the air—the universal scent of a terrible mistake.

"Uh oh," Artie said. 

He tried to let go, but his hands were locked. A blue-white arc of electricity jumped from the 'Coin Return' slot directly into his palm. It wasn't like a static shock. It was like being hit by a freight train made of pure, unadulterated math. 

His vision didn't go black. It went white. A searing, clinical, high-definition white that made his retinas scream. 

The sound of the office—the distant clicking of keyboards, the muffled roar of the HVAC, the squeak of Brenda’s ergonomic chair—vanished. It was replaced by a single, resonant tone.

[SYSTEM NOTIFICATION: CRITICAL ERROR - SYSTEM OVERLOAD]

The words didn't appear in front of him; they appeared *inside* his head, rendered in a font that looked suspiciously like the one used by the very vending machine that was currently liquefying his nervous system.

[USER: PENHALIGON, ARTHUR - STATUS: TERMINATED]

"Terminated?" Artie tried to shout, but he didn't have lungs anymore. He didn't have a throat. He was just a collection of thoughts floating in a sea of bleach. "I'm not fired! I'm... oh. Oh, that kind of terminated."

[RECALCULATING...]
[RNG THRESHOLD EXCEEDED]
[INITIATING EMERGENCY PROTOCOL: 'THE GREAT LOGIN SCREEN IN THE SKY']

The white void rippled. As the reality of the breakroom dissolved, Artie felt his corporate attire unravel. His poly-blend shirt coarsened, the fibers thickening into a rough, cream-colored Linen Tunic. The weight of his wallet vanished, replaced by the distinct, heavy clink of a Single Copper Coin settling into a new pocket.

Most jarringly, his right hand—the one that had been fused to the Snack-O-Matic—clenched around a hilt. It was cold, heavy, and metallic. As the light stabilized, he looked down to see a Broken Tutorial Sword gripped in his hand.

The last thing Artie thought before the transition finalized was a singular, burning regret. 

*I never got my Hoops.*

Then, the world shifted. The white void stabilized, and Artie stood in the silence of the System, waiting for the next prompt.

The white void was less of a room and more of a conceptual error. Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stood in the center of the nothingness, looking down at his new attire. The sensible, charcoal-grey slacks of a Senior Logistics Analyst were gone, replaced by a simple Linen Tunic that was surprisingly soft but offered the structural integrity of a wet paper towel. 

He shifted the weight of the Broken Tutorial Sword in his right hand. It was a jagged, rusted length of iron that felt less like a weapon and more like a tetanus shot waiting to happen. In his pocket, a single copper coin clinked—his entire net worth in this new, absurd reality.

"I’m going to need to see a manager," Artie said to the emptiness. "Or at least a technician. I’m fairly certain my death was a result of faulty wiring in the Snack-O-Matic 3000, which constitutes a gross violation of workplace safety standards."

"Actually, it constitutes a gross violation of common sense," a voice chirped from behind him.

Artie spun around, his sandals slapping against the invisible floor. A girl—or a very convincing holographic approximation of one—was hovering a few feet away. She was draped in a cloak of shimmering, translucent code, and her eyes were literal glowing asterisks that flickered as she scrolled through a translucent Data Slate held in her left hand.

"I’m Fizz," she said, her tone dripping with the kind of boredom usually reserved for DMV employees. "Your System Liaison. I’m here to make sure you don't immediately delete yourself, though looking at your file, that might be an uphill battle. Arthur Penhaligon, right? The guy who lost a wrestling match with a vending machine?"

"It was a draw," Artie corrected, lifting his chin. "The machine is also dead. I took it down with me."

Fizz snorted, tapping her Data Slate. "Let's see what the official record says." She flicked her wrist, and a window manifested in the air between them.

[System Notification: Death Report]
[Subject: Penhaligon, Arthur]
[Cause of Death: Kinetic-Electrical Feedback Loop (Vending Machine Malfunction)]
[Final Words: 'I paid for the Habanero Hoops, you bucket of bolts!']
[Status: Isekai-Eligible (Pity Tier)]

"Pity tier?" Artie echoed, his face reddening. "I had a spreadsheet for my spreadsheets, Fizz. I was the king of optimization. I could find a three-percent margin in a desert."

"Great," Fizz said, waving the report away. "Then you’ll love this. It’s time for character creation. You have fifty points to spend. Try not to put them all into 'Whining,' it’s a hidden stat and the scaling is terrible."

A massive blue UI panel shimmered into existence.

[Character Creation: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[Class: Unassigned]
[Level: 1]

[Attributes]
[Strength: 5] (+) (-)
[Agility: 5] (+) (-)
[Intelligence: 5] (+) (-)
[Vitality: 5] (+) (-)
[Luck: 5] (+) (-)

[Available Points: 50]

Artie stared at the numbers. "Five? That’s it? That’s the baseline for a human being?"

"It’s the 'Standard Mediocrity' package," Fizz said, leaning back in the air as if it were a recliner. "Most people put their points into Vitality. You know, so they don't die when a slime sneezes on them. But hey, you’re the optimization guy. Go nuts."

Artie didn't look at Vitality. He was scrolling through the sub-menus, his eyes darting across the fine print of the System’s logic. He found a tab labeled [Variance & Probability]. Inside was a single, golden slider: **Critical Hit Affinity.**

"Fizz," Artie said, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "What’s the exchange rate on Luck?"

"Luck?" Fizz glanced over, her asterisk-eyes narrowing. "It’s a trap stat. One point of Luck costs five Attribute Points. It governs your 'Critical' outcomes. If you max it, you’ll hit like a truck, but you’ll have the durability of a soap bubble. The System balances the math, Artie. You can't have high variance and high stability."

Artie looked at the Broken Tutorial Sword. He thought about the vending machine—how he’d shaken it and shaken it, and it hadn't budged until the surge hit. He didn't want stability. He wanted the surge.

"If I never get hit," Artie mused, "I don't need health. And if every hit is a Critical Hit, I don't need Strength."

"Artie, don't," Fizz said, her boredom finally giving way to a flicker of alarm.

Artie’s finger blurred. He didn't just spend his fifty points; he began hitting the minus signs on his other stats. He drained his Strength to one. He drained his Agility, his Intelligence, and finally, his Vitality. The points flooded into the Luck slider, pushing it higher and higher until the UI began to pulse with a frantic, red light.

[WARNING: Stat Imbalance Detected]
[WARNING: Vitality dropping below Recommended Minimum (10)]
[WARNING: Physical Integrity at Risk]

"You’re going to spawn in as a ghost!" Fizz shouted, reaching for the screen. "Stop!"

Artie’s finger hovered over the final confirmation. "Optimization, Fizz. It’s all about the margins."

He slammed his hand against the [CONFIRM] button.

The white void didn't just groan; it shrieked. A pillar of golden light erupted from the menu, engulfing Artie. He felt his very essence being stretched thin, his physical form becoming light and airy, as if he were made of nothing but potential and math.

[System Notification: Build Confirmed]

[MP: 1/1]
[Critical Hit Rate: 100%]
[Critical Hit Multiplier: 500%]

The light faded. Artie stood there, feeling... fragile. He looked at his hands; they were slightly translucent, the white void visible through his palms. He gripped the Broken Tutorial Sword, and a faint, golden hum vibrated through the hilt.

Fizz stared at him, her Data Slate frozen in mid-air. "One," she whispered. "You have one hit point, Artie. If you stub your toe, you’re going to explode. If a bird poops on you, it’s a Game Over. You are literally the most fragile thing in the history of the multiverse."

Artie smiled, though even the effort of smiling felt like it might cost him half his stamina. "But did you see the multiplier, Fizz? Five hundred percent. Every time I swing this rusted piece of junk, it’s going to hit with the force of a falling moon."

"Assuming you survive the swing," Fizz muttered, her fingers flying across her slate as she tried to recalibrate her sensors. "Fine. You want to play the 'Crit or Quit' game? Let’s see how long you last. Initiating deployment to Tutorial Zone: The Whispering Woods."

"Wait, already?" Artie asked, his knees wobbling slightly from his lack of Strength.

"The System doesn't like anomalies," Fizz said, her image beginning to flicker. "It wants to 'resolve' you as quickly as possible. Good luck, Artie. I’ll start drafting your next obituary."

The white void began to dissolve, the floor falling away into a swirling vortex of green and brown. Artie clutched his broken sword and his single copper coin, bracing himself as the world rushed up to meet him.

## The First Spawn

The moss beneath Artie’s boots felt like recycled polyester, a synthetic crunch echoing through the neon-tinged silence of the Whispering Woods. Above, the canopy didn't just rustle; it hissed with the sound of thousands of overlapping voices reciting patch notes in a low, digital monotone. *...fixed a bug where squirrels could phase through reality... increased drop rate for low-quality acorns... optimized shadow rendering for predatory bushes...*

Artie stood frozen, his fingers white-knuckled around the hilt of the Broken Tutorial Sword already gripped in his right hand. The jagged piece of rusted iron felt heavier than it had any right to be, a physical manifestation of his 1 Strength stat. He didn't dare move, not after his last tentative step had triggered a flickering [System Notification: Stealth Check Failed!] that mocked his lack of Agility.

In the upper-left corner of his vision, the translucent red bar was a constant, terrifying reminder of his choices. It was so thin it looked like a stray hair caught on his cornea, a fragile thread of existence that the System deemed sufficient for a 'Statistical Anomaly'.

[HP: 1 / 1]
[MP: 1 / 1]

"One," Artie whispered, his voice barely audible over the mechanical hissing of the leaves. "It’s really just one."

"It’s a very sturdy one," Fizz said, hovering a few feet away. She was tapping away at her Data Slate, the blue light of the screen reflecting off her wings in sharp, jagged patterns. "Technically, it's a whole number. It’s significantly better than zero. Although, in this zone, the difference between one and zero is usually about three kilograms of force or a particularly aggressive sneeze."

She looked up from her slate, her eyes tracking the Level 1 Slime that was currently vibrating in the center of the clearing. The creature was a translucent, lime-green mass of semi-solid sludge, about the size of a beach ball. Inside its gelatinous body, Artie could see the half-dissolved remains of a tutorial handbook and what looked like a very surprised-looking crow. Two black, bead-like eyes drifted lazily within the goo, eventually settling on Artie with a mindless, predatory focus.

[Tutorial Slime - Lvl 1]
[HP: 10/10]
[Status: Aggressive]

"Right," Artie said, trying to find a center he wasn't sure he possessed. "One hundred percent crit rate. That’s the plan. I just need to hit it before it hits me."

"A bold strategy, Cotton," Fizz muttered, her wings buzzing with a sound like a cooling fan. "Just a friendly reminder: that slime’s 'Passive Ooze' aura deals 0.1 damage per second to anything within a one-meter radius. Since the System rounds up for damage calculations..."

Artie’s eyes widened, his gaze darting from the slime to the invisible boundary Fizz was describing. "Wait, what? Rounds up? You mean 0.1 becomes...?"

"One," Fizz confirmed with a grin that was entirely too cheerful for the situation. "Math is a cruel mistress, Artie. If it touches you, you’re dead. If you stand too close for too long, you’re dead. If it spits on you, you’re dead. Honestly, if it just looks at you with enough intensity, I might have to start looking for a new assignment. I hear the 'Infinite Mana' builds are much more relaxing to guide."

The slime lunged. 

It wasn't a fast movement, but it was relentless. It gathered its mass, the green sludge rippling with a sound like a giant heart beating inside a bucket of mayonnaise, and threw itself forward in a wet, heavy flop. Artie scrambled backward, his heel catching on a gnarled root that looked like a charred circuit board. He flailed, his arms windmilling as he barely kept his balance, the rusted sword nearly slipping from his sweat-slicked palm.

The slime landed exactly where he had been standing a second ago, the ground sizzling slightly where the ooze touched the moss. A small cloud of digital ozone rose from the impact site.

"Missed!" Artie shouted, his voice an octave higher than usual.

"By about three inches," Fizz noted, checking her slate again. "Your heart rate is currently 140 BPM. If it hits 160, I think your 1 HP might just give up out of sheer stress. The System has a very low tolerance for 'Emotional Damage' when your Vitality is this low."

Artie didn't respond. He was too busy watching the slime re-orient itself. The creature didn't have a front or a back, just a shifting mass of hunger that was already turning toward him again. The Whispering Woods seemed to lean in, the shadows of the trees jittering a fraction of a second after the branches did, as if the world’s rendering engine was struggling to keep up with his precarious existence.

To his left, a thicket of thorns hummed with static electricity, the needles glowing with a faint, dangerous purple light. To his right, the ground fell away into a steep ravine filled with a thick, lavender fog that smelled of burnt copper. He was being hemmed in, the gnarled roots of a 'Patch-Note Oak' rising up behind him like a wall of jagged iron.

The slime wobbled again, its entire body pulsing with a sickly light. It was faster this time. It didn't just flop; it launched itself, a glob of green slime detaching from its main body like a projectile. 

Artie ducked, the glob whistling over his head with a sound like a wet whip. It slammed into the Patch-Note Oak behind him, the bark hissing and beginning to melt. The 'Whispering' of the tree turned into a distorted, high-pitched scream of ERROR: CORRUPT TEXTURE DATA before the sound cut out into static.

"It has a ranged attack?" Artie yelled, scrambling to his feet and nearly tripping over his own Linen Tunic, which felt as thin and useless as a hospital gown.

"It’s a slime, Artie. They’re 90% projectile," Fizz said. She was now hovering upside down, looking bored. "Honestly, the fact that you’re still alive is a statistical anomaly in itself. The System is probably already trying to figure out which sub-routine it needs to run to fix you. You’re like a divide-by-zero error in a pair of boots."

Artie backed away, his shoulders hitting the cold, metallic bark of the tree. The slime was moving with a strange, predatory intelligence now, its gelatinous body stretching out to cover more ground, cutting off his only clear path back toward the center of the clearing. 

[Warning: Enemy is charging a Heavy Attack!]
[Probability of Survival: 0.0001%]

The notification flashed in bright, neon yellow, obscuring his vision for a split second. 

"Shut up," Artie hissed at the air. 

The slime distended, its green body growing thin and taut like a rubber band being pulled to its breaking point. The two black eyes stared at Artie, reflecting his own terrified face. The air in the woods felt heavy, the whispers of the trees reaching a fever pitch as they anticipated the 'Deletion' event. 

Artie gripped the Broken Tutorial Sword with both hands now, though the System still registered it as being in his right. He needed to time this. One hit. That was all it would take. With his 100% Crit Rate, even a 1 Strength swing should be enough to vaporize a Level 1 mob, provided the math held up.

"Come on," Artie breathed, the world slowing down as the slime launched itself. 

It was a wall of green death, a solid mass of corrosive sludge flying through the air with the weight of a bowling ball. Artie had nowhere to go. He was cornered, the jagged roots pinning him in place, the smell of rot and acid filling his nostrils. The heat of the creature’s 'Passive Ooze' began to prickle against his skin, a warning that the 0.1 damage was only milliseconds away.

Artie swung. He didn't swing with strength—he didn't have any. He swung with the desperation of a man who had already died once and really didn't want to make a habit of it.

The broken blade cut through the air, trailing a faint, golden light—the signature of a guaranteed Critical Hit.

But the slime was already mid-air, its mass shifting, its trajectory aimed directly at Artie’s chest. The collision was inevitable, a mathematical certainty that Artie’s 1 HP was about to be tested against the full weight of a Level 1 tutorial boss.

"Artie!" Fizz shouted, her snark finally replaced by genuine alarm as the green mass obscured her view of her charge.

The sword connected with the outer membrane of the slime, the golden light flaring bright enough to drown out the neon green of the woods. But the momentum of the creature didn't stop, and Artie felt the first touch of the cold, acidic sludge against his Linen Tunic.

The rusted edge of the Broken Tutorial Sword sliced through the air exactly three inches above the Level 1 Slime’s translucent, wobbling crest. 

[Attack Missed!]
[Dexterity Check Failed: 1 vs 5]

The momentum of the swing, fueled by Artie’s pathetic Strength stat of 1, dragged him forward. He felt the cold, gelatinous mass of the creature brush against the hem of his Linen Tunic. It was a sensation like wet, vibrating rubber, and it was the most terrifying thing he had ever felt.

"Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me," Artie hissed, his boots skidding on the damp moss. 

The System’s rounding rule was a guillotine hanging over his neck. In this world, 0.1 damage didn't just hurt; it rounded up to 1. And since Artie only had 1 HP, a vigorous high-five from a friendly NPC would likely result in a funeral. The slime gurgled, a sound like a clogged drain, and lunged.

Artie pivoted, or at least he tried to. With 1 Agility, his body responded to his brain’s commands with the urgency of a dial-up modem. He swung again, a desperate backhand meant to keep the creature at bay.

[Attack Missed!]
[Dexterity Check Failed: 1 vs 3]

The sword whistled through the space the slime had occupied a microsecond before. The creature was a tutorial mob—the bottom of the food chain—yet to Artie, it moved like a blur of neon-green malice. He was fighting a living puddle, and the puddle was winning.

"Come on, you stupid pile of Jell-O!" 

He lunged forward for a third strike, putting all his weight behind a thrust. The tip of the rusted blade caught on a protruding root. Artie stumbled, his nose nearly grazing the slime’s acidic surface. He could smell it now: a sharp, chemical odor like industrial floor cleaner mixed with old lemon peels.

[Attack Missed!]
[Dexterity Check Failed: 1 vs 8]

Behind him, the Whispering Woods lived up to their name. A nearby Patch-Note Oak, its bark etched with shimmering lines of code, began to groan. The sound wasn't the rustle of leaves, but a synthesized, monotone voice that vibrated in Artie's teeth.

*“Patch 1.2.0: Reduced the aggro radius of Lesser Slimes by fifteen percent to accommodate players with sub-optimal motor skills,”* the tree recited. *“Fixed an issue where tutorial trees would occasionally scream during combat. Error. Error. Scream.exe not found.”*

"Shut up!" Artie roared, spinning around to deliver a horizontal slash. The slime flattened itself against the ground, the blade passing harmlessly through the air where its 'head' had been.

[Attack Missed!]
[Dexterity Check Failed: 1 vs 4]

Four misses. His heart was hammering against his ribs, a frantic rhythm that felt like it might do the 1 point of damage necessary to kill him from the inside. He was cornered. To his left, a cluster of thorny brambles; to his right, the screaming Oak; and in front of him, the slime, which was now vibrating with the intensity of a heavy attack.

The creature’s green core began to glow. This was the Heavy Attack the System had warned him about. If it landed, he wouldn't just be dead; he’d be dissolved into a puddle of Arthur-flavored soup.

"Fifth time's the charm," Artie grunted, swinging the Broken Tutorial Sword in a wide, panicked arc. 

[Attack Missed!]
[Dexterity Check Failed: 1 vs 12]

The sword struck the trunk of the Patch-Note Oak with a dull *thwack*. The tree didn't just take damage; it reacted.

*“Warning: Unauthorized modification of world geometry detected,”* the tree droned. *“Applying hotfix… Error. Error. Exception: NullPointerInMyFace.”*

The slime launched. It was a full-body leap, a sphere of corrosive slime flying through the air toward Artie’s chest. He had no time to dodge. His 1 Agility wouldn't allow it. He had no armor to speak of. He had 1 HP.

He did the only thing a man with 99 Luck and 100% Critical Hit rate could do. He closed his eyes and shoved the sword forward in a blind, pathetic jab.

The world didn't just make a sound; it broke.

[System Notification: Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit!]

The moment the rusted tip of the Broken Tutorial Sword made contact with the slime’s glowing core, the math of the universe folded in on itself. A guaranteed critical hit from a Statistical Anomaly wasn't just a "harder hit." It was a violation of the local reality.

A pillar of white-hot light erupted from the point of impact. The slime didn't die; it was deleted. Its mass was converted into pure kinetic energy that expanded outward in a perfect, devastating sphere. The shockwave hit Artie like a physical wall, but because he was the source of the crit, the System’s 'Friendly Fire' protocols—or perhaps just sheer confusion—kept him from vaporizing.

The Patch-Note Oak behind the slime didn't fare as well. The tree, which had been busy reciting notes about improved lighting effects, was caught in the blast. Its trunk shattered into millions of glowing pixels. 

*“Patch 1.3.1: Removed the ability for players to—OH GOD THE ERRORS—AAAAAAAGH!”* 

The tree’s synthesized scream cut off as it was leveled, its entire structure reduced to a stump that continued to leak flickering red error messages into the grass. The slime was gone. The tree was gone. A fifty-foot furrow had been carved into the earth, ending in a smoking crater where a peaceful tutorial path had once been.

Artie stood in the center of the destruction, his hand still gripping the hilt of the sword. The blade was no longer rusted; it was glowing with a faint, dying ember of the power it had just channeled.

Silence fell over the Whispering Woods, save for the distant, faint sound of other trees whispering about a bug fix for "sudden explosive deforestation."

A golden light washed over Artie, warmer and more pleasant than the crit-blast.

[Level Up!]
[Level 1 -> Level 2]

[Reward: 5 Stat Points allocated to 'Luck' (Automatic)]
[Reward: 1 Stat Point allocated to 'Dexterity' (Pity Bonus)]

Artie exhaled a breath he felt he’d been holding since he died in front of that vending machine. He blinked, and his new stat sheet flickered into view.

"A pity bonus?" Artie muttered, looking at the smoking crater where his first enemy had been. He looked at his hand, which was still shaking. "I just nuked a tree and a puddle because I’m bad at aiming. This... this is going to be a very weird game."

He looked down at his Linen Tunic. It was perfectly clean, despite the carnage. He still had his single copper coin. He was still Level 2 with 1 HP. But for the first time, he didn't feel like a victim of the System. He felt like its biggest mistake.

The smoke rising from the fifty-foot furrow smelled like ozone and burnt spreadsheets. Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stood at the epicenter of the devastation, his boots sinking into the translucent, gelatinous remains of the Level 1 Slime. Even though the creature’s HP bar had flickered into a flat gray zero, the physical contact invariant remained stubbornly active; the cooling slime-goo clung to his shins like a desperate, defeated ex.

Artie gripped the hilt of his Broken Tutorial Sword in his right hand, his knuckles white. His lungs burned, and his heart hammered a frantic rhythm against his ribs. He glanced at his peripheral vision, where the UI was struggling to keep up with the reality of a localized tactical nuke.

[HP: 1/1]
[MP: 1/1]
[Stamina: 88/100]
[Status: Level 2 - Statistical Anomaly]
[Location: The System Void (Error: Desync Detected)]

"That," Artie wheezed, wiping a streak of soot from his forehead with his free hand, "was significantly more explosive than the manual suggested."

Fizz hovered a few feet away. Her translucent wings buzzed with a high-pitched whine that suggested her internal processors were redlining. She wasn't looking at the smoking crater or the furrow that stretched toward the horizon; she was staring at the Data Slate gripped in her left hand, her eyes darting across lines of scrolling green text.

"Artie," she said, her voice dropping the practiced, airy guide-tone for something much sharper. "The System just had to rewrite three sub-routines to account for the fact that you deleted a protected environmental asset. You didn't just kill a slime; you murdered a Patch-Note Oak. Those things are literally made of the world's structural code. The System is still trying to figure out if we’re in the Whispering Woods or if you’ve punched us back into the character creation void."

"It was self-defense," Artie argued, though his voice lacked conviction as he looked at the smoldering stump of the tree. "The tree was in the way of my destiny. Or at least my swing. Besides, I leveled up. Doesn't the System like progression?"

"The System likes predictable variables, Artie. You are a rounding error with a sword."

As if on cue, a golden light coalesced in the air between them. It wasn't the majestic, shimmering glow of a legendary drop. It was a dull, sickly yellow, pulsating with the rhythmic thrum of a failing fluorescent bulb. It flickered, casting long, jagged shadows across the crater.

[System Notification]
[Achievement Unlocked: 'Well, You Tried!']
[Item Received: Participation Trophy]
[Rarity: Common (Cursed/Soul-bound)]
[Description: Awarded to the player who manages to cause a Tier 3 System Error before finishing the movement tutorial. You’re special, Arthur. Not 'hero' special. The other kind.]

A heavy, bronze-colored statue of a man tripping over his own shoelaces materialized out of the glitching light. It dropped straight into Artie’s left hand. It weighed at least ten pounds and felt unnervingly warm, as if it were still radiating the heat of the System’s annoyance.

"A trophy?" Artie managed a weak grin, despite the biting description. "See, Fizz? Recognition. I’m an achiever. First five minutes in the world and I’ve already got hardware."

Fizz didn't smile. She tapped her slate aggressively, her brow furrowing until her digital eyes were nearly shut. "Artie, put that down. Or better yet, delete it. Throw it into the furrow. Bury it."

"It says it's soul-bound," Artie said, testing the weight. The bronze surface was etched with tiny, screaming faces. "And hey, it’s my first piece of loot. I’m not just going to toss—"

"Artie, look at the hidden stats!" Fizz shouted, shoving her Data Slate toward his face. 

Artie squinted at the screen. Beneath the sarcastic description, a set of red text was blinking in a language that looked suspiciously like a warning label on a nuclear reactor.

[Hidden Stat: Aura of the Beacon]

Artie’s grin died a sudden, violent death. "Five hundred percent?"

"It’s a lighthouse," Fizz whispered, her professional mask finally cracking into genuine concern. "Artie, you’re a one-health glass cannon in a tutorial zone that you just nuked. You are currently the loudest thing in the System’s ears, and you just invited every monster in the Whispering Woods to come and see why."

A low, guttural growl echoed from the shadows of the unburnt trees. Then another. And another. The woods, which had been reciting peaceful patch notes about 'Improved Foliage Collision' moments ago, suddenly went silent. Then, the screaming started. Not from people, but from the code itself.

Artie looked at his UI. 

[Super-Mega-Ultra-Crit: Cooldown (23:58:12)]

"Right," Artie said, his voice an octave higher than usual. "And my big 'Delete' button is currently on lunch break for the next twenty-four hours."

"Artie," Fizz said, her wings picking up speed until she was a blur of light. "Look at the mini-map."

He glanced at the corner of his vision. Usually, the map was a sea of peaceful green dots representing neutral mobs and the occasional yellow dot for a slime. Now, it looked like a bowl of strawberry jam. Dozens of red dots were converging on their location from every direction, moving with a speed that suggested they weren't just curious—they were offended.

A bush twenty yards away exploded as a Tutorial Wolf—normally a passive creature that only attacked if a player actively kicked it—leaped out. Its eyes were glowing with a frantic, unnatural red light. It wasn't looking at Artie’s throat; it was staring directly at the bronze trophy in his left hand with a look of pure, unadulterated hatred.

[Tutorial Wolf - Lvl 4 (Aggroed)]
[HP: 120/120]

"Fizz, if I crit it, can I kill it?" Artie asked, shifting his grip on the Broken Tutorial Sword.

"Yes," she snapped, "but there are forty more behind it! You have one hit point! If a single hair on its chin touches you, you're a ghost! You don't have the Dexterity to kite a pack, Artie! Run!"

The wolf snarled and lunged. Artie didn't think. He didn't calculate. He just pivoted on his heel and did the only thing a man with 1 HP and a 500% aggro multiplier could do.

He ran.

"Where are we going?" Artie yelled over his shoulder as he scrambled over the lip of the furrow, the bronze trophy clanking against his side. The weight was awkward, throwing off his balance.

"Away!" Fizz screamed, flying alongside his head. "North! Toward the edge of the zone! If we can reach the transition line, we might be able to break their line of sight, but with that trophy, you’re basically a neon sign in a dark room!"

Artie pushed his legs as hard as they would go. His Agility was bottom-tier, and every step felt like he was running through waist-deep molasses. Behind him, the sound of snapping branches and howling grew louder. It wasn't just wolves anymore. He could hear the wet, rhythmic slapping of slimes—dozens of them—merging into a larger, angrier mass.

[System Notification]
[Environmental Alert: Tutorial Zone Stability at 84%.]
[Reason: Excessive Aggro density in Sector 4.]

"The System is mad at me!" Artie shouted, ducking under a low-hanging branch that scraped his shoulder.

"The System is trying to balance the equation, Artie! And you're the variable that needs to be subtracted!"

A projectile whizzed past Artie’s ear—a glob of corrosive slime. Because of the 'Magnetic Failure' stat on the trophy, the glob actually curved mid-air, trying to hook back toward his head. He dove into a roll, the grass staining his Linen Tunic, and felt the heat of the mucus as it hissed into the dirt where his skull had been a second ago.

[Stamina: 42/100]

Artie scrambled back to his feet, clutching the heavy trophy to his chest like a cursed football. The woods were closing in. Every shadow held a pair of red eyes. The Whispering Woods were no longer whispering; they were screaming in a cacophony of distorted audio files and monster roars.

"I can't keep this up!" Artie panted, his vision blurring at the edges. "I need... a plan... or a shield... or a very large hole!"

"Keep running!" Fizz urged, her Data Slate emitting a frantic red pulse. "There’s a ravine up ahead! If we can get across, we can funnel them!"

"And if I trip?"

"Then I'll make sure your obituary mentions the trophy!"

Artie didn't have the breath to argue. He just ran, the heavy bronze weight in his left hand a constant reminder that in this world, even his rewards were actively trying to kill him.

## The Safe Zone?

Artie’s lungs felt like they had been scrubbed with industrial-grade sandpaper and then set on fire. Every breath was a jagged reminder that a Dexterity score of two—even with the "Pity Bonus" he’d clawed out of the System’s cold, dead hands—was not built for a cross-country sprint. He scrambled over a moss-covered log, his right hand white-knuckling the Broken Tutorial Sword while his left hand remained fused to the glowing, golden weight of the Participation Trophy.

[Stamina: 9/100]
[Status: Winded (Recovery Rate -50%)]

"Faster, Artie! It’s gaining! And by 'it,' I mean the entire local ecosystem!" Fizz hovered alongside him, her wings a blur of cyan pixels. She wasn't running, of course. She was a guide. She just floated there, looking professionally concerned while Artie did all the dying.

Behind them, the Level 4 Tutorial Wolf let out a howl that sounded less like a predator and more like a dial-up modem screaming at a wall. It wasn't just the wolf. Thanks to the gold-plated monstrosity fused to Artie's left hand, he had a trail of angry slimes, two disgruntled squirrels, and a very confused-looking badger following him like he was the messiah of the misunderstood. The physical contact with the trailing edge of a Level 1 Slime—a sticky, acidic sensation against his heel—finally snapped as he put on a desperate burst of speed.

The Participation Trophy hummed. It didn't just vibrate; it sang with the frequency of a thousand "You Tried" stickers. 

[Participation Trophy (Cursed/Soul-bound)]
[Effect: Aura of the Beacon (+500% Aggro)]
[Effect: Magnetic Failure (Projectile Attraction)]

"I hate this thing," Artie wheezed, his boots skidding on the gravel as the treeline finally broke. "I hate the System. I hate math."

"Math loves you, Artie! It just has a very aggressive way of showing it!" Fizz pointed ahead. "Look! The Oakhaven Safe Zone! If we cross the threshold, the aggro-leash should snap!"

The gates of Oakhaven weren't just wood and iron. They were a sprawling monument to the System’s obsession with order. Massive white stone pillars rose from the earth, inscribed with glowing blue runes that pulsed in time with the world’s heartbeat. Above the archway, a massive floating UI display read: [WELCOME TO OAKHAVEN - POPULATION: 1,242 (98.4% STABLE)].

Artie didn't care about the stability. He cared about the invisible line in the dirt. He threw himself forward, the wolf lunging behind him, its jaws snapping inches from his Linen Tunic. If those teeth touched him, he was gone. One hit point. One. He was a soap bubble in a world made of needles.

He crossed the line.

*BZZZT.*

The wolf hit an invisible wall of shimmering blue force and bounced backward, its snarl turning into a series of glitched whimpers. The slimes and the badger followed suit, piling up against the barrier like a crowd at a sold-out concert.

[Entering: Oakhaven (Safe Zone)]
[Aggro Cleared. Welcome, Traveler.]

Artie collapsed onto the cobbles, the Participation Trophy clattering against the stones. It didn't fall out of his hand, of course. It was soul-bound. It just sat there, glowing with a smug, golden light, attracting the curious stares of a few nearby NPCs.

"We... we made it," Artie gasped, watching his stamina bar begin its agonizingly slow crawl back toward double digits.

"Don't get too comfortable," Fizz said, landing on his shoulder. "We still have to pass the Gate Scanner. And usually, the System likes its travelers to have, you know, more than one hit point and a luck stat that doesn't look like a typo."

Artie looked up. Suspended from the center of the gate’s arch was a massive, crystalline eye. It wasn't a biological eye; it was a multifaceted diamond that rotated with a series of mechanical clicks. As he stood up, the eye swiveled toward him. A beam of pale green light shot out, sweeping from his boots to his head.

[Initiating Standard Entry Scan...]
[Analyzing Player Data: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon...]
[Level: 2]
[Class: N/A (Unassigned)]

The green light hit the Participation Trophy. The beam immediately flickered, turning a sickly shade of yellow. 

"Oh, here we go," Fizz muttered, her Data Slate beginning to spark.

[Warning: High-Level Aggro-Beacon Detected.]
[Analyzing Item: Participation Trophy...]
[Result: Cursed. Soul-bound. Tier 3 System Error Source.]

The scanner’s mechanical clicking accelerated. The green light turned a violent, pulsing red. The floating UI display above the gate began to scroll through text at a speed that made Artie's head spin.

[Error: Statistical Inconsistency Detected.]

[HP: 1/1]

[Crit Rate: 100%]
[Result: FATAL ERROR.]

"Fizz, what’s it doing?" Artie asked, backing away as the crystalline eye began to smoke.

"It's trying to find a category for you!" she shouted over the rising whine of the scanner. "The System hates anomalies, Artie! It wants everyone in a neat little box! A 'Warrior' box or a 'Mage' box! You’re a 'One-Hit-Point-Walking-Nuclear-Option' box!"

Two guards in polished silver plate armor stepped forward, their hands on the pommels of their swords. Above their heads, their tags read [Oakhaven Gate Guard - Lvl 25]. They looked bored, but as the scanner began to wail, that boredom shifted into visible confusion.

"Identify yourself, traveler!" the lead guard shouted. "And put that... whatever that golden thing is... away!"

"I can't!" Artie yelled back, holding up his left hand. "It's stuck! It's a reward! Sort of!"

The scanner reached a crescendo. A bolt of red energy shot from the eye, striking the ground in front of Artie and forming a massive, shimmering holographic window that everyone in the vicinity could see.

[CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE: DATA OVERFLOW]
[Subject: CHAR_ARTIE]
[Logic Loop: 100% Crit + 1 HP = Does Not Compute.]
[Applying Emergency Classification...]

The red light suddenly vanished, replaced by a dull, persistent purple glow that settled over Artie like a heavy blanket. He felt a weight on his chest, not physical, but digital. A new icon appeared next to his name in his peripheral vision.

[New Title Assigned: Statistical Anomaly]
[Description: You are a glitch in the grand design. A rounding error with a pulse. The System cannot account for your existence, so it has simply decided to label you 'Problematic.']

[Entry Permitted (Under Protest).]

The guards looked at the purple tag hovering over Artie's head. They looked at each other. The lead guard sighed and stepped aside.

"An Anomaly, huh?" he muttered, shaking his head. "Great. Another one of those. Just don't go critting the fountain, kid. The Mayor hates cleaning up the logic-leaks."

The gates groaned open, revealing the bustling streets of Oakhaven. 

"See?" Fizz said, her wings fluttering with relief. "Entry granted. And you only broke one automated security system to do it. That’s a new personal record."

Artie looked at the purple 'Statistical Anomaly' tag reflecting in a nearby puddle. It pulsed with a steady, rhythmic light, marking him as something different, something broken.

"I have a feeling," Artie said, stepping into the city, "that 'under protest' is going to be the theme of my life here."

The Mayor’s office in Oakhaven didn't just smell like power; it smelled like high-resolution rendering and expensive, micro-transactional wax. The walls were lined with shelves of leather-bound ledgers that Artie suspected were actually just physical manifestations of the town’s database. Behind a desk carved from a single, massive block of Obsidian-Oak—a material that looked like it had a very high damage threshold—sat the Mayor.

Artie stood on the plush, crimson carpet, feeling every bit the level-one glitch he was. His right hand was white-knuckled around the hilt of the Broken Tutorial Sword. It was a pathetic weapon, little more than a jagged shard of iron, but it was the only thing between him and the terrifyingly polished reality of this room. In his left hand, the Participation Trophy pulsed with a rhythmic, sickly neon light. The "Aura of the Beacon" was currently making the shadows in the corners of the room vibrate with a low-frequency hum that Artie was pretty sure was the sound of every monster in a five-mile radius checking their GPS.

The Mayor of Oakhaven was a man whose character model was clearly set to 'Opulent.' He wore a silver chain of office that shimmered with a constant stream of scrolling data: [Level 42], [Social Standing: Exalted], [Current Mood: Opportunistic]. He didn't look at Artie; he looked at the space six inches above Artie’s head where his name and title floated.

"Statistical Anomaly," the Mayor whispered, the words sounding like a cash register opening. "The gate scanner hasn't thrown a Fatal Error like that since the Great Patch of '04. Do you have any idea what you are, Mr. Penhaligon?"

"A guy who really needs a chair and maybe a sandwich?" Artie suggested.

[Stamina: 12/100]
[Status: Winded (Recovery Rate -50%)]

The hunger bar in the corner of his vision was flickering a threatening shade of orange, a pixelated stomach growling for sustenance. He kept his posture straight, despite the fact that his legs felt like they were made of overcooked noodles. In a world where a stiff breeze could deplete his entire 1 HP health pool, looking like a "glass cannon" was a tactical necessity. Looking like "shattered glass" was an invitation for the Mayor to sweep him into a dustpan.

"You are a walking mint," the Mayor said, standing up. He rounded the desk, his eyes locked on Artie’s character sheet—or at least the parts the System hadn't redacted with "Error 404" messages. "A 100% Critical Hit rate. Do you understand the economic implications? Most artisans spend decades trying to reach a five-percent 'Masterwork' proc rate. You? You could tap a piece of raw iron and it would come out a Vorpal Blade just because the System doesn't know how to roll a 'normal' result for you."

Artie tightened his grip on the Broken Tutorial Sword. "I'm more of a 'vaporize the tutorial wolf' kind of guy. I don't do much blacksmithing. Mostly because I don't have a hammer. Or a forge. Or any health."

"You will," the Mayor countered, a predatory smile stretching his cheeks. "Oakhaven is a hub of commerce, and commerce requires stability. Your presence is... unstable. Therefore, the municipal code requires a 'Variance Tax' for all anomalies of Tier 3 or higher. It’s for the safety of the server, you understand."

[System Notification: New Quest Offered - The Mayor’s Cut]
[Objective: Pay 500 Gold in 'Variance Taxes' or provide 10 pieces of 'Crit-Forged' equipment.]
[Reward: Citizenship, 500 XP, 1x 'Safe Zone' voucher.]
[Failure: Immediate deportation to the 'Unpatched Wilds'.]

"Five hundred gold?" Artie barked, the Participation Trophy nearly slipping from his left hand. "I have exactly one copper coin and a trophy that makes me a magnet for everything with teeth. I'm not a bank, I'm a target."

The Mayor leaned in, his Level 42 aura pressing against Artie like a physical weight. It was a passive intimidation check, and Artie could feel his 1 HP vibrating in protest. The Mayor’s left hand rested on his Town Seal, a heavy golden stamp that looked like it could deal at least 10-15 blunt damage—more than enough to delete Artie ten times over.

"Then you'd better start swinging that broken toothpick of yours at something valuable," the Mayor said. "Or perhaps, I could 'invest' in your potential. A small contract. You provide Oakhaven with a guaranteed 'Crit-Output' for our local guild, and I overlook the fact that your HP is..." He paused, squinting at the blurred red bar above Artie's head. "Well, it’s remarkably low, isn't it? One might almost say it's a rounding error. A single point?"

Artie’s heart hammered against his ribs. This was the moment. If the Mayor realized that Artie was a literal one-hit-point wonder, the negotiation was over. The Mayor wouldn't tax him; he’d harvest him like a rare crafting node.

"It's a specialized build," Artie lied, his voice dropping into a low, confident register. He channeled every tech support agent he’d ever argued with. "The System balances the 100% Crit by compressing my health into a 'Perfect Guard' state. I don't need HP if I never get hit. It’s a high-level optimization. And trust me, you don't want to see what happens when the 'Reflect' damage procs on a 100% Crit build. The last thing that touched me turned into a pile of unformatted metadata."

It was total nonsense—a bluff built on the shaky foundation of the System's own bad math. But the Mayor hesitated. In this world, the weirdest builds were often the most dangerous, and "Perfect Guard" sounded like the kind of broken mechanic a developer would forget to patch.

"A bold claim," the Mayor muttered, stepping back and removing his hand from the Town Seal. "But a Statistical Anomaly is, by definition, an unknown variable. I’ll give you twenty-four hours to find a way to pay that tax, Penhaligon. Until then, you are a guest of Oakhaven. But remember: in this town, we don't worship the gods. We worship the roll. And right now? Your rolls are the only thing keeping you from being recycled into raw data."

Artie turned to leave, the Participation Trophy’s neon glow illuminating the Mayor’s greedy expression. As the heavy oak doors clicked shut behind him, Artie let out a breath he didn't know he was holding. He was still holding the Broken Tutorial Sword in his right hand, his knuckles finally beginning to regain their color.

He was in. He was safe—for now. But the end condition of his stay was clear. He wasn't just a player anymore; he was a walking jackpot. And in a town full of gamblers, someone was eventually going to try and pull the lever.

"Fizz," Artie whispered to the empty air, "we need to find a way to turn 'breaking the game' into 'paying the rent' before that guy decides to check my 'Perfect Guard' with a crossbow."

The heavy oak doors of the Mayor’s office clicked shut behind Artie, the sound echoing through the marble-floored hallway like a judge’s gavel. He stood there for a moment, his fingers cramping around the handle of the Participation Trophy in his left hand. It was cold, heavy, and currently pulsing with a faint, rhythmic light that seemed to scream for attention.

[Quest Updated: The Mayor’s Cut]
[Objective: Pay 500 Gold or provide 10 Crit-Forged items.]
[Time Remaining: 23:58:12]
[Penalty for Failure: Deportation to the Unpatched Wilds (Instant Death for 1 HP builds).]

"Great," Artie whispered, his voice sounding thin in the grand corridor. He had been in this world for less than three hours and was already being shaken down by the local government. It felt uncomfortably like his internship at the accounting firm, only with a significantly higher probability of being eaten by a wolf.

He started down the hallway, his Broken Tutorial Sword still gripped tightly in his right hand. He was acutely aware of how he must look—a man in a simple linen tunic carrying a rusted piece of scrap metal and a glowing trophy that smelled vaguely of ozone and disappointment. He needed a plan, he needed gold, and most importantly, he needed to avoid being breathed on by anything with an offensive stat higher than zero.

Artie didn't even make it to the grand staircase before the air in the hallway changed. It grew heavy, smelling of expensive incense and polished steel. 

Leaning against a white marble pillar was a man who looked like he had been designed by a committee of people who thought 'protagonist' was a personality trait. He was tall, draped in a Silk Cloak that likely cost more than Artie's entire life insurance policy back home, and he possessed a jawline sharp enough to chip ice. Above his head, the System labels flickered in a golden hue that made Artie’s eyes ache.

[Vane - Lvl 28] [Class: Sun-Blessed Paladin] [Affiliation: Order of the Golden Ratio]

Twenty-eight. The number sat like a lead weight in Artie’s stomach. He was Level 2. He was a 'Statistical Anomaly' with 1 HP. Vane was a literal god-king in comparison. 

Vane didn't move as Artie approached, but his eyes followed him with predatory focus. They weren't looking at Artie’s face; they were locked onto the flickering neon text that hovered above his head, the one the gate scanners had so graciously gifted him.

[Title: Statistical Anomaly]

"So," Vane said, his voice a smooth baritone. "You’re the glitch the Mayor is so worried about. The 'walking mint' with the broken numbers."

Artie stopped five paces back, maintaining a careful distance. "I prefer the term 'optimization specialist,' but 'glitch' works if you’re into brevity. And you are?"

"Vane," the man said, pushing off the pillar. He moved with a fluid grace that suggested high Dexterity. "I lead the local contingent of the Order. We maintain the balance of the System. And usually, when something is as... unbalanced... as you appear to be, it’s my job to see if it needs a patch."

Artie felt a cold sweat break out on his neck. His 1 HP bar was invisible to Vane—he hoped—but the [Statistical Anomaly] tag was a massive neon sign inviting scrutiny.

"I’m already under a Variance Tax, Vane," Artie said, forcing his voice to remain steady. "The Mayor’s already got his hand in my pockets. If you’re looking for a bribe, you’re about 500 gold too late."

Vane smiled, though the expression didn't reach his eyes. He reached down to the hilt of the weapon at his hip. It was a Masterwork Rapier, the handguard shaped like a sunburst, the steel so bright it seemed to hold its own light.

"I don't care for gold," Vane said. "I care for data. The gate scanners reported a 100% Critical Hit rate. Statistically impossible. Even the most dedicated Luck-builds cap out at forty percent before the diminishing returns kick in. You’re a walking impossibility, Arthur."

"Artie," he corrected. "And it’s not impossible if the math allows it. It’s just... unlikely."

"Is it?" Vane took a step forward, and the hallway suddenly felt much smaller. "I want to see it. A friendly spar. Just to see how the 'Anomaly' handles a real blade. I’ll even set my damage output to 'Training' mode."

[System Notification: Vane has initiated a Duel Request (Friendly).]
[Rules: First to 10% HP or First Yield.]
[Warning: Even in 'Training' mode, minimum damage is 1 HP.]

Artie’s heart did a frantic tap-dance against his ribs. Minimum damage was 1 HP. If Vane so much as grazed his sleeve, it was game over. The 'Friendly' duel would be the shortest, most lethal encounter in the history of Oakhaven.

"I don’t spar for free," Artie said, forcing a smirk. He shifted his weight, making sure the Participation Trophy was visible in his left hand. "And honestly? You’re not geared for it."

Vane paused, his hand tightening on the rapier’s hilt. "Excuse me?"

"You’re a Paladin. High defense, high sustain, moderate burst," Artie said, leaning into the bluff he had established with the Mayor. "But you’re looking at my HP and thinking I’m a glass cannon. You think you can just tap me and the duel is over."

"You have 1 Health, Anomaly," Vane said, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "I can see the bar. It’s a single red pixel."

"Exactly," Artie said, stepping closer. He was within Vane's reach now. If the Paladin drew that rapier, Artie was dead before he could blink. "Do you really think someone would walk into a Level 28 zone with 1 HP if they didn't have a way to make sure that 1 HP never moves? Have you ever heard of the 'Perfect Guard' build, Vane? Or are you too busy polishing your cape to read the high-level theory-crafting forums?"

Vane’s eyes narrowed. The rapier stayed in its sheath, but only just. "Perfect Guard is a myth. A theoretical build that requires frame-perfect timing and a 100% reflection rate. No one can maintain that."

"No one normal," Artie said, tapping the [Statistical Anomaly] tag above his head. "But I’m the guy who broke the gate scanner. I don't dodge, Vane. I don't need to. Every hit you land on me while my guard is up doesn't just do zero damage—it reflects 200% of the force back at the attacker. That’s why my HP is 1. It’s a bait. A lure for people like you who think a small number means a weak player."

He could see the gears turning in Vane's head. In a world governed by stats, a 1 HP build was either a joke or a terrifying exploit. And since Artie was covered in 'Anomaly' flags and carrying a soul-bound trophy that was currently vibrating with energy, Vane was leaning toward the latter.

"A reflection build," Vane muttered. He looked at Artie's Broken Tutorial Sword. "And the 100% Crit rate?"

"If I reflect your attack, the counter-hit is a guaranteed Critical," Artie lied. "It’s a closed loop of mathematical inevitability. You swing, you die. I stay at 1 HP. It’s very efficient. Saves a fortune on health potions."

Vane drew his Masterwork Rapier. The sound of steel on leather was like a whistle. He didn't lunge, but he held the point inches from Artie's chest. Artie didn't move. He couldn't. His legs were effectively made of jelly, but he forced his eyes to stay locked on Vane's.

"One touch," Vane said. "If your 'Perfect Guard' is real, I’ll feel the kickback. If it’s not... well, the System will have one less bug to worry about."

"Go ahead," Artie said, his voice steady despite the internal screaming. "But fair warning: Oakhaven’s insurance doesn't cover 'Suicide by Math.' If you break your fancy sword on my chest, don't come crying to me for the repair bill."

Vane hesitated. The rapier’s tip quivered. He was looking for a tell—a flinch, a shift in posture, anything that betrayed terror. But Artie was so terrified he had reached a state of catatonic stillness that apparently looked like supreme confidence.

[Status: Bluffed_Perfect_Guard is highly effective!]
[Vane is reconsidering his tactical approach.]

"You’re either the most dangerous man in this town," Vane said, slowly lowering the blade, "or the luckiest liar I’ve ever met."

"In this world, is there a difference?" Artie asked.

He didn't wait for a response. Artie turned his back on the Paladin—a move that was either the ultimate power play or the stupidest thing he had ever done—and started walking toward the stairs. Every step felt like he was walking on a tightrope over a pit of spikes. He expected to feel a rapier through his spine at any second.

"This isn't over, Anomaly!" Vane called out behind him. The sound of the rapier returning to its sheath followed. "The Variance Tax isn't the only thing you have to worry about. The Order will be watching. If you’re a virus, we’ll find the cure."

"Good luck with that," Artie muttered under his breath, finally reaching the stairs and rounding the corner. "I’ve been trying to find the cure for my own life for years."

He didn't stop moving until he was out of the building and half a block away, tucked into the shadows of a merchant’s stall. He leaned against the cold stone wall, his breath coming in ragged gasps.

[Stamina: 14/100]
[Hunger: 10/100 (Flickering Orange)]

"Fizz?" Artie whispered.

A small, pixelated sprite popped into existence near his ear, her wings buzzing with nervous energy. "Artie! That was... wow. I actually thought I was going to have to find a new protagonist. Do you have any idea how hard it is to fill out the 'Death by Paladin' paperwork?"

"I almost died, Fizz. He had a Level 28 rapier. I could feel the heat coming off it."

"But you didn't!" Fizz chirped, doing a loop-de-loop. "You successfully bluffed a Sun-Blessed Paladin! Do you know what that does for your hidden 'Charisma-Exploit' modifier? Nothing, because I just made that up, but it was still impressive!"

Artie looked down at his hands. They were shaking. He still had 1 HP. He still had a 500-gold tax due in twenty-four hours. And now, he had a high-level fanatic convinced he was a walking WMD of reflection damage.

"I need gear," Artie said, pushing off the wall. "Real gear. Something that actually gives me Evasion. If Vane sees me trip over a rug and die, the bluff is over."

"Well," Fizz said, pointing her tiny wand toward the town gates. "The Mayor mentioned the Low-Level Crypts. Lots of skeletons, very predictable patterns, and most importantly? High drop rates for 'Coward’s Gear.' It’s perfect for you!"

"Coward’s gear," Artie sighed. "Fine. Lead the way. But if I see Vane again, I’m hiding in a barrel."

"A barrel? How classic! I’ll mark it on your map as a 'Tactical Stealth Container'."

Artie started walking, the Participation Trophy glowing in his hand, a beacon for every monster and rival in Oakhaven. He was a Statistical Anomaly, a 1 HP glitch in a world of giants, and somehow, he had to find a way to make the math work in his favor before the System decided to delete him for good.
