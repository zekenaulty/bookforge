# Chapter 1: Welcome to the RNG-Hellscape

## The Exit Interview

The fluorescent light in the breakroom hummed with the frequency of a migraine that had finally achieved sentience. It flickered, a rhythmic strobe that turned the beige walls and the crusty microwave into a low-budget horror set. Arthur Penhaligon—Artie to the three people who didn't call him 'Hey, You'—stared at the Snack-O-Matic 3000 with the intensity of a man contemplating regicide.

Behind the scratched plexiglass, a single bag of 'Nacho Average Jalapeño' chips dangled by a literal plastic hair. The metal coil had completed its rotation, but the bag had defied the laws of gravity, physics, and basic human decency. It hung there, mocking him, a buck-fifty investment suspended in a bureaucratic limbo that mirrored Artie’s entire existence.

"Are you kidding me?" Artie muttered. His voice was raspy from eight hours of explaining to Mrs. Gable why her internet didn't work when she unplugged the router to vacuum. "It’s a bag of chips. It’s air and corn dust. Just fall."

He shifted his weight, and the weight of his cargo shifted with him. In his right hand, Artie gripped the hilt of a 'Rusty Shortsword.' It wasn't actually metal, or at least not the kind that could hold an edge. It was high-density foam coated in a realistic, weathered latex, a prop for the 'Kingdoms of Kaladar' LARP event he was supposed to be driving to the moment his shift ended. His manager, a man whose personality was best described as 'lukewarm mayonnaise,' had already given him a thirty-minute lecture about 'professionalism in the workspace' when he’d seen the sword leaning against Artie's cubicle. 

Artie hadn't cared. He didn't care about the spreadsheets, the 'synergy' meetings, or the way the office coffee tasted like a blend of charcoal and despair. He only cared about getting to the woods, putting on his tabard, and pretending, for forty-eight hours, that he wasn't a cog in a machine that was desperately in need of oil.

But now, the machine was winning.

"E-4," Artie whispered, his finger hovering over the keypad. "I paid for E-4."

He looked down at his right hand. The foam sword felt absurd in the sterile light of the breakroom, but it was the only thing he owned that felt real. His smartphone was a dead brick in his pocket, its battery drained by a day of scrolling through forums to avoid looking at his inbox. His wallet was equally light, containing exactly three dollars—half of which was currently tied up in the Jalapeño hostage situation.

He reached out with his left hand and gave the vending machine a tentative shove. The Snack-O-Matic 3000 didn't budge. It was a heavy, industrial beast, bolted to the floor as if the company feared someone might actually try to steal the stale granola bars.

"Come on, you bucket of bolts. Work with me."

Artie leaned his shoulder into the machine, his right hand still white-knuckled around the LARP sword. He could see his reflection in the plexiglass: a man in his late twenties with dark circles under his eyes and a haircut that screamed 'I gave up in 2019.' He looked like a background character in a movie about a guy who has a much more interesting life.

He gave the machine a harder shake. This time, the coil rattled. The bag of chips swayed. For a glorious second, it looked like it might drop. Then, it settled back into its precarious perch, more stuck than before.

"That’s it," Artie snapped. The last thread of his patience, frayed by a thousand 'per my last email's, finally snapped. "I am not losing a dollar-fifty to a machine that hasn't been cleaned since the Clinton administration."

He dropped into a crouch, peering into the delivery bin at the bottom. The flap was heavy plastic, spring-loaded to prevent 'theft.' Artie knew the legend: if you reached up far enough, you could sometimes jar the coils. It was a move born of desperation and hunger, a low-level exploit in the game of office survival.

He shoved his left arm into the bin, the plastic teeth of the flap biting into his forearm. He reached upward, his fingers straining toward the dangling chips. 

"Just... one... nudge..."

His right hand, the one holding the Rusty Shortsword, braced against the side of the machine for leverage. He didn't notice the frayed power cord snaking out from the back of the Snack-O-Matic, where the insulation had been rubbed raw by years of being shoved against the wall. He didn't see the small pool of water from the leaking industrial fridge nearby that had crept toward the machine's base.

As Artie lunged upward, trying to hook the bag with his fingernails, his sword—specifically the metallic-painted crossguard which, unknown to Artie, contained a very real, very conductive steel core for structural integrity—slid into a gap in the machine’s metal casing.

The world didn't end with a bang. It ended with a *hum*.

A massive, bone-shaking vibration surged up Artie’s right arm. It wasn't just a shock; it was a hostile takeover. His muscles clamped shut, his hand fusing to the hilt of the sword, which was now acting as a perfect bridge between the building's faulty wiring and his own nervous system. 

Blue sparks danced across the plexiglass, illuminating the 'Nacho Average Jalapeño' chips in a ghostly, electric glow. Artie tried to scream, but his jaw was locked in a grimace of pure, unadulterated agony. His vision began to pixelate. Not in the metaphorical sense—literal squares of color began to drop out of his field of vision, replaced by a flat, void-like black.

*Seriously?* he thought, the last coherent spark of his mind flickering with typical snark. *Killed by a vending machine? This is the most Artie way to go.*

The smell of ozone and burning polyester filled the air. The humming grew louder, reaching a crescendo that sounded suspiciously like a dial-up modem trying to connect to the afterlife. 

Then, the chips fell. 

The bag hit the bottom of the bin with a soft *thud* that Artie didn't hear.

The world went dark. The hum faded into a profound, ringing silence.

Artie felt... nothing. No pain, no floor beneath his feet, no weight of the sword in his hand. He was suspended in a place that wasn't a place, a vast expanse of nothingness that felt strangely like a computer screen before the BIOS loads.

A single line of text appeared in the center of the void. It was neon green and pulsed with a steady, digital heartbeat.

[Initializing... System Version 4.02.b]

"Oh, you've got to be kidding me," Artie said. Or thought. He wasn't sure if he had a mouth anymore. "I’m in a LitRPG? I died for a bag of chips and now I’m a protagonist?"

[Scanning Bio-Data... Error: Life Signs Not Found.]
[Scanning Soul-Data... Success.]
[Welcome, User: Arthur Penhaligon.]

Another line of text appeared, this one a bright, aggressive red.

[Warning: Your previous existence has been terminated due to: 'Stupidity-Induced Electrical Discharge.']

"Hey! It was a dollar-fifty!" Artie shouted into the dark. 

[Calculating Compensation for 'Ironic Death'...]
[Analyzing Inventory...]
[Detected: 1x Rusty Shortsword (Prop)]
[Detected: 1x Dead Smartphone]
[Detected: 1x Empty Wallet]

[System Note: Wow. You really had nothing going for you, did you?]

The text began to scroll faster now, a blur of stats and calculations that Artie couldn't keep up with. He felt a strange tugging sensation, as if his very essence was being compressed into a zip file.

[Character Creation Protocol Initiated.]
[Please wait while we determine your starting stats based on your final moments of 'High-Stakes Combat' with the Snack-O-Matic 3000.]

"High-stakes combat?" Artie muttered. "I was just hungry."

[Stat Allocation in Progress...]

The darkness began to thin, replaced by a blinding white light that smelled of fresh plastic and new-car scent. Artie felt the familiar weight of the sword return to his hand, but it felt different now. Heavier. Real.

The System’s voice—if a text box could have a voice—sounded distinctly smug.

[Welcome to the RNG-Hellscape, Artie. Let's see if you can survive the tutorial.]

The System Void didn’t look like the majestic, star-dusted expanse the movies promised. It looked like the inside of a broken monitor—a flickering, neon-blue purgatory that smelled faintly of ozone and regret. Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon drifted in the center of it, still clutching the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) in his right hand. The plastic hilt felt absurdly real for something that had just helped conduct enough electricity to fry his nervous system into a blackened crisp.

"Welcome, User 4,029,381," a voice echoed, sounding like a text-to-speech program with a severe attitude problem. "Cause of Death: Terminal Embarrassment by Snack-O-Matic 3000. Congratulations. You are the first person this century to be killed by a bag of 'Nacho Average Jalapeño' chips."

"It was a faulty wire," Artie snapped, his voice echoing in the emptiness. He tried to cross his arms, but floating in zero-G made the gesture look more like a clumsy interpretive dance. "And for the record, the chips fell. I won that encounter. It was a trade-kill at worst."

"You died for a snack that is forty percent sawdust by volume," the voice replied. Suddenly, a spark of golden light erupted a few feet from his nose. It swirled, compressed, and popped into the shape of a small, translucent woman with shimmering wings and a clipboard that looked suspiciously like an iPad.

"Who are you? The ghost of customer service?" Artie asked, squinting at the glowing figure.

The creature sighed, a sound like static on a radio. "I’m Fizz. I’m your legally mandated System Guide. My job is to make sure you don't immediately walk into a spike pit the second you spawn. Though, looking at your current equipment..." She gestured with a tiny, glowing hand at the LARP sword. "A 'Rusty Shortsword (Prop)'? Really? You're bringing a toy to a death-match? I’ve seen people spawn with kitchen spatulas that had more lethality."

"It has sentimental value," Artie lied, tightening his grip on the hilt. "And a conductive core, apparently. Where am I? Is this the part where I get reincarnated as a slime or a vending machine? Because if I’m a vending machine, I’m overcharging for the jalapeño chips. Pure spite."

"Don't give the System ideas," Fizz muttered, tapping her clipboard with a translucent stylus. A massive, blue screen shimmered into existence between them. "This is Character Creation. Usually, we do the whole 'sculpting your cheekbones' thing, but since you died with a 'Stupidity-Induced Electrical Discharge,' the System has flagged you for an accelerated start. You’ve got 100 Stat Points. Spend them, or I’m spending them for you on 'Agility' so I don't have to watch you move this slowly for the next three levels."

Artie squinted at the screen. The text flickered, lines of code occasionally bleeding into the margins like ink in water.

[Character Name: Arthur Penhaligon]
[Class: Unassigned]
[Level: 1]
[HP: 10/10]
[MP: 10/10]

[Attributes]
[Strength: 5]
[Vitality: 5]
[Agility: 5]
[Intelligence: 5]
[Luck: 5]

[Available Points: 100]

"Okay," Artie said, his cynical instincts kicking into high gear. He’d played enough RPGs to know that 'Glass Cannon' builds were for people who enjoyed seeing a 'Game Over' screen every five minutes. "If I’m going into a world where slimes can actually kill me, I want to be a tank. Put eighty points into Vitality and twenty into Strength. I want to be a walking brick wall. I want to be the guy who takes a dragon’s breath to the face and asks if it’s getting drafty."

"Boring," Fizz said, yawning so wide her wings fluttered. "But fine. It’s your funeral. Again. I’ll just mark you down as 'Future Meat Shield' and call it a day."

Artie reached out, his finger hovering over the plus sign next to 'Vitality.' He pressed it.

The screen didn't respond. He pressed it again, harder this time. A spark jumped from the 'Vitality' bar to his fingertip—a sharp, stinging reminder of the Snack-O-Matic’s final revenge. 

"Uh, Fizz? The screen is doing that thing again. The 'I’m about to explode' thing."

"What thing?" Fizz looked up from her clipboard. "Oh, the glitching? Yeah, the System’s been a bit twitchy since the last patch. Just give it a firm—"

Before she could finish, the screen went wild. The lines of text began to scroll at terminal velocity. The 'Vitality' bar started to drain, the numbers dropping into the negatives before looping back around into symbols Artie didn't recognize. A phantom image of a 'Nacho Average Jalapeño' bag flashed across the UI, accompanied by a loud, crunchy sound effect that vibrated in his very marrow.

"What is happening?!" Artie yelled, trying to grab the edges of the screen to steady it.

"The electrical surge!" Fizz shouted, her wings flapping frantically as she flew backward. "Your soul is still carrying a residual charge from the vending machine! It’s overloading the input buffer! The System thinks you're trying to enter a cheat code through your nervous system!"

Artie watched in horror as the 'Available Points' counter plummeted to zero in a fraction of a second. The numbers weren't going into Vitality. They were pouring into a sub-stat he hadn't even noticed at the bottom of the list, a hidden menu that had expanded like a parasitic lung.

[Critical Probability: 100%]
[Critical Multiplier: 500%]

"Wait, stop! Undo! Ctrl-Z!" Artie lunged for the 'Reset' button, but his hand passed right through the flickering light. 

The System voice boomed, sounding remarkably smug for a collection of algorithms. "Stat Allocation Finalized. Recalculating survivability parameters... Error. Logic Loop Detected. Balancing 'Absolute Offense' with 'Absolute Fragility.' Applying corrective nerfs to maintain world-tier equilibrium."

[System Notification]
[Warning: Statistical Anomaly Detected.]
[Attribute 'Vitality' has been reduced to minimum threshold to compensate for 'Critical Probability' overflow.]
[Trait Acquired: Glass Cannon (Legendary/Cursed)]
[Description: You hit like a god, but you have the structural integrity of a wet paper towel.]

Artie’s jaw dropped as he watched his HP bar shrink. It didn't just go down; it withered. It became a tiny, pathetic sliver of red that looked like it would vanish if he even thought about a sharp object.

[HP: 1/1]

"One?" Artie whispered, his voice cracking. "I have one hit point? Fizz, I have one hit point! That’s not a health bar, that’s a binary state! I’m either alive or a puddle! If I trip over a pebble, I’m dead! If I get a papercut from a quest scroll, I’m dead!"

Fizz flew closer, squinting at the screen through a pair of tiny, conjured spectacles. She whistled low. "On the bright side, you have a one hundred percent critical hit rate. That’s... actually impossible. The cap is usually forty percent for Level 1s. You’ve basically broken the math of the universe before even stepping foot in it. You're a walking glitch, Arthur."

"I don't care about the math!" Artie waved the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) around, nearly hitting Fizz. "A stiff breeze will kill me! A moderately aggressive squirrel could end my entire second life! I wanted to be a brick wall, not a soap bubble!"

"Well, look at it this way," Fizz said, tucking her clipboard away as the void began to dissolve into white pixels at the edges. The ozone smell was being replaced by the scent of pine needles and damp earth. "You won't have to worry about long-term medical bills. It’s a 'Crit or Quit' build, Arthur. Very trendy. Very high-stakes. You just have to be perfect. Every. Single. Time."

"I hate high-stakes! I’m a middle-manager! I live for low-stakes!"

"Too late," Fizz said, her form beginning to fade into a shower of golden sparks. "The transport sequence is already locked in. Pro tip: Don't get hit. At all. Ever. If you see something pointy, run. If you see something blunt, run faster. See you on the other side, Anomaly!"

"Fizz! Wait! Fix the math! Carry the one! Do something!"

Artie reached out, but the System Void collapsed in on itself with the sound of a thousand crashing servers. His last thought, before the world turned into a blinding flash of light and the sensation of gravity suddenly returning with a vengeance, was that he really should have just bought the granola bar instead.

## The First Spawn

The transition from the flickering blue void of the System’s waiting room to the physical world felt less like a magical teleportation and more like being shoved out of a moving car into a pile of damp laundry. 

Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon hit the grass with the grace of a dropped sack of flour. He didn't even fall from a height; he simply materialized six inches above the ground and succumbed to gravity. Yet, the moment his chest brushed the clover, a terrifying red flash strobed across his vision, accompanied by a sound like a klaxon muffled by a heavy blanket.

[Warning: Kinetic Impact Detected!]
[Damage Negated: Tutorial Grace Period (0.9s remaining)]
[Current HP: 1/1]
[Note: You are currently one aggressive sneeze away from a permanent 'Game Over'. Please exercise extreme caution, or don't. The System enjoys the paperwork either way.]

Artie lay perfectly still, his cheek pressed against a blade of grass that looked suspiciously sharp. His heart hammered against his ribs—a frantic, rhythmic reminder that his entire existence now hung by a thread of code thinner than a spider's silk. "I’m alive," he whispered, the words catching in a throat that felt like it was lined with sandpaper. "Or at least, I’m not dead again. Yet."

"Oh, good! You didn't shatter on impact," a cheery, high-pitched voice chirped from somewhere above his left ear. 

Artie rolled onto his back with the agonizing slowness of a man trying not to trigger a pressure-sensitive landmine. Fizz was hovering there, her translucent wings buzzing with a sound like a malfunctioning drone. She looked down at him, her tiny face twisted into an expression of morbid curiosity, her hands tucked into the small pouch at her waist.

"Welcome to the Tutorial Zone, Artie! It’s green, it’s lush, and it’s statistically likely to be the last thing you ever see," she said, doing a little loop-de-loop that sent a spray of Sparkle Dust over his nose. "How’s the 1 HP treating you? Feeling... fragile? Brittle? Perhaps a bit like a Faberge egg in a rock tumbler?"

"I feel like a glass statue in a seismic testing facility," Artie grunted. He pushed himself up, his movements jerky and precise. Every joint felt like it was made of porcelain. He checked his right hand, his fingers tightening around the grip of the Rusty Shortsword. The prop—the same one that had acted as a lightning rod for the Snack-O-Matic 3000 back in the office—was still there, its metal cold and pitted. It looked even more pathetic in the sunlight of this new world, the rust flakes glinting like sad, orange glitter.

He patted his pockets with his left hand, careful not to jostle his own frame. The dead weight of his smartphone and his wallet were still there. Small, useless comforts from a life ended by a bag of 'Nacho Average Jalapeño' chips.

"Okay," Artie said, standing fully upright and swaying slightly as the wind caught his jacket. "I’m in the game. I’ve got the sword. I’ve got the guide. Now, where’s the easy stuff? Give me a quest to pick flowers or talk to a confused villager. Something that doesn't involve moving parts or, you know, physics."

"About that," Fizz said, pointing a tiny, shimmering finger toward a patch of nearby bushes. "The System doesn't really do 'peaceful' for anomalies. It prefers 'stress-testing'. And you, Artie, are the ultimate stress test."

The bushes parted with a soft rustle. Out wobbled a creature that, in any other context, would have been adorable. It was a translucent, neon-green blob about the size of a beach ball. It had two black dots for eyes and a permanent, mindless smile etched into its gelatinous face.

[Lesser Forest Slime - Lvl 1]
[HP: 10/10]

"It’s a slime," Artie said, his voice flat. He leveled the rusty prop sword at the creature, his right arm trembling slightly. "It’s the literal bottom of the food chain. I could probably kill it by looking at it funny."

"True," Fizz agreed, crossing her arms as she floated at eye level. "But remember that whole 'stat allocation' fiasco back in the void? You know, where you let a stray electrical charge from your vending machine death dump all your points into Critical Probability instead of Vitality?"

Artie winced. The memory of the UI glitching, the bars sliding all the way to the right while he screamed in the blue darkness, was still fresh. "I remember. I wanted to be a tank. I wanted to be unkillable."

"Right. Well, the System has a sense of irony. That Slime has an attack power of 2. You have a maximum health of 1. Do the math, Artie. In this world, that jiggling pile of lime gelatin is essentially a tactical nuke. If it so much as brushes against your shoelaces, you’re going back to the vending machine in the sky."

The slime let out a wet, squelching sound and began to hop toward him. It wasn't fast—it moved with the rhythmic, leisurely pace of a toddler—but every time it hit the ground, the vibration felt like a tremor to Artie’s heightened, terrified senses.

"Stay back," Artie warned, his voice rising an octave. "I mean it. I’ve got a 100% Crit rate. I’ll vaporize you into a puddle of floor cleaner."

The slime didn't care. It didn't have ears, a brain, or a sense of self-preservation. It just had a hunger for anything that wasn't green. It hopped again, closing the distance to three meters.

Artie took a step back, his boots crunching on the dry grass. His heel caught on a protruding root, and he nearly tumbled. The red warning flash returned instantly, pulsing at the corner of his eye as his balance wavered.

[Caution: Environmental Hazard! Stability at 42%. Fall damage is lethal for entities with < 2 HP.]

"Are you kidding me?" Artie hissed, flailing his left arm to steady himself while keeping the sword pointed forward. "I can die from tripping? Who designed this? I want to speak to a developer! I want to file a bug report!"

"The developers are busy counting the souls of people who died to vending machines and faulty toasters," Fizz said, floating just out of reach. "Focus, Artie! If that thing touches your boots, you’re done. It’s a 'Contact Damage' type. Very basic. Very lethal for a man with the constitution of wet tissue paper."

The slime lunged. It wasn't a fast jump, but it was aimed directly at Artie’s shins. 

Artie scrambled backward, his breath coming in ragged gasps. He wasn't just afraid; he was insulted. He was a grown man being hunted by a dessert. He swung the rusty sword in a wide, desperate arc, but the slime was already mid-recoil, its gelatinous body absorbing the vibration of the air. The blade whistled through empty space, the weight of the swing nearly pulling Artie off his feet.

"Swing harder!" Fizz encouraged, though she sounded like she was enjoying the show. "Or, you know, run. Running is good. I highly recommend running as a primary combat strategy for the rest of your very short life."

Artie didn't need to be told twice. He turned and bolted toward a cluster of ancient-looking oaks. Every footfall felt like a gamble. Every time his boots hit the uneven soil, he expected the System to inform him that he’d shattered his ankles and died of shock. 

[Stamina: 14/20]
[Warning: Low Stamina. Movement speed will be penalized shortly.]

"I have twenty stamina?" Artie yelled over his shoulder, his lungs already burning. "I’ve seen smokers with better lung capacity than this avatar!"

"You put zero points into Endurance, Artie! You’re lucky you can walk and talk at the same time without fainting!"

He reached the first tree, a massive thing with bark as thick as armor plating. He spun around, his back hitting the rough wood. He braced himself, absorbing the impact with his knees to avoid another 'Critical Impact' warning. 

The slime was still coming. It had rounded the bushes and was now ten feet away, its mindless smile seemingly wider now, as if it knew it had its prey cornered. It squelched, a sound of pure, unadulterated hunger.

Artie gripped the hilt of his sword with both hands now, his knuckles white. He was backed against the tree, the rough bark scraping against his shirt. To his left, a steep drop-off into a ravine. To his right, thick thorny brambles that would surely trigger a 'Bleed' effect—which, for him, was just another word for 'Deletion'.

"Okay, okay," Artie muttered, his eyes locked on the bouncing green menace. "One hit. That’s all I need. 100% Crit. If I land one blow, it’s over. I just have to not die first."

"And if it lands one hop?" Fizz asked, hovering right in his line of sight, her expression unhelpfully cheerful.

"Then I hope the next guy who tries to get those Jalapeño chips has better luck than I did."

The slime paused, its base expanding as it prepared for a larger leap. Artie held his breath, the rusty sword trembling in his hands. He was a glass cannon in a world made of hammers, and the first hammer was about to drop.

The Level 1 Lesser Forest Slime was, by all reasonable metrics of biological classification, a joke. It was a translucent, lime-green wobbling mass that looked like it had been harvested from the bottom of a cafeteria Jell-O tray. It didn't have teeth, it didn't have claws, and it moved with the urgent speed of a glacier on a coffee break. But to Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon, this wobbling puddle of citrus-flavored malice was the Grim Reaper in gelatinous form.

Artie’s back was pressed hard against the rough, furrowed bark of a massive oak tree. The tree was a titan of the Tutorial Zone, its branches sprawling like the veins of the earth against the digital blue of the sky. It felt solid. It felt permanent. It was the only thing keeping Artie from collapsing into a heap of existential dread.

[Lesser Forest Slime - Lvl 1]
[HP: 10/10]
[Attack: 2]

The floating red text above the creature was a death sentence. Artie looked down at his own status bar, hovering in the periphery of his vision like a nagging headache.

[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[HP: 1/1]

"Two damage," Artie whispered, his voice cracking. "It does two damage. I have one hit point. I am literally a soap bubble in a world made of needles."

The slime rippled. A wet, rhythmic *thwack-thwack-thwack* echoed through the clearing as it compressed its body, preparing to lunge. Artie gripped the hilt of his weapon. The Rusty Shortsword (Prop) felt exactly like what its name suggested: a piece of painted plastic and cheap foam that had been left in a damp basement for a decade. The 'Prop' tag wasn't just a descriptor; it was a warning that the System didn't consider this a real weapon.

"Okay, Artie. You were a data analyst. You deal in probabilities. You have a one-hundred percent critical hit rate. The math is on your side," he lied to himself. His palms were sweating, making the grip of the sword slick and unreliable. "You just have to touch it. One touch, and the math does the rest."

The slime launched. It didn't so much leap as it did undergo a sudden, violent change in state from 'puddle' to 'projectile.' It sailed through the air, a wobbling green sphere of doom aimed directly at Artie’s chest.

"Get back!" Artie roared, swinging the rusted blade in a wide, desperate arc.

The sword whistled through the air. Artie felt the weight of the swing, saw the blade pass directly through the center of the slime’s translucent mass. He braced for the impact, for the spray of green goo, for the sweet satisfaction of a kill.

[Miss!]

The word appeared in bright, mocking yellow text right where the slime should have been. The creature sailed past Artie’s shoulder, its sticky surface missing his tunic by a fraction of an inch. It hit the ground with a sound like a wet beanbag and immediately began to turn around.

"What? I hit that! I saw the blade go through it!" Artie screamed at the sky. "The collision detection in this place is garbage! I want to speak to a developer!"

The System did not respond with a developer. It responded with the slime compressing itself again.

Artie didn't wait for the next lunge. He stepped forward, determined to end this before his heart gave out from sheer terror. He raised the sword high above his head and brought it down in a vertical chop, a move he’d seen a thousand times in RPGs. The slime was stationary, recovering from its landing. It was a sitting duck. A sitting lime.

[Miss!]

The sword didn't hit the slime. It didn't even hit the ground where the slime was. Instead, the blade seemed to deflect off an invisible curved surface, sliding to the left and burying itself deep into a protruding root of the oak tree. The jar of the impact traveled up Artie’s arm, making his elbow scream in protest.

"Two!" Artie gasped, tugging at the sword. It was stuck. "That’s two! How can I miss a target that isn't even moving? I’m standing right on top of it!"

The slime didn't care about his frustrations. It lunged again, this time aiming for his knees. Artie panicked, yanking the sword free with a burst of adrenaline-fueled strength and jumping backward. He swung the blade blindly as he moved, a horizontal lash meant to keep the monster at bay.

[Miss!]

The slime flattened itself into a pancake, the rusted metal passing harmlessly over its gelatinous 'head.' It looked up at him—or at least, it oriented its mass toward him—with what Artie could only interpret as smug satisfaction.

"Three," Artie whimpered. He was breathing hard now, the air in the Tutorial Zone tasting like ozone and pine needles. "The System is rigging the rolls. It has to be. It gave me the crit rate, but it’s nerfing my accuracy to compensate. It’s a balance patch in real-time!"

He was backed against the tree again. The slime was circling him now, its movements becoming more fluid, more confident. It knew he was a glass cannon. It knew that one mistake, one slip of the foot, and Arthur Penhaligon would be a memory.

The slime launched a fourth time. It was a high, looping jump, designed to come down on Artie from above. He saw it coming. He timed it. He lunged forward with a thrust, aiming the tip of the 'Prop' sword at the very center of the falling green mass.

[Miss!]

The sword slid off the slime’s side as if the creature were coated in industrial-grade Teflon. The momentum carried Artie forward, and he nearly face-planted into the grass. He scrambled back to the tree, his legs shaking.

"Four! That’s four misses!" he yelled, his voice rising to a hysterical pitch. "I am a statistical impossibility! I am the one-percent of the one-percent! I am the king of the whiff!"

The slime was preparing its final assault. It began to vibrate, its green hue deepening to a dark, bruised emerald. The ground beneath it seemed to hum with gathered energy. This wasn't just a lunge; it was a 'Heavy Attack.'

Artie looked at the sword. It was a joke. He looked at the slime. It was a killer. He looked at the oak tree. It was a witness.

"One more," Artie whispered. "Just give me one hit."

The slime exploded off the ground. It moved faster than before, a blur of green malice. Artie swung with everything he had left. He didn't aim for the center. He didn't aim for the edges. He just swung at the space where the monster was.

[Miss!]

The sword hit a low-hanging branch of the oak tree, snapping it clean off. The branch fell, bouncing off Artie’s shoulder and landing in the dirt. It didn't do damage, but it was the final, crushing weight on his spirit.

"Five," Artie said, his eyes wide. The slime was inches from his face, its translucent body expanding as it prepared to engulf him. "I missed five times. This is it. I’m going to be killed by a dessert."

Time slowed down. It was a classic trope, the moment of clarity before the end. He could see the individual air bubbles trapped inside the slime. He could see the way the sunlight refracted through its body, casting a green glow on his own terrified face. He could see the 'Attack: 2' text hovering like a neon sign.

And then, something in the back of Artie’s mind—the part that had spent years analyzing spreadsheets and finding the one outlier in a sea of data—clicked.

The 100% Critical Hit Rate wasn't a stat. It was a law. And the System, for all its snark and its 'Prop' swords, was bound by its own laws. The misses weren't failures of skill; they were the System trying to delay the inevitable. But the math had reached its limit. The probability had collapsed into a single, unavoidable point.

Artie didn't swing. He didn't even move his arm. He just let his wrist twitch. A tiny, insignificant flick of the rusted blade. A glitch in the animation of his own despair.

The tip of the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) touched the very edge of the slime.

The world didn't just end; it was rewritten.

[SUPER-MEGA-ULTRA-CRIT!]

The sound was not a physical noise. It was the sound of a billion calculators screaming in unison. A pillar of pure, blinding golden light erupted from the point of contact, a column of celestial fire that reached from the scorched grass to the very top of the skybox.

The Level 1 Lesser Forest Slime didn't die. It didn't even have time to trigger a death animation. It was simply deleted. Its pixels were torn apart, its data scrubbed from the local memory, its very existence turned into a cloud of glowing green vapor that was instantly incinerated by the heat of the crit.

But the crit wasn't satisfied with one level-one mob.

The energy wave hit the oak tree. The hundred-year-old giant, the titan of the Tutorial Zone, vanished. There was no sound of splintering wood, no groan of falling timber. There was only a roar of displaced air as the tree was reduced to ash and light in a fraction of a second. The shockwave expanded, carving a perfect, circular crater into the earth, twenty feet wide and ten feet deep. The edges of the pit were glassed, glowing with a dull, angry red heat.

Artie was thrown backward, but the System’s physics—or perhaps its sheer confusion—kept him on his feet. He stood on the edge of the smoking ruin, his arm still raised, the 'Prop' sword glowing with a faint, dying ember of gold.

Silence returned to the forest. It was a heavy, unnatural silence, broken only by the sound of a few stray leaves that had survived the blast fluttering down into the crater.

Then, the notifications began to scroll.

[System Notification]
[Target: Lesser Forest Slime (Lvl 1) - DEFEATED]
[Damage Dealt: 9,999,999 (Overkill)]
[Experience Gained: 50 XP]

[Level Up!]
[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon: Level 1 -> Level 2]
[Stat Points Gained: 5]
[Note: Please try to leave some of the environment for the other players. The janitorial sub-routines are complaining about the sudden increase in 'Ash-Related' tickets.]

Artie stood there, his mouth hanging open. He looked at the crater. He looked at the empty space where a massive tree had been seconds ago. He looked at the sword in his hand, which was still rusted, still cheap, and still labeled as a 'Prop.'

"I..." Artie started, his voice a dry, hacking rasp. He swallowed hard. "I think I might be a little bit broken."

He checked his status bar.

[HP: 1/1]
[Level: 2]

He was still one stiff breeze away from death. He was still a glass cannon. But he had just deleted a piece of the world's geometry because he’d finally stopped missing.

"Level two," he breathed, a hysterical, high-pitched laugh bubbling up in his throat. "I’m level two. And all it took was the total destruction of a local ecosystem."

He sat down on the edge of the crater, his legs finally giving out. The dirt was still warm, the heat seeping through his trousers. He reached into his pocket, feeling the familiar, comforting weight of his dead smartphone and his wallet. They were relics of a world where slimes didn't exist and trees didn't turn into light.

"Okay," Artie said to the empty, smoking clearing. "If that was a level one slime... I really, really need to find some armor that isn't made of 'Prop' material. Or maybe a shield. A very, very big shield."

He looked at the sword. In his hands, it no longer felt like a toy. It felt like a detonator.

"One hit," he muttered, his eyes reflecting the dying glow of the crater. "One hit is all it takes. Now I just have to figure out how to not miss the next five times."

The sun continued to shine, the birds (the ones that hadn't been vaporized) began to chirp again, and Arthur Penhaligon, the Level 2 Glass Cannon, began to plan his next move in a world that was clearly not prepared for his arrival.

The smoke from the vaporized oak tree hadn't even cleared before the System started chirping in Artie’s ear like a caffeinated cricket. The crater beneath his boots was still cooling, the edges of the dirt turned to a jagged, obsidian-slick glass by the sheer magnitude of the overkill. He stood in the center of the devastation, his right hand still white-knuckled around the hilt of the Rusty Shortsword (Prop). It felt less like a weapon now and more like a detonator for a tactical nuke.

[System Notification: Combat Resolved!]
[Experience Gained: 500 (Overkill Bonus: +450%)]
[Level Up! You are now Level 2.]
[Stat Points Gained: 5 (Unallocated)]

"Five points," Artie wheezed, waving his left hand to clear the acrid scent of burnt cellulose and ionized slime. "I almost die to a puddle of grape jelly, blow up a landmark, and all I get is five points? I could put these into Vitality and I’d still be one stubbed toe away from a game over screen."

"Don't be ungrateful, Artie," Fizz said, fluttering down to hover just outside the range of the lingering heat. She looked remarkably pristine for someone who had just witnessed a localized disaster. "Most players have to spend hours bopping bunnies to get that kind of progress. You just skipped the tutorial curve and went straight to 'Environmental Hazard' status. The System loves a good show."

Artie looked at the floating blue window displaying his stats. 

[Name: Arthur Penhaligon]
[Level: 2]
[HP: 1/1]
[Crit Rate: 100% (FIXED)]
[Available Stat Points: 5]

The '1/1' pulsed with a faint, mocking red light. It was a constant reminder that in this world, Artie wasn't a hero; he was a fragile piece of glass being carried through a rock-throwing contest. He reached out a finger to tap the '+' next to Constitution, but hesitated. The math just didn't add up.

"If I put all five into health," Artie asked, "how many hits can I take from that slime's bigger brother?"

Fizz tilted her head, her translucent wings humming. "Let's see. Base Level 1 Slime damage is 2. Your current HP is 1. If you dump all five points into Vitality, assuming a standard 5-to-1 scaling ratio... you'd have 26 HP. So, about thirteen hits."

"Thirteen?" Artie scoffed. "That’s not a build. That’s a slightly more durable snack. If I’m going to be a glass cannon, I might as well wait until I can afford the bulletproof glass. I'm keeping the points for now. Maybe there's an 'Evasion' stat I can dump them into later so I never get touched in the first place."

"Suit yourself," Fizz shrugged, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "But look on the bright side. You’ve triggered the 'First Blood' reward protocol. The System is feeling generous. Or at least, as generous as a line of code can be."

A golden light began to coalesce in the air three feet in front of Artie. It wasn't the soft, ethereal glow of a holy spell; it was the harsh, flickering neon of a 'Grand Opening' sign at a discount mattress store. With a sound like a slide whistle, a heavy object materialized and dropped toward the ground.

Artie’s heart skipped. He lunged forward, catching the object in his left hand just inches before it hit the glassed floor of the crater. 

"Easy there!" he gasped, his knees trembling. "If this thing had hit the ground and made a vibration, I’d probably have shattered into a million pieces. Does the System not understand the concept of 'fragile'?"

[Item Acquired: The Participation Trophy (Tutorial Edition)]
[Rarity: Rare (Cursed)]
[Type: Accessory / Held Item]
[Stats: +1 Charisma, +5% Ego]
[Hidden Stat: ???]
[Description: You did it! You survived long enough to press a button. This trophy is gold-plated, hollow, and surprisingly heavy. It serves as a reminder that even the most incompetent efforts deserve a shiny trinket.]

The trophy was a hideous thing—a golden figure of a generic adventurer tripping over a rock, mounted on a faux-marble base. It was nearly a foot tall and shimmered with a luster that felt... aggressive. It sat heavy in his left hand, the cold metal biting into his palm.

"Charisma?" Artie looked at the trophy in his left hand, then at the rusty prop sword in his right. "I’m in a death-trap RPG and the game gives me a paperweight that makes me more likable? I don't want to be liked, Fizz. I want to be not-dead. This thing is literally a statue of someone failing."

"Oh, it's not just for show," Fizz said, her voice dropping an octave into a tone that Artie was beginning to recognize as 'foreshadowing.' "The System doesn't give out 'Rare' items for nothing. Check the acoustics, Artie. Listen to the rhythm of the world."

"The acoustics?"

Artie shifted his grip on the trophy. As the base of the statue rubbed against his palm, it emitted a low, resonant hum. It wasn't a pleasant sound. It was a rhythmic, thrumming vibration that seemed to bypass Artie’s ears and go straight to his marrow. It felt like a heartbeat—one that wasn't his.

*Thump-thump. Thump-thump.*

The sound began to grow. It wasn't just a hum anymore; it was a broadcast. A golden ripple of light pulsed out from the trophy every two seconds, expanding across the crater and into the surrounding woods like a sonar ping for predators.

[System Warning: 'Aggro Aura' Active.]
[Loudness Level: Spinal Tap (11/10)]
[Effect: You are now the most interesting thing in a five-mile radius. Good luck.]

"Fizz," Artie said, his voice tight as he watched the golden ripples wash over the treeline. "Why is the trophy screaming in light? And why does it feel like the forest just stopped breathing?"

"It’s not screaming," Fizz corrected, looking toward the shadows where the bushes were beginning to shift with alarming speed. "It’s announcing. It’s telling every monster in the Tutorial Zone that there’s a Level 2 anomaly with 1 HP and a very shiny, very expensive-looking prize standing right in the middle of a clearing. It’s basically a dinner bell that rings in 'Legendary' rarity."

A low growl echoed from the north. Then a wet, squelching sound from the east—the sound of multiple slimes congregating. To the south, the brush began to rustle with the frantic energy of a dozen approaching entities.

"Is this the 'Participation' part?" Artie asked, his knuckles whitening around the trophy’s base. "As in, I have to participate in my own funeral?"

"Run would be my suggestion," Fizz said, already beginning to fly toward the western path. "The 'Aggro Aura' is a passive effect. It doesn't turn off until you leave the zone or... well, until the trophy finds a new owner. Usually by looting it off your cold, pixelated corpse."

Artie didn't wait for a second opinion. He tucked the 'Participation Trophy' under his left arm like a golden football, his right hand still white-knuckled around the hilt of the Rusty Shortsword. He scrambled out of the crater, his boots slipping on the smooth glass. 

As he reached the rim, he saw them. Six Lesser Forest Slimes were bouncing toward him from the undergrowth, their translucent bodies filled with the half-digested remains of local flora. Behind them, a pair of 'Lvl 4 Mangy Coyotes' broke through the brush, their eyes locked onto the golden glow emanating from Artie’s armpit.

[Lvl 4 Mangy Coyote] [HP: 60/60]
[Status: Hungry / Highly Attracted to Shiny Things]

"I hate this game!" Artie screamed, his lungs burning as he sprinted toward the narrow gap between two ancient oaks. "I hate the rewards! I hate the math! I especially hate the interior decorating!"

"Less complaining, more cardio!" Fizz shouted over her shoulder, her trail of sparkle dust marking the path. "If one of those coyotes so much as sneezes on you, you’re a ghost! And not the cool, haunting kind!"

Artie pushed his legs harder. His Stamina bar appeared in the corner of his vision, draining with every desperate stride.

[Stamina: 45/100]

Every time the trophy pulsed—*thump-thump*—the monsters behind him let out a collective howl or squelch of renewed vigor. It was like he was carrying a GPS tracker that also insulted the monsters' mothers. He could hear the heavy breathing of the coyotes, the snapping of twigs, and the rhythmic *thump* of the trophy against his ribs.

"Where is the edge of the zone?" Artie yelled, leaping over a protruding root that definitely would have killed him if he’d tripped. 

"Just past the brook!" Fizz pointed toward a shimmering line of blue-white light in the distance. "The Tutorial Zone boundary! Monsters can't cross it without a permit, and most of them are terrible at paperwork!"

"Do they look like they’re checking for permits?" Artie glanced back. The coyotes were gaining. One of them lunged, its snapping jaws missing Artie’s heel by a fraction of an inch. 

[Warning: Near-Miss! 0.1m proximity detected.]

"Too close!" Artie veered wildly to the left, his heart hammering against his chest harder than the trophy’s aura. He could see the boundary now—a shimmering curtain of energy that marked the end of the 'safe' area. He sprinted with everything he had left, the golden trophy glowing brighter with every step, a beacon of doom leading the way toward the exit.

## The Safe Zone?

The soles of Artie’s sneakers hammered against the packed dirt of the North Road, each impact vibrating straight up his shins and threatening to shatter his precarious 1 HP existence. Behind him, the low-poly snarls of a pack of Mangy Coyotes faded into the distance, but the air around him still hummed with the sickly, neon-green throb of the Aggro Aura.

In his left hand, the Participation Trophy (Tutorial Edition) pulsed like a radioactive heart. In his right, the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) felt less like a weapon and more like a lightning rod for bad luck.

"Almost... there..." Artie wheezed. His stamina bar was a flickering sliver of yellow, hovering dangerously close to the 'Exhausted' debuff.

"Pick up the pace, Artie! You’re running like a man who hasn't seen a gym since the Clinton administration," Fizz chirped, hovering effortlessly beside his head. She was upside down, lazily spinning in the air while checking a translucent scroll. "Also, you’re trailing a very angry Level 5 Coyote. It’s about thirty meters back and looks like it hasn't had breakfast. Or a bath. Ever."

"I’m... doing... my... best!" Artie managed to choke out. 

The gates of Oakhaven finally loomed ahead—massive, iron-banded timber walls that promised the sweet, sweet safety of a non-combat zone. Two guards stood under the shadow of the archway, leaning on halberds with the practiced apathy of men who had seen too many level-one idiots die in the dirt.

As Artie stumbled into the 'Scanner Range' marked by a faint blue line on the road, he heard the guards talking. They weren't reaching for their weapons. They were reaching for small, leather-bound ledgers.

"Told you," the guard on the left said, squinting through a visor. He had a nameplate that read [Guard Hovis - Lvl 15]. "Look at the gait. That’s a sub-five Agility if I ever saw one. Five silver says he trips before the line."

The second guard, [Guard Barnaby - Lvl 14], snorted. "No way. Look at the panic. That’s a 'Fear' buff if I’ve ever seen it. Fear gives a hidden +2 to sprint speed. I’ll take that bet, and I’ll raise you another five that his Vitality is so low he’s practically a ghost already."

"Hey!" Artie yelled, his voice cracking. "A little help? Monster? Behind me?"

Hovis didn't even look up from his ledger. "Processing is at the gate, kid. Stay in the lane. If you die before the scanner hits you, the bet’s a wash, Barnaby."

Artie reached the blue line, his heart hammering against his ribs—a sensation that, in this world, felt like a literal countdown to a Game Over.

[System Notification: Entering Oakhaven Scanning Perimeter. Please remain still for Stat Validation.]

"Still?" Artie screamed, glancing over his shoulder. The Mangy Coyote was visible now, a blur of grey fur and yellow teeth, kicking up a cloud of dust as it accelerated. The Aggro Aura on the trophy in Artie's left hand flared bright green, practically screaming *Eat Me* to the local wildlife. "I can't remain still! There is a literal apex predator trying to turn me into a statistic!"

"Statistically speaking," Fizz said, popping a piece of spectral bubblegum, "you already are one."

A shimmering curtain of light descended from the archway. It was a pale, clinical blue that smelled faintly of ozone and old library books. As Artie crossed the threshold, the light hit him, and for a second, time seemed to stutter.

The scanner didn't just beep. It groaned.

[Scanning...]
[Name: Arthur Penhaligon]
[Level: 2]
[HP: 1/1]
[Critical Hit Rate: 100%]

The blue light turned a violent, strobe-light red. A siren, high-pitched and dissonant like a dial-up modem screaming in agony, erupted from the gatehouse.

[WARNING: STATISTICAL ANOMALY DETECTED]
[DATA CORRUPTION SUSPECTED: VALUE 'HP' OUTSIDE STANDARD DEVIATION]
[DATA CORRUPTION SUSPECTED: VALUE 'CRIT_RATE' EXCEEDS SYSTEM CAPS]

Hovis and Barnaby both jumped, their ledgers flying into the dirt. 

"What the hell?" Barnaby shouted, shielding his eyes. "Is the machine breaking? I’ve never heard the 'Anomaly' siren before. Not since that guy tried to smuggle a Bag of Holding inside another Bag of Holding."

"Look at the readout!" Hovis pointed to a floating display above the gate. 

The display was flickering, trying to render Artie's stats for the public record, but the numbers were spinning so fast they looked like a blur of static. Then, the text settled into a jagged, pixelated font:

[SUBJECT: ARTIE]
[THREAT LEVEL: UNKNOWN / PATHETIC]
[STATUS: 1 HP / 100% CRIT]
[SYSTEM NOTE: How are you even alive?]

"One HP?" Hovis whispered, his jaw dropping. "Barnaby, you owe me ten silver. That’s not just low Vitality, that’s... that’s a rounding error."

"Forget the silver!" Barnaby yelled, pointing past Artie. "Look at what he brought with him!"

The Level 5 Mangy Coyote hit the scanning perimeter at full tilt. Normally, a wild animal would avoid the scent of civilization, but the Participation Trophy’s aura was an irresistible siren song of pure, concentrated hatred. The coyote didn't even slow down; it lunged, its eyes fixed on the glowing trophy in Artie's left hand.

"Panic!" Artie yelled, which was less of a tactical command and more of a lifestyle choice. He swung his right hand wildly, the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) whistling through the air.

He didn't hit the coyote. He hit the air *near* the coyote. 

[Critical Hit! - 0 Damage (Prop Weapon Penalty)]
[System Note: You successfully critted the atmosphere. The air molecules are very upset.]

The shockwave of the 'Air-Crit' didn't hurt the monster, but the sheer mathematical impossibility of the hit caused a localized vacuum. The coyote’s lunge was jerked six inches to the left, its teeth snapping shut on empty air just centimeters from Artie's throat.

"Help! Guards! Do your jobs!" Artie scrambled backward, tripping over his own feet and falling flat on his ass.

[HP: 1/1]
[System Notification: Falling damage negated due to 'Pathetic Grace' hidden modifier. You are too light to impact the ground with force.]

"The kid's a virus!" Barnaby shouted, finally drawing a heavy iron mace. "Hovis, help me clear the aggro before the scanner explodes!"

Hovis leveled his halberd and stepped forward with a sigh. "This is going to be so much paperwork. I hate anomalies."

With a practiced thrust, Hovis drove the halberd into the coyote’s flank. The beast yelped, its focus finally breaking from the trophy as the guard’s superior level and stats took over. Barnaby followed up with a crushing blow from his mace, turning the Level 5 threat into a heap of dissolving pixels in seconds.

[Combat Ended]
[Experience Shared: 0 (Subject did not contribute meaningful damage)]
[System Note: Flailing is not a combat style.]

Artie sat in the dirt, clutching the trophy to his chest, his breath coming in ragged gasps. The red strobe light of the scanner was still pulsing, casting long, rhythmic shadows against the gate.

"You," Hovis said, walking over and looming over Artie. He poked Artie’s shoulder with the blunt end of his halberd. "Don't move. I need to see if you’re going to pop."

"I'm not going to pop," Artie snapped, though he wasn't entirely sure. "I'm just... efficient. I put all my points into the good stuff."

"Kid, you put all your points into a death wish," Barnaby said, shaking his head as he picked up his ledger. "One HP? A sneeze would send you back to the respawn shrine. And we don't even have a respawn shrine in Oakhaven. It's under renovation."

"Wait, what?" Artie looked up, his face paling. "No respawn? Then where do people go when they die?"

"Usually into a very small box," Fizz said, appearing on Artie's shoulder and patting his cheek. "But don't worry! I'm sure your '100% Crit' rate will protect you from the crushing reality of permanent deletion. Probably."

The siren finally died down, replaced by a low, rhythmic thumping sound from the gatehouse. A small slot opened in the stone wall, and a wooden token clattered out, landing in the dirt next to Artie. 

The token was bright orange and had a large, black 'A' stamped on it.

"Pick it up," Hovis commanded.

Artie reached out and grabbed the token.

[Item Acquired: Anomaly ID Tag]
[Type: Quest Item / Mark of Shame]
[Description: You are officially a Statistical Anomaly. This tag alerts all town NPCs that your existence is a bug in the System. Expect higher prices, deeper suspicion, and frequent 'Safety Checks' from local authorities.]

"Great," Artie muttered, pushing himself to his feet. He dusted off his jeans, though the 'Participation Trophy' in his left hand continued to hum with a faint, lingering green light. "Is there a 'I’m Just a Victim of Circumstance' tag I can trade this for?"

"Move it along, Anomaly," Barnaby said, gesturing toward the town square beyond the gate. "The Mayor's going to want to hear about you. We haven't had a 1 HP build since 'The Great Math Collapse' of '04, and that guy died because he sat on a particularly sharp piece of cheese."

"I'll be careful with the dairy," Artie said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. 

He started walking, his legs still shaking. As he passed through the archway, he felt the heavy gaze of the guards on his back. They weren't betting on his stats anymore; they were watching him like a bomb that might go off at any second.

"So," Fizz said, zipping ahead of him into the bustling streets of Oakhaven. "First stop: the tavern? Or should we go straight to the blacksmith and see if he can turn that 'Prop' sword into something that actually kills things instead of just offending the laws of physics?"

Artie looked down at the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) in his right hand. The blade was chipped, the hilt was loose, and it was currently his only hope of survival in a world where a stiff breeze was a boss fight.

"Tavern," Artie said firmly. "I need a drink. And I need to find a way to get rid of this trophy before it attracts a dragon or a very aggressive squirrel."

"Good luck with that," Fizz laughed. "Cursed items are like bad reputations—they’re really hard to scrub off."

Artie stepped into Oakhaven, the 'Anomaly' tag swinging from his belt, a Level 2 glitch in a world governed by hard numbers.

The Gilded Tankard was exactly the kind of place a man with 1 HP should avoid: it had slippery floors, heavy oak furniture with sharp corners, and a chandelier that looked like it was held up by a single, optimistic piece of twine. But Oakhaven’s streets were currently teeming with people who had seen the "Statistical Anomaly" flare at the gate, and Artie needed a roof that didn't involve a public interrogation.

He stepped through the swinging doors, his fingers cramping around his gear. He held the Rusty Shortsword (Prop) in his right hand—less of a weapon and more of a tactical nuke in his hands—and the glowing, neon-purple Participation Trophy in his left. The trophy was vibrating. It wasn't a "you did a good job" vibration; it was a "I am a beacon for every hungry thing within a three-mile radius" hum.

[Warning: Aggro Aura (Active)]
[Radius: 15 Meters]
[Current Threat Level: Low (For now...)]

"I hate this thing," Artie whispered. "Fizz, if you’re lurking in the UI somewhere, just know I’m going to melt this down into a very expensive paperweight the first chance I get."

The tavern was surprisingly quiet for midday. A few patrons sat in the shadows, their eyes tracking the bulge in Artie’s pocket where the Anomaly ID Tag sat. Even stowed away, the brass tag felt like it was radiating heat, a mark of shame that told the world he was a walking bug. He tried to find a corner, but the System—and his trophy—had other plans.

A floorboard creaked. Then came the scratching.

From beneath a nearby table, a pair of red eyes ignited. It wasn't a wolf or a goblin, but in this world, scale was relative.

[Tavern Rat - Lvl 1]
[HP: 3/3]
[Status: Extremely Agitated by Your Existence]

The rat was the size of a small badger and had a jagged scar across its snout. It hissed, its whiskers twitching in time with the trophy’s hum. The Aggro Aura was doing its job, which was to say, it was making Artie’s life a living hell.

"Oh, come on," Artie muttered, shifting his weight. "I’m Level 2. I’ve caused the death of a coyote. You really want to do this, Templeton?"

The rat lunged. 

It was a blur of grey fur and yellow teeth, aiming straight for Artie’s ankle. At 1 HP, a nip from a rodent wasn't a nuisance; it was a Game Over screen. Artie swung the Prop sword in a panicked arc. He didn't have the Agility for a clean parry, but he had the math.

[Critical Hit! -999 Damage]
[Overkill Bonus: +5 XP]

The sword didn't just hit the rat. It seemed to distort the air around it. Upon contact, the rat didn't die so much as it ceased to be a biological entity. There was a sound like a pressurized steam pipe bursting, and the rodent vanished in a cloud of fine, grey mist and a single, shimmering copper coin that clattered onto the floor.

"Clean-up on aisle four," Artie breathed, his heart hammering against his ribs. He looked at his health bar, which remained a terrifying, solitary [1/1]. "One hit. That’s all it takes. I’m living in a world made of needles and I’m a balloon."

"Impressive," a voice boomed from the back of the room. "Most adventurers at your level struggle with the vermin. You simply... deleted it."

Artie spun around, nearly tripping over his own feet. A man stood by the hearth, dressed in robes of deep burgundy and gold silk. He held a Bag of Gold in his left hand, the coins clinking with a heavy, rhythmic weight. On his chest sat a heavy silver medallion: the Seal of Office.

[Mayor of Oakhaven - Lvl ???]
[Disposition: Opportunistic]

"You're the Mayor," Artie said, not lowering the sword. 

"I am Mayor Whitlock," the man said, stepping forward. He glanced at Artie’s pocket, then back to his face. "And you are the 100% Crit. The gate guards haven't stopped talking about the man who critted the very air itself to survive a coyote."

"It was a fluke," Artie said quickly. "I’m actually very weak. Look at my HP. I’m basically a stiff breeze away from a funeral."

Whitlock smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. "In most places, 1 HP is a tragedy. In Oakhaven, it’s a curiosity. But a 100% Critical Hit rate? That, my friend, is an industry."

The Mayor gestured to a private booth. "Sit. Please. I believe we have much to discuss regarding your... utility."

Artie hesitated, then sat, keeping the trophy on the table where he could see it. The Aggro Aura was still humming, making the nearby ale-mugs rattle. 

"Utility?" Artie asked. "I'm not a Swiss Army knife. I'm a glass ornament."

"You don't understand our economy, Arthur," Whitlock said, leaning in. He pulled a small, glowing crystal from a pouch at his belt. It pulsed with a soft, blue light. "This is an Essence Shard. It is the fuel for our enchantments, the power for our wards, and the only currency the High Priests of RNG accept for Tier-3 gear."

Artie looked at the shard. "And let me guess. You don't find these in the dirt."

"No," Whitlock said. "Essence Shards are minted. They are the crystallized residue of 'Excessive Force.' When a blow lands with enough mathematical perfection—a Critical Hit, specifically—the System bleeds off a small amount of raw data. We capture that data and forge it into shards."

Artie felt a cold lump form in his stomach. "So, a normal fighter crits maybe five percent of the time?"

"If they're lucky," the Mayor said. "They spend hours in the pits, swinging until their arms go numb, hoping for that one-in-twenty spark to fill a single shard. But you... you are a font. Every strike you land, no matter how small, is a perfect release of energy. You aren't just an adventurer, Arthur. You are a walking mint."

[New Discovery: The Crit-Economy]
[Information: Your 100% Crit rate can be harnessed to generate Essence Shards. Value: Extreme.]

"You want to turn me into a battery," Artie said, his voice flat. 

"I want to offer you protection," Whitlock countered. "Oakhaven is a dangerous place for an Anomaly. There are... elements... who would see your 1 HP as an invitation. But under my patronage, you would have the finest guards. You would spend your days in a secure vault, striking a target dummy. We would provide the Shard-Cages, and you would provide the hits. You’d be the wealthiest man in the province without ever having to risk a scratch."

Artie looked at his character sheet, which flickered in his peripheral vision.

[Name: Artie Penhaligon]
[Level: 2]
[HP: 1/1]
[Unallocated Stat Points: 5]

The "plus" icons next to Vitality and Strength pulsed, urging him to commit. If he put all five into Vitality, maybe he’d have 50 HP. Maybe he’d survive a fall or a stray splinter. But the moment he spent those points, he was playing the System’s game. He was accepting the 'proper' path. And the 'proper' path in this world seemed to lead directly into a gilded cage.

"I'm not interested in being a battery," Artie said.

Whitlock’s smile faltered. "Arthur, be reasonable. Look at your stats. You have five points sitting there, unspent. You're terrified to use them because you know that even with them, you’re still fragile. Why struggle in the wild when you can be a god in a basement?"

"Because in the basement, you own the key," Artie said. He stood up, grabbing the trophy. The Aggro Aura flared as he moved, and another rat scurried across the rafters above, lured by the scent of his existence.

"You're making a mistake," Whitlock said, his voice dropping an octave. "There are others who won't be as polite as I am. Vane, for instance, has very little patience for 'anomalies' that don't serve the greater good."

Artie didn't wait to hear more. The word 'scouted' was flashing in his mind like a neon sign. He wasn't a guest; he was a resource.

He turned and bolted for the exit, the Participation Trophy's purple glow trailing behind him like a comet's tail. He burst through the swinging doors back into the afternoon sun of Oakhaven. He needed to hide. He needed to find a place where the math didn't matter, or at least a place where people didn't know how to count his crits.

The cobblestones of Oakhaven weren't designed for sprinting, especially when you were carrying a glowing golden trophy that pulsed with the rhythmic insistence of a neon "Eat at Joe's" sign. I ducked around a corner, my breath hitching in a chest that felt like it was made of wet cardboard. 

[Stamina: 42/100]

"Come on," I hissed, shifting the weight of the Participation Trophy (Tutorial Edition) in my left hand. The damn thing felt heavier with every step, and the Aggro Aura was practically humming, a low-frequency vibration that made my teeth ache. Somewhere nearby, a stray cat hissed, its fur standing on end as the trophy’s "come-and-get-me" magic tickled its primitive brain.

I needed to disappear. Mayor Whitlock’s offer of becoming a "Crit-Battery" sounded less like a job and more like a life sentence in a gilded hamster wheel. I wasn't about to spend the rest of my isekai experience in a basement, punching rocks to mint currency for a man who smelled faintly of mothballs and corruption. 

I turned into a narrow passage between a weaver’s shop and a warehouse, hoping the shadows would swallow the glow of my "Statistical Anomaly" status. I didn't get five feet before the air ahead of me shimmered, turning a sharp, crystalline blue.

"Moving a bit fast for a man with only one hit point, aren't you?"

The voice was like expensive silk being dragged over a whetstone. I skidded to a halt, my boots sparking against the stone. 

Standing at the end of the alley was a man who looked like he’d been airbrushed by a team of professional vanity-propagandists. He wore plate armor so polished I could see my own terrified, sweat-streaked reflection in his breastplate. A blue velvet cape draped over one shoulder, pinned by a brooch that probably cost more than my entire previous life's net worth. 

He didn't just have a name tag; he had a title hovering in shimmering gold letters.

[Vane - Lvl 24 - Paladin of the Radiant Roll]

"Vane," I muttered, my right hand tightening around the hilt of my Rusty Shortsword (Prop). The system-mandated label was still there, mocking me.

"So, the rumors are true," Vane said, stepping forward. His movements were fluid, effortless. He had the kind of Agility stats that made physics look like a suggestion. "A Level 2 glitch walking around with a 100% Critical Hit rate. Do you have any idea how much that offends the natural order of the Leaderboards? It’s untidy. It’s... offensive."

"I’m more of a 'happy accident' than a glitch," I said, trying to edge toward the wall. "Think of me as a localized patch that hasn't been applied yet. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a very important appointment with not-being-here."

Vane chuckled, a sound that made me want to punch him in his perfect, symmetrical teeth. He reached down and rested a hand on the hilt of his weapon—an Ornate Rapier with a guard shaped like a soaring phoenix.

"Oakhaven is a town of commerce, Penhaligon. But I am a man of metrics. I don't believe in anomalies. I believe in testing the variables until they break. And you, my friend, look very, very breakable."

With a flick of his wrist, the rapier was out. It didn't just draw; it sang. A high, clear note that resonated in the narrow space.

[System Notification: Vane (Lvl 24) has challenged you to a Friendly Duel!]
[Type: First Blood / To Yield]
[Stakes: 100 Gold Pieces (Auto-debited on loss)]
[Accept? Y/N]

The holographic window popped up right in my line of sight, glowing with a persistent, annoying blue light. A translucent fence began to shimmer into existence around us, cordoning off the alleyway.

"A 'friendly' duel?" I asked, my voice cracking. "I have one hit point, Vane. Your 'friendly' sneeze would send me back to the login screen. And I don't even have a hundred gold! I’m currently worth about three copper and a bag of lint."

"The System will simply put you into debt," Vane said, his eyes narrowing. "As for the health... well, that’s the point, isn't it? If you're truly a 100% Crit-machine, you should be able to end this before I even finish a lunge. Let’s see if that 'Prop' sword of yours can actually draw blood, or if you're just a walking UI error."

He stepped into a duelist’s stance, the rapier leveled at my throat. The tip of the blade was so steady it looked like it was frozen in time.

"Accept the challenge, Anomaly. Or I’ll just wait for the timer to expire and the System to auto-accept on the grounds of 'Cowardice Clause 4-B'."

I looked at the 'Y/N' prompt. It was pulsing. 

"You know," I said, my mind racing. "There’s a very specific rule about duels in the Oakhaven Municipal Code. And the System is very big on municipal codes."

Vane smirked. "Oh? Enlighten me."

I held up my right hand, the one clutching the rusted, notched blade. "This isn't a weapon. Check the tag, Vane. Use your Basic Analysis."

Vane frowned, his eyes flickering as he scanned the sword. I saw the moment he realized it. 

[Item: Rusty Shortsword (Prop)]
[Damage: 0-1]
[Note: For theatrical use only. Not suitable for combat.]

"It’s a prop," I said, my confidence growing as I saw the logic-loop forming in his eyes. "The System Duel protocol requires both participants to be equipped with a 'Valid Combat Instrument.' I am currently equipped with a 'Theatrical Accessory.' Therefore, the duel is legally invalid. You can't start a duel if one party is technically unarmed."

Vane’s brow furrowed. "That’s a technicality. You used it to kill a coyote at the gate. I saw the logs."

"I used it to crit a coyote," I corrected him. "The physics engine did the work, not the weapon. But for a formal Duel? The System needs a weapon it can calculate 'First Blood' from. You can't draw blood with a prop sword unless the other guy is a really bad actor. The sub-routine won't even initialize."

Vane growled, his rapier dipping slightly. The blue fence around us flickered, turning a muddy purple as the System struggled to reconcile the challenge with my inventory.

[System Warning: Invalid Duel Parameters Detected. Checking Equipment Validity...]

"You're a coward," Vane spat. "Hiding behind a label."

"I’m a man who enjoys having a pulse," I countered. I looked down at the Participation Trophy in my other hand. It was still glowing, and the air in the alley was starting to feel heavy. The Aggro Aura was at peak intensity, and I could hear scratching coming from the sewer grates.

"And speaking of labels... do you know what this is?" I held the trophy out toward him. 

"It’s a trophy. A participation prize for losers," Vane said, his lip curling in disgust.

"Actually, it’s a beacon," I said. "And I think the Oakhaven local fauna just got the invite."

In the distance, I heard the baying of something that definitely wasn't a dog. The Aggro Aura was pulling in every hostile entity within three blocks. A swarm of Level 4 Alley Rats began pouring out of the sewers, their eyes red and fixed entirely on the trophy in my hand. They were the size of small badgers, with teeth that looked like they could chew through plate mail.

"What are you doing?" Vane demanded, stepping back as the first rat leaped at his shin.

"I’m canceling the duel due to 'External Interference'," I yelled. 

I didn't wait for the System to finish its Equipment Check. I threw the Participation Trophy... not at Vane, but over him, deeper into the alley. 

Vane instinctively turned to follow the arc of the glowing gold object. It was a reflex. Even high-level Paladins can't resist a shiny loot-drop, or at least the instinct to track a projectile.

As the trophy clattered to the ground behind him, the swarm of rats ignored me entirely, surging past my legs like a furry, squeaking tide. They went straight for Vane and the trophy.

[System Notification: Duel Canceled. Combatants are currently in an 'Aggro-Zone'.]

"You little—!" Vane started, but he was forced to bring his rapier up to parry a leaping rat that was aiming for his throat. "Get off me, you vermin!"

"Enjoy the fans, Vane! They really seem to like your metrics!" I shouted. 

I didn't stick around to see how a Level 24 Paladin handled fifty rats. I turned and bolted back the way I came, my boots pounding against the stone. I ducked into a side street, then another, twisting through the narrowest gaps I could find, my heart hammering against my ribs like a trapped bird.

I didn't stop until I was deep in the backstreets, the air smelling of old cabbage and damp laundry. I leaned against a wall, my lungs screaming for mercy.

[Stamina: 5/100]

I reached into my pocket and felt the cold metal of the Anomaly ID Tag. I pulled it out, looking at the flickering text. 

"Statistical Anomaly," I whispered. "Yeah. And a giant pain in the neck."

I had escaped the Mayor, and I had insulted the most powerful-looking guy in town. My social standing was currently somewhere below 'Plague Carrier,' and I was officially out of trophies. But I was alive. 

[New Thread Started: The Vane Vendetta]
[Description: You’ve insulted a Paladin's pride and used a technicality to avoid his blade. He won't forget the 'Prop' incident. Or the rats.]

"Great," I muttered, sliding the tag back into my pocket. "More content. Just what I needed."

I looked around at the darkening alley. I was broke, I had 1 HP, and the most dangerous man in Oakhaven probably wanted to turn me into a very expensive puddle. 

"Welcome to the game, Artie," I told myself. "Try not to die before the first save point."
