# Chapter 1: Welcome to the RNG-Hellscape

## The Exit Interview

The spiral coil of the Snack-Master 4000 groaned, a sound like a rusted gate in a horror movie, and then stopped. It didn’t just stop; it mocked. The bag of Zesty Ranch Glitch-O’s dangled by a single, microscopic corner of plastic, suspended over the precipice of the delivery chute. 

Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stared through the smudged glass, his reflection staring back with the hollow, haunted eyes of a man who had spent the last six hours staring at Excel spreadsheets that refused to balance. His mousy brown hair, usually just "unruly," had reached a state of chaotic defiance, sticking out in tufts that mirrored his internal state. He was a Junior Analyst, a title that sounded professional but mostly meant he was the person people blamed when the coffee ran out.

The Leather Wallet felt heavy in his right hand, a useless slab of cowhide that had just surrendered four dollars for a snack it refused to surrender. Artie looked down at the Leather Wallet, then back at the chips. 

"You've got to be kidding me," Artie muttered. His voice was raspy, the product of too much recycled office air and not enough social interaction. 

He adjusted the Corporate ID Badge hanging from his neck. The plastic lanyard was frayed, the clip digging into his collarbone. The photo on the badge showed a younger, more optimistic Artie, one who hadn't yet realized that "upward mobility" was a myth designed to keep people from jumping out of the third-story windows. 

In his right pocket, his Cracked Smartphone buzzed. Probably another notification from the project manager asking if the Q3 projections were ready. Artie ignored it. The projections weren't ready. The projections would never be ready. The only thing that mattered right now was the bag of chips.

Artie leaned his forehead against the cool glass of the machine. He could see the faint outline of a vending machine scar on his right knuckle, a jagged little reminder of the Great Snickers Standoff of last winter. He had won that fight. He would win this one.

"Listen, you overpriced box of scrap," he whispered. "I’ve had a very long day. My boss told me my 'synergy' was lacking. My car made a noise this morning that sounded like a cat in a blender. And I just want my Glitch-O's."

The machine didn't respond. It just hummed, a low-frequency vibration that seemed to vibrate his very teeth. 

Artie’s patience, a resource that had been dwindling since he’d clocked in at 8:00 AM, finally hit rock bottom. He wasn't just a Junior Analyst anymore. He was a man with a grievance. He was a man who had been pushed too far by a piece of automated retail equipment.

He shifted the Leather Wallet to his left hand and balled his right hand into a fist. He aimed for the sweet spot—the area just to the left of the keypad where the internal sensors lived. It was a move he called "Percussive Maintenance," a skill he had leveled up through years of dealing with subpar office technology.

*Thump.*

The machine rattled. The bag of chips swayed. For a glorious second, gravity seemed to remember its job. The corner of the bag slipped a fraction of a millimeter.

"Yes," Artie hissed. "Come to papa."

But the bag held. It was as if the plastic had bonded with the metal coil on a molecular level. 

Artie’s frustration boiled over into a cold, focused rage. He put his Leather Wallet on the small ledge beneath the keypad and gripped the sides of the machine. He began to shake it. The Snack-Master 4000 was heavy, bolted to the floor in a way that suggested the manufacturers knew exactly how people like Artie would react to its failures.

"Give! Me! My! Chips!" 

He punctuated each word with a violent shove. Inside, the rows of candy bars and granola snacks danced, a rhythmic jiggling of high-fructose corn syrup. The Glitch-O's remained unmoved.

Artie stopped, panting. His slight build wasn't meant for this kind of physical exertion. He wiped sweat from his pale forehead and looked at the delivery flap at the bottom. It was a heavy metal door, designed to prevent "shrinkage"—the corporate term for people stealing snacks.

He knelt on the linoleum floor, the fluorescent lights overhead flickering in a way that gave him a mounting headache. He pushed the flap open. It resisted, the spring-loaded hinge snapping back against his fingers. 

"Ow! Son of a—"

He sucked on his bruised knuckle, the one with the old scar. This was personal now. The machine hadn't just stolen his money; it had drawn blood. 

He reached back in, shoving his arm up into the dark, narrow chute. His fingers brushed against something cold and metallic. He could feel the internal mechanism, the wires and the gears that governed the distribution of snacks. 

"I can feel you," he grunted, his shoulder pressed against the metal flap. "You're right there."

He stretched his arm further, his fingertips grazing the bottom of the chip bag. If he could just hook the plastic, he could pull it down. He ignored the "Do Not Reach Into Machine" warning sticker that was currently inches from his nose. That sticker was for people who had something to lose. Artie had nothing but a half-finished spreadsheet and a car that sounded like a blender.

His hand brushed against a loose wire. 

In that moment, the hum of the machine changed. It went from a low drone to a high-pitched whine. The flickering fluorescent light in the breakroom died, plunging the room into a dim, grey twilight. 

Artie felt a tingle in his fingertips. It wasn't the tingle of excitement. It was the tingle of several thousand volts of electricity deciding that his nervous system was a much more efficient path to the ground than the machine's actual wiring.

"Oh," Artie said. It was the only word he had time for.

The surge hit him like a physical blow. His muscles slammed shut, his hand clenching around the internal wiring of the Snack-Master 4000. He couldn't let go. He couldn't scream. He could only vibrate as the electricity cooked him from the inside out.

His vision didn't just go dark. It pixelated. 

The breakroom, the vending machine, the Corporate ID Badge hanging from his neck—it all started to dissolve into jagged blocks of color. The smell of ozone and burnt coffee filled his nostrils. He felt his heart skip a beat, then another, then simply stop trying altogether.

The Leather Wallet slipped from the ledge, hitting the floor with a dull thud. His Cracked Smartphone buzzed one last time in his pocket, a final, ignored request for a Q3 projection that would now remain forever unfinished.

Artie’s last thought wasn't about his family, or his unfulfilled dreams, or the crushing weight of corporate existence. 

It was about the chips. 

*I never even got to taste the Zesty Ranch,* he thought.

And then, the mundane world of spreadsheets and stuck snacks faded to a perfect, absolute black.

The void didn't smell like ozone or the afterlife. It smelled like a server room that hadn't been dusted since the late nineties. Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stood in the center of a black expanse that felt less like infinite space and more like a loading screen with the lights turned off.

"Oh, look. Another one. And this one's still wearing his lanyard. How professional."

Artie spun around, his hand instinctively reaching for the Corporate ID Badge hanging from his neck. A small, glowing blue sprite flickered into existence, trailing a wake of pixelated dust that looked like a GPU having a seizure. 

"Where am I?" Artie asked, his voice cracking. "I was just... the vending machine. The chips. There was a spark."

"The Snack-Master 4000 claimed another soul," the sprite said, her voice dripping with a boredom that spanned eons. "I'm Fizz. I’m your System Guide, though 'Guide' is a strong word for someone who mostly watches people like you make terrible life choices. You’re dead, Arthur. Welcome to the Character Creation Void. Try not to track mud on the nothingness."

[System Notification: Welcome, User 9,421,084!]
[Current Status: Deceased (Pending Resurrection)]
[Available Stat Points: 10]

A translucent blue screen shimmered into existence between them. It was filled with numbers, bars, and a list of attributes that made Artie’s head swim. He felt the weight of his Cracked Smartphone in his pocket, a useless brick of glass in this digital purgatory.

"Character creation?" Artie squinted at the screen. "Is this a game? I’m a Junior Analyst. I don't do games. I do spreadsheets."

"Then think of this as a very high-stakes spreadsheet where 'Error 404' means your soul gets deleted," Fizz said, hovering closer. "You have ten points. Put them into Strength if you want to hit things, Agility if you want to run away like a coward, or Vitality if you want to survive more than a stiff breeze. Hurry up. I have a three-o'clock with a guy who died choking on a grape."

Artie looked at the list. He saw 'Critical Hit Rate' at the bottom, currently sitting at a measly 1%. 

"Critical," Artie muttered. "That sounds important. In my performance reviews, 'critical thinking' was always the top metric. If I want to be efficient, I should maximize the critical stuff, right?"

"I wouldn't—" Fizz started, her glowing eyes widening.

Artie tapped the plus sign next to Critical Hit Rate. He didn't just tap it; his finger, still twitchy from the electrocution, spasmed. The '10' in his point pool vanished instantly.

[Warning: Stat Allocation Finalized!]
[System Error: Statistical Anomaly Detected!]
[Recalculating Build...]

"What did you do?" Fizz shrieked, her pixelated trail turning a violent shade of red. "You just dumped the entire starter pool into a sub-stat! You didn't even touch Vitality!"

Artie blinked as the screen turned a blinding gold.

[Build Confirmed: The Glass Cannon]
[HP: 1/1]
[Critical Hit Rate: 100%]
[Title Earned: Statistical Anomaly]

"One?" Artie stared at the HP bar. It was so thin it was practically invisible. "Why is my health one? I had ten points!"

"You had ten points to spend on *everything*, you absolute walnut!" Fizz hovered inches from his nose, her translucent blue face contorted in a sneer. "You put it all into Crits! You are now the deadliest thing in the world that can be killed by a moderately aggressive sneeze. You have the structural integrity of a wet paper towel!"

"But I have 100% Critical Hit Rate," Artie argued, trying to find the silver lining. "That means every hit is... critical?"

"It means you’re a glitch, Arthur. A walking, breathing math error." Fizz sighed, her glow dimming to a resigned teal. "The System hates math errors. It's going to try to 'balance' you. And by balance, I mean it's going to send everything in the tutorial zone to delete you from the census."

The floor beneath Artie began to vibrate. The blackness of the void started to crack, revealing flashes of a lush, green forest below.

"Wait, I'm not ready!" Artie grabbed his Corporate ID Badge as if the plastic sleeve could protect him. 

"Ready or not, here comes the grind," Fizz said, disappearing into a puff of blue code. "Try not to die in the first five seconds. It makes my paperwork look terrible."

The void dissolved. Artie felt a sickening lurch in his stomach as gravity suddenly remembered he existed. He plummeted toward the green canopy below, the wind whistling through his rumpled dress shirt.

[Tutorial Quest Initiated: Survive the Spawn]
[Objective: Reach the Safe Zone without taking damage.]
[Reward: A sense of self-worth and 10 XP.]

"I just wanted my chips!" Artie screamed as the trees rushed up to meet him.

## The First Spawn

The transition from the server-room-scented void to the Tutorial Zone felt less like a magical teleportation and more like being shoved through a high-definition meat grinder. One moment, Artie was arguing with a flickering blue sprite about his questionable life choices; the next, the floor vanished, replaced by the aggressive scent of pine needles and damp earth.

He hit the ground with a grunt that sounded remarkably like a spreadsheet being deleted. The impact wasn't hard—the grass was unnaturally lush, like it had been rendered with a high-end shader—but it was enough to make the blue plastic of his Corporate ID Badge slap against his collarbone. Artie lay there for a second, staring up at a sky so blue it looked like a default desktop wallpaper.

"Welcome to the great outdoors, Artie!" Fizz’s voice chirped from somewhere above his left ear. "Try not to breathe too much. The oxygen here is surprisingly addictive."

Artie rolled onto his side, his hand brushing against the rough bark of a nearby tree. The vending machine scar on his right knuckle throbbed—a jagged reminder of the Snack-Master 4000 and the electrical surge that had sent him here. He reached into his pocket, feeling the jagged, spiderwebbed glass of his Cracked Smartphone. It was dead weight now, a relic of a world where 'critical hit' usually referred to a server crash, not his own mortality.

He pushed himself up to a sitting position, and that’s when the world provided its first official greeting.

[System Notification: Welcome to the Tutorial Zone (Lush Forest)!]
[Quest Initiated: Survive the Spawn]
[Objective: Reach the Oakhaven Gates (0/1)]

"Survive," Artie muttered, the word tasting like copper. "That’s a bit ominous for a tutorial, isn't it?"

"Only if you're bad at games," Fizz said, hovering into his line of sight. She looked even more pixelated against the vibrant green of the forest, her neon blue hair flickering like a dying fluorescent bulb. "And considering you just dumped every single point into a stat that requires you to actually hit things before they hit you... well, 'ominous' is a polite way of putting it."

Artie ignored her and did what any self-respecting Junior Analyst would do: he checked the data.

[Character: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[Title: Statistical Anomaly]
[Level: 1]
[HP: 1/1]
[Crit Rate: 100%]

The '1/1' was pulsing. Not a friendly, 'hey look at me' pulse, but a rhythmic, warning-red throb that made his stomach do a slow roll. One. One single point of health. In his previous life, he’d survived a flu that felt like more than one point of damage. He’d survived a three-hour meeting with the Regional Director without a coffee break. But here, in this hyper-saturated forest, he was a single papercut away from deletion.

"Fizz," Artie said, his voice rising an octave. "Why is my health bar the size of a postage stamp?"

"Because you wanted to be a 'specialist,' remember?" She did a mid-air somersault, leaving a pixelated trail in her wake. "You’re the ultimate glass cannon, Artie! Except, you know, without the cannon part yet. Right now, you’re more like a glass... marble. Very shiny, very fragile, and likely to be stepped on."

A rustling sound came from the bushes to his right. It wasn't the gentle sound of the wind. It was rhythmic. Wet.

Schlorp. Schlorp. Schlorp.

Artie froze. His heart hammered against his ribs, each beat feeling like it might be the thing that finally shattered his 1 HP limit. Slowly, he turned his head.

Emerging from the undergrowth was a creature that looked like a giant, lime-flavored Jell-O mold that had developed a grudge against the world. It was translucent, wobbling with every movement, and its surface was flecked with bits of undigested leaves and what looked suspiciously like a very small, very dead squirrel.

[Lesser Puddle Slime - Lvl 1]
[HP: 15/15]

The slime didn't have eyes, but Artie could feel its intent. It was hungry, and he was the only thing on the menu that wasn't made of wood.

"Oh, look!" Fizz whispered, her voice dripping with mock-excitement. "Your first encounter! Usually, players use this to practice their basic attacks. You, however, might want to practice your 'running away while screaming' technique."

The slime contracted, its gelatinous body pulling inward like a rubber band being stretched to its limit. 

"Is it... is it supposed to do that?" Artie asked, scrambling backward. His heels dug into the soft loam, and he felt the Corporate ID Badge catch on a twig. He ripped it free, the lanyard snapping taut around his neck.

"That’s the 'Leap' animation, Artie," Fizz said, checking her nonexistent fingernails. "In about two seconds, it’s going to launch itself at your face. Given its velocity and your current lack of armor, I’d say the impact will deal approximately... oh, one point of damage."

"One point?" Artie yelped. "But that's all I have!"

"Exactly! It’s very efficient. No wasted numbers. The System loves efficiency."

The slime launched.

It was a slow-motion nightmare. The green mass soared through the air, a wobbling orb of predatory citrus. Artie threw himself to the left, his shoulder hitting the dirt and sending a jolt of alarm through his entire body. 

[Stamina: 95/100]

He scrambled up, his breath coming in ragged gasps. The slime hit the spot where he’d been standing a split second before with a wet thwack, leaving a shimmering trail of corrosive mucus on the grass. The grass hissed and turned brown instantly.

"Missed!" Artie shouted, the adrenaline finally kicking in. "You see that, Fizz? Junior Analyst reflexes! I used to dodge 'Reply All' chains for a living!"

"Great job," Fizz deadpanned. "Now do it again. It’s turning around."

She was right. The slime was reorienting itself, its body rippling as it prepared for another jump. Artie looked around wildly for a weapon—a rock, a sturdy branch, a heavy stapler—but there was nothing but soft earth and tall, mockery-filled trees.

He backed away, but his heel caught on a protruding root. He stumbled, his arms flailing for balance. He felt the weight of his Cracked Smartphone in his pocket, shifting as he fell toward a dense thicket of thorns. 

He stopped just short of the briars, cornered. The slime was five feet away, and this time, it wasn't just contracting; it was vibrating. A low, wet hum filled the air.

"Fizz, help me out here," Artie hissed, his eyes locked on the wobbling green death. "There has to be a tutorial tip for this. 'How to not die to a puddle of juice'?"

"Tip number one," Fizz said, appearing right in front of his nose. "Don't get hit."

"That’s not a tip, that’s a tautology!"

"Tip number two: You have a 100% Crit Rate, Artie. If you hit it, you hit it hard. But you actually have to, you know, hit it."

Artie looked at his hands. They were shaking. His right knuckle, with its vending machine scar, was white-knuckled as he balled his hand into a fist. He was a Junior Analyst. He was a 'Statistical Anomaly.' And right now, he was a man about to be killed by a dessert topping.

The slime lunged again. This time, there was no room to roll. Artie could see the flecks of dirt inside its body, the sheer weight of the thing coming right for his chest. If it touched me, the '1/1' in his peripheral vision would go to zero. The game would end before it even began.

He realized then, with a clarity that only comes when you're facing a lethal blob of jelly, that this world didn't care about his resume. It didn't care about his potential. It only cared about the math. And the math said he was one mistake away from non-existence.

"Oh, crap," Artie whispered as the green shadow eclipsed the sun.

The Lesser Puddle Slime didn’t have a face, but Artie could feel its judgment. It wobbled with a rhythmic, wet thrum, its translucent green body pulsing as it prepared to turn Artie’s one and only Hit Point into a memory. 

Artie’s back hit the thicket of thorns. The sharp pricks through his rumpled dress shirt were a reminder that the environment was just as lethal as the monster. He had ninety-five stamina and a dream of not dying in a tutorial.

The slime lunged.

Artie threw himself to the right, his dress shoes skidding on the damp grass. He felt the rush of cold, gelatinous air as the slime sailed past his shoulder, slamming into the thorns with a squelch.

[Stamina: 90/100]

"My turn," Artie wheezed, clenching his fist. The vending machine scar on his right knuckle throbbed. He swung a desperate haymaker at the puddle as it tried to untangle itself from the briars.

His fist passed through empty air. The slime had flattened itself like a pancake, the blow whistling harmlessly over its jiggly surface.

[Attack Missed!]

"Okay, warm-up. That was a warm-up," Artie muttered. He stepped back, trying to find his footing. The slime reformed, spinning like a top. It launched again, a low-altitude strike aimed at his ankles. Artie hopped over it, the effort sending a jolt of fatigue through his legs.

[Stamina: 85/100]

He pivoted and kicked. Or tried to. His foot connected with nothing but a stray leaf. The slime had rolled to the side with the grace of a professional gymnast made of Jell-O.

[Attack Missed!]

"Are you kidding me? It’s a puddle! How does a puddle have better evasion than a Junior Analyst?"

The slime didn't answer. It just bubbled. Artie lunged forward, trying a double-handed overhead smash. He put his whole weight into it, his Corporate ID Badge swinging wildly against his chest. The slime simply shifted its mass, creating a hole in the center of its body. Artie’s hands passed through the gap, and he nearly face-planted into the dirt.

[Attack Missed!]

[Stamina: 75/100]

"Three. That’s three," Artie gasped. He was starting to sweat. The humidity of the Lush Forest was doing no favors for his cotton shirt. The slime was circling him now, its green core glowing with a faint, predatory light. It hissed—a sound like a leaky radiator—and sprayed a glob of acidic bile.

Artie dove, rolling across the roots of a massive oak tree. The bile hit the wood behind him, hissing as it ate through the bark.

[Stamina: 70/100]

He came up swinging. A quick jab, the kind he’d seen in movies. The slime bobbed.

[Attack Missed!]

"Four!" Artie screamed. "I am literally a statistical impossibility! I have a hundred percent crit rate! I just need to touch you!"

The slime seemed to pause, its entire body vibrating. It looked like it was laughing. It began to bounce in place, a mocking, rubbery taunt. Artie felt a vein throb in his temple. He rushed in, swinging a wild, uncoordinated roundhouse punch. The slime ducked. It didn't even move far; it just lowered its profile by an inch, and Artie’s fist sailed over it yet again.

[Attack Missed!]

[Stamina: 60/100]

Artie stopped. His chest heaved. He looked at his hand—the one with the vending machine scar. He looked at the slime, which was now preparing for what looked like a final, high-velocity leap. 

"Fine," Artie whispered. "You want to play the RNG game? Let’s talk about the margin of error."

The slime launched. It was a perfect strike, aimed directly at Artie’s heart. In mid-air, it expanded, its body forming a wide net of corrosive slime designed to ensure there was no escape.

Artie didn't move. He waited until the green translucence filled his vision, until he could smell the ozone and rot. Then, he didn't punch. He didn't kick. He simply stepped forward and met the slime with a firm, rigid palm strike, right into the center of its glowing core.

The world didn't just make a sound; it ceased to have a medium for sound.

[CRITICAL HIT!]
[Calculating Damage...]
[Error: Value Exceeds Local Variable Limits]
[Statistical Anomaly Bonus Applied: 'The Glitch']
[Damage Dealt: 9,999,999,999 (Overkill!)]

A pillar of pure, white light erupted from Artie’s palm. The Lesser Puddle Slime didn't splatter; it ceased to exist at a molecular level. The force of the blow didn't stop there. The shockwave tore through the air, a localized vacuum that shrieked as it expanded. 

Behind the space where the slime had been, a massive, ancient tree—a trunk at least four feet thick—simply evaporated. There was no falling timber, no cracking wood. One moment it was a stalwart of the forest, and the next, there was a perfectly circular hole in the canopy and a scorched patch of earth where the roots used to be.

Silence returned to the forest, save for the sound of Artie’s heavy breathing and the faint clinking of his Corporate ID Badge.

Artie stared at his hand. It wasn't even singed.

[System Notification: Enemy Defeated!]
[Lesser Puddle Slime (Lvl 1) has been deleted from the database.]
[Experience Gained: 500 (Tutorial Bonus Applied)]

[LEVEL UP!]
[Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon: Level 1 -> Level 2]
[All Resources Restored.]

[Stat Points Gained: 5]
[Skill Points Gained: 1]

"Holy... crap," Artie breathed. He reached into his pocket and felt the cool, glass surface of his Cracked Smartphone. It was still there. He was still here.

[Warning: Reality Stability decreased to 44%. Please refrain from divide-by-zero combat maneuvers.]

Artie ignored the warning. He watched as his HP bar remained at a steady, terrifying 1/1, but his stamina bar surged back to full. He felt a strange, tingling warmth in his limbs—the sensation of growth, or perhaps just the lingering radiation of a billion-damage punch.

"I think," Artie said to the empty forest, "I'm going to like being an anomaly."

The smoke from the vaporized ancient tree was still stinging Artie’s lungs when the golden light manifested in front of his face. It didn't gently descend; it popped into existence with the obnoxious chime of a microwave finishing a bag of popcorn.

"Congratulations," Fizz said, her neon-blue form flickering with a static-heavy sigh. "You’ve successfully broken the tutorial's physics engine. I hope you’re proud of yourself. The System had to pull from the 'Emergency Compensation' pool for this one."

Artie reached out and grabbed the Participation Trophy floating in the air. It felt like cheap, gold-plated plastic.

[Item Received: Participation Trophy (Cursed)]
[Type: Cursed Accessory]
[Rarity: Rare (Glitch-Tier)]
[Description: Awarded to those who achieve a victory so statistically improbable that the System assumes you’re cheating but can’t prove it. It’s ugly, it’s heavy, and it smells like ozone and desperation.]
[Passive Effect: Monster Beacon – Your presence is now broadcast on all frequencies. Monsters within 1km are aware of your location and find your face personally insulting.]
[Note: This item is Soulbound. You can’t drop it. You can’t sell it. You can only regret it.]

"Wait, 'personally insulting'?" Artie looked down at the Participation Trophy in his left hand. It featured a small, golden figure of a man tripping over a rock while holding a calculator. "Fizz, what does 'Monster Beacon' actually do in numerical terms?"

"In numerical terms?" Fizz zipped around his head, her pixelated trail leaving a streak of blue light in the smoky air. "It means your Aggro Meter is about to become a vertical line. Look up, Artie. Quickly."

Artie looked. Above his 1/1 HP bar, a new UI element had appeared. It was a jagged red eye that was currently pulsing with an angry, rhythmic light.

[Aggro Meter: 94% (Rising...)]

A low, guttural growl echoed from the shadows of the remaining trees. Then another. And a third that sounded like a blender full of gravel. The "lush forest" suddenly felt a lot less like a tutorial zone and a lot more like a buffet where Artie was the only thing on the menu.

"The slime," Artie whispered, his heart hammering against his ribs. "The explosion. Did it attract them?"

"The explosion was the dinner bell," Fizz said, her voice rising an octave. "The trophy is the GPS coordinates. Artie, you have exactly one hit point. If a squirrel sneezes on you, we both go back to the void, and I get demoted to 'Loading Screen Tip' status. Run!"

[System Warning: Local Aggro Threshold Exceeded!]
[Status Inflicted: Marked for Death]
[Description: Every monster in the 'Lush Forest' sub-zone is now sprinting toward your coordinates. Good luck, Anomaly.]

Artie didn't wait for a second warning. He turned and bolted. His dress shirt, already rumpled and stained with office coffee and slime residue, billowed behind him. His Corporate ID Badge bounced painfully against his collarbone with every step.

[Stamina: 92/100]

The forest, which had seemed peaceful ten minutes ago, was now a cacophony of snapping branches and predatory shrieks. To Artie's left, a pair of glowing red eyes burst through a thicket of ferns. He didn't stay to see what they belonged to. He just focused on the distant, shimmering outline of stone walls on the horizon—Oakhaven.

"Is there a sprint button?" Artie wheezed, his lungs burning. "Because I really need a sprint button!"

"You're already using it! It's called 'Adrenaline and Terror'!" Fizz shouted, hovering effortlessly beside his ear. "Left! Go left! There’s a pack of Razor-Toothed Rabbits closing in from the right!"

Artie veered left, his boots skidding on a patch of moss. He nearly lost his balance, which would have been a death sentence.

[Stamina: 75/100]

[HP: 1/1]

The absurdity of it hit me even as Artie dodged a low-hanging branch. He was a Level 2 "Statistical Anomaly" with the power to vaporize gods, but he was currently being hunted by bunnies because he was holding a piece of plastic that made him smell like a target.

"Can I put the trophy in my pocket?" Artie yelled over the sound of something large and heavy crashing through the underbrush behind them.

"It’s a beacon, Artie! It doesn't matter if you put it in a lead box or up your—" Fizz cut herself off as a projectile—a glob of hardened sap—whistled past Artie's head, missing by an inch. "Just run! The gates are only two kilometers away!"

"Only two kilometers?" Artie looked at his rapidly depleting stamina bar. "I’m an analyst! I haven't run two kilometers since the elevator in the office broke in 2019!"

[Stamina: 60/100]

Behind him, the forest was alive with the sound of a hundred monsters converging on a single point. The Aggro Meter hit 100% and turned a dark, bruised purple. 

[New Quest: Run for Your Life!]
[Objective: Reach the Oakhaven Gate Scanners.]
[Reward: Not dying.]
[Failure: Deletion.]

"I hate this game," Artie panted, his vision starting to tunnel. "I really, really hate this game."

"Save your breath for the sprinting!" Fizz urged.

Artie gripped the Participation Trophy tighter, its golden surface mocking him in the dappled sunlight. He could see the gates now—massive, iron-bound structures guarded by men in shining armor. They looked safe. They looked solid. They also looked a very, very long way away.

Artie pushed his legs harder, the wind whipping past his ears as the first of the pursuers—a lean, grey wolf with far too many teeth—broke cover behind him. 

"Don't look back!" Fizz screamed.

Artie didn't. He just ran.

## The Safe Zone?

The soles of Artie’s loafers—entirely unsuited for a cross-country sprint through a magical forest—slapped against the packed dirt of the trade road with a wet, desperate rhythm. Behind him, the forest wasn't just rustling; it was screaming. A cacophony of chittering mandibles, wet sloshing, and the heavy thud of paws signaled the arrival of the tutorial zone’s entire ecosystem, all of them united by a singular, burning desire to murder a Junior Analyst.

"Faster, Artie! The Aggro Meter is pulsing red! That means it’s extra-angry!" Fizz zipped around his head, her neon blue hair trailing pixels like a dying GPU. 

[Aggro Meter: 110% (OVERFLOW)]
[Status: Monster Beacon - Active]
[Status: Marked for Death - Active]

"I'm... trying!" Artie wheezed. His lungs felt like they had been scrubbed with steel wool. In his left hand, he gripped the cold, heavy base of the Participation Trophy. The gold-plated plastic statuette of a generic hero seemed to pulse with a sickly, rhythmic light, acting as a literal flare for every predator within a kilometer. "Why... can't I... drop it?"

"It’s soulbound, Artie! It’s part of your 'Reward' for being so statistically improbable!"

[Stamina: 5/100] (Warning: Exhaustion Imminent)

The massive stone walls of Oakhaven finally loomed out of the twilight, a grey bastion of safety. Two guards stood atop the battlements flanking the heavy iron-shod gates. They weren't reaching for bows. They weren't sounding a horn. One was holding a slate, and the other was shaking a pair of dice.

"Fifty gold says he hits the dirt before the fifty-meter mark!" the guard on the left shouted, leaning over the merlon.

"You're on! Look at that form! He’s got the stride of a man who’s never seen a gym in his life!" the second guard yelled back.

Artie reached the shadow of the gate, his legs turning to jelly. He collapsed against the wood, the Participation Trophy clattering against the iron bands.

"Open... the gate!" Artie screamed, his voice cracking. 

The guard on the left, a burly man with a mustache that looked like a dead squirrel, peered down. "Hold your horses, traveler. Or, well, hold your monsters. We’ve got a procedure for high-aggro arrivals. Standard 'Anomaly' protocol."

[System Notification: Oakhaven Automated Defenses - Scanning...]

A beam of harsh, white light shot down from a crystal mounted above the gate, sweeping over Artie. He squinted, shielding his hazel eyes with his right hand, the vending machine scar on his knuckle white against his pale skin.

"Scanning? I’m about to be eaten by a swarm of Level 5 Dire-Squirrels and you’re scanning me?" Artie yelled.

"Quiet! You're messing with the calibration!" the guard snapped. 

[Scan Result: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[Level: 2]
[HP: 1/1]
[Crit Rate: 100%]
[Warning: Statistical Anomaly Detected]
[Threat Level: Paradoxical]

The guards went silent. The one with the dice dropped them. They clattered onto the stone walk above. "A hundred percent?" the guard whispered. "Hey, Bill, the scanner’s broken. It says he’s got a hundred percent crit rate."

"Check the HP, Ted," Bill replied, his voice trembling. "It says one. Not one hundred. One."

"I have one hit point!" Artie roared, pointing at the forest line where the first wave of monsters—a pack of snarling, bioluminescent wolves—burst into the clearing. "If a ladybug lands on me too hard, I explode! Open the door!"

"But the betting pool!" Ted protested. "If we let a Paradoxical Anomaly in without a proper handicap, the House of RNG will have our heads! What are the odds on a one-HP wonder surviving a gate-slam?"

Fizz hovered in front of the guards' faces, her white eyes glowing with irritation. "Listen, you glorified RNG-addicts! If you don't open this gate, the System is going to log a 'Failure to Protect' event, and your insurance premiums are going to skyrocket! Do you want to explain that to the Mayor?"

The mention of insurance premiums seemed to do what the threat of Artie’s death couldn't. 

"Fine, fine! Engaging the winch!" 

The gate groaned, the heavy chains rattling as the wood began to lift. It was agonizingly slow. Artie watched the wolves. They were twenty meters away. Ten. 

[Stamina: 1/100]

He lunged through the narrowing gap under the rising gate, dragging the Participation Trophy with him. The moment his heels cleared the threshold, the guards slammed the lever back. 

The gate didn't just close; it dropped like a guillotine.

*CRUNCH.*

The lead wolf’s snout was caught in the impact, followed by the dull thud of a dozen bodies slamming into the exterior of the gate. Artie scrambled back on his elbows, breathing in the smell of dust and old stone. 

[Quest Complete: Run for Your Life!]
[Reward: 50 XP, 10 Silver, 'Gate-Crasher' Title (Inactive)]

Artie lay flat on his back, staring up at the vaulted ceiling of the gatehouse. His rumpled dress shirt was soaked with sweat, and his mousy brown hair was a bird's nest of twigs and leaves.

"We're in," he whispered.

"We're in!" Fizz cheered, doing a loop-de-loop. "And look! You only almost died three times! That's a new personal record!"

Ted, the guard, walked down the stairs, looking at Artie with a mix of awe and deep suspicion. He held his slate out. "Sign here, 'Anomaly.' And keep that trophy covered. You're bleeding aggro all over my clean floor."

Artie looked at the Participation Trophy in his left hand. It was still glowing. 

"I hate this game," Artie said, reaching into his neck to adjust his Corporate ID Badge. "I really, really hate this game."

The Mayor of Oakhaven didn’t look like a man who held the keys to Artie’s survival. He looked like a man who had spent the last twenty years aggressively negotiating with a buffet. He sat behind a desk made of dark, polished ironwood, his watery blue eyes fixed on a hovering projection of Artie’s character sheet.

[Warning: Paradoxical Anomaly Detected]
[Subject: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[Current HP: 1 / 1]
[Critical Hit Rate: 100% (Hard-Capped)]

"One health point," the Mayor whispered, his voice a mixture of awe and professional greed. He adjusted the Seal of Oakhaven hanging from his neck; the heavy gold medallion clinked against his velvet robes. "And a guaranteed crit on every single interaction. Do you have any idea what you are, Mr. Penhaligon?"

"A mistake?" Artie suggested, shifting his weight. He was still clutching the Participation Trophy in his left hand. The cursed thing was vibrating again, emitting a low-frequency hum that made his teeth ache. "Look, I’m just trying to get through the day without a stray breeze deleting my existence. And this Participation Trophy is currently acting like a flare gun for every monster in a three-mile radius."

[Aggro Meter: 88% (Rising - Monster Beacon Active)]

The Mayor leaned forward, his ruddy face glowing in the light of Artie’s glitchy stats. "In Oakhaven, we don't call it a mistake. We call it a 'Market Disruptor.' Our entire economy is built on the scarcity of the Critical Hit. The nobility pay fortunes for gear that gives them a measly five percent boost. You? You’re a walking mint. You’re a one-man industrial revolution."

"I'm a one-man 'Game Over' screen if someone sneezes in my direction," Artie countered. He held up the Participation Trophy. "Can you fix this? The guards said you were the one to talk to about 'status stabilization.'"

The Mayor’s eyes flicked to the Participation Trophy, then back to Artie’s face. "Fix it? My dear boy, that 'Monster Beacon' is the only reason the wolves didn't stop at the gate. They want what you have. The System wants to 'balance' you, which in this world means erasing you. But Oakhaven... Oakhaven is a sanctuary for those who know how to hedge their bets."

He stood up, his portly frame straining against his robes. He walked to the window, looking out over the town where the bioluminescent streetlamps were beginning to flicker. 

"You are currently flagged as a Paradoxical Anomaly. The moment you step out of this office without my protection, the System Sentinels will find a reason to 'patch' you. And their patches usually involve a very permanent deletion of your data."

[System Notification: Reality Stability 44%]
[Warning: Localized Anomaly may further degrade stability.]

"So what's the catch?" Artie asked, his grip tightening on the Participation Trophy. "You don't strike me as the 'protection for the sake of charity' type."

The Mayor turned, a predatory smile stretching across his face. "I want a monopoly on your output. You stay in Oakhaven, under my 'mentorship.' You provide the Crits when I need a lock opened, a legendary item forged, or a political rival... inconvenienced. In exchange, I provide you with the 'Cloak of the Bureaucrat.' It won't give you more HP, but it will mask your Anomaly signature from the System's automated scans."

Artie looked at the Seal of Oakhaven around the Mayor's neck. It was more than just jewelry; it was a tether to the world's rules. He looked at his own 1 HP. 

"You're offering to hide me in plain sight," Artie said.

"I'm offering to make you the most valuable secret in the kingdom," the Mayor replied. "But we have to move fast. That Participation Trophy is screaming, and the city's internal sensors are already starting to log the 'Monster Beacon' status. If the Aggro Meter hits a hundred inside the walls, the automated turrets won't care if you're a guest or a glitch."

[Aggro Meter: 92%]

The hum from the Participation Trophy grew louder, a rhythmic thrumming that seemed to sync with Artie’s own frantic heartbeat. He was a Junior Analyst. He knew a bad deal when he saw one, but he also knew when he didn't have the leverage to ask for a better one. 

"Fine," Artie said, the word feeling like a lead weight in his mouth. "Tell me about this 'deal.'"

The Mayor’s smile widened, revealing a gold-capped tooth. "Excellent. Let's talk about your new career as Oakhaven's most guarded asset."

The heavy oak doors of the Mayor’s office thudded shut behind Artie, but they couldn't muffle the persistent, rhythmic thrum vibrating through his left palm. The Participation Trophy was glowing with a sickly, neon-orange light that seemed to pulse in time with his own frantic heartbeat. It wasn't just an item; it was a homing beacon for every bad decision in a fifty-mile radius.

Artie stepped onto the cobblestones of Oakhaven’s Town Square, and the atmosphere shifted instantly. The bustling market, filled with NPCs hawking "Crit-Chance Potions" and players comparing the glow of their enchanted codpieces, went silent. A literal path cleared in front of him. It wasn't out of respect; it was the biological imperative of every living thing to move away from a ticking time bomb.

[Aggro Meter: 95% (Critical Warning: Monster Beacon Active)]

"Great," Artie muttered, his fingers tightening around the cold, gold-plated base of the Participation Trophy. "I’m not a hero; I’m a localized natural disaster."

He tried to keep his head down, mousy brown hair falling over his hazel eyes, but it was hard to be inconspicuous when you were a walking rave. He adjusted the Corporate ID Badge hanging from his neck—a useless piece of plastic from a world where the biggest threat was a passive-aggressive CC’d email—and started toward the western gate.

He didn't make it ten paces.

A shadow fell across the stones, long and jagged like a serrated blade. The air temperature seemed to drop ten degrees, smelling suddenly of ozone and expensive leather. Artie stopped. His 1 HP pulsed in his vision, a tiny, fragile red sliver that felt like it was made of spun glass.

"So," a voice drawled, dripping with the kind of confidence only attainable by someone who has never been told 'no' by a vending machine. "You’re the Anomaly."

Artie looked up. Standing in the center of the square was a man who looked like he had been designed by a committee of people who thought 'subtlety' was a type of sandwich. He was tall, athletic, and clad in obsidian plate armor so polished Artie could see his own terrified reflection in the breastplate.

[Vane - Lvl 45]
[Title: Top 100 Slayer]
[HP: 500/500]

The man shifted, and the massive weapon held in his right hand caught the sunlight. The Obsidian Greatsword was a monstrosity of volcanic glass and cruel geometry, the edge so sharp it looked like it was cutting the air itself just by existing.

"I prefer 'Arthur,' or 'Artie' if we’re being casual," Artie said, his voice cracking only slightly. "And you are... wearing a lot of black for a sunny day. Isn't that hot?"

Vane didn't laugh. He didn't even blink. His steely grey eyes scanned Artie with the clinical detachment of a butcher looking at a side of beef. 

"I watched the gate logs," Vane said, stepping forward. The crowd retreated further, forming a wide circle of spectators. "One health point. A statistical impossibility. And yet, the scanners say you hit like a god. Or a glitch."

"It’s a very specialized build," Artie lied, his mind racing. "High risk, high reward. Mostly risk. Actually, it’s about 99% risk. Can I go now? I have a... thing. A meeting about a cloak."

Vane raised the Obsidian Greatsword, the tip hovering inches from Artie’s chest. The sheer presence of the weapon caused a [Danger] notification to flicker at the edge of Artie’s UI.

"I don't like glitches," Vane said softly. "They mess with the rankings. They make the hard work of players like me look... inefficient. I think I’ll see what happens when that one point of health meets a Level 45 Execute."

[Aggro Meter: 96% (Warning: Target Locked)]

"Whoa, hey!" Artie held up his right hand, while his left continued to clutch the Participation Trophy like a shield. "Let's talk about this. I’m a Junior Analyst. I do spreadsheets. I don't even know how to hold a sword properly. You’d be killing a man who once spent forty minutes trying to find the 'any' key."

"Then you won't mind a test," Vane said. 

He moved. To Artie’s eyes, it wasn't a movement so much as a teleportation. The Obsidian Greatsword swung in a horizontal arc, a black blur aimed directly at Artie’s neck. 

Artie didn't think. He didn't have time to think. His body, fueled by the pure, unadulterated cowardice that had kept him alive through three corporate restructures, simply gave out. His knees buckled, and he tripped over a loose cobblestone.

The black blade whistled through the space where his head had been a microsecond before. The force of the swing was so great it sent a shockwave of air that ruffled Artie’s hair and nearly tore the Corporate ID Badge from his neck.

[Dodge! (Luck: 100%)]
[System Note: That was pathetic, but effective.]

Artie scrambled backward on his backside, the Participation Trophy clunking against the ground. "See? Terrible fighter! I’m basically a toddler in a dress shirt!"

Vane frowned, his jet black hair perfectly in place despite the exertion. He looked at his sword, then back at Artie. "You didn't parry. You didn't even try to block. You just... fell."

"It’s my signature move," Artie gasped, his heart hammering against his ribs. "I call it 'The Sudden Lack of Skeleton.' It’s very advanced."

Vane’s eyes narrowed. The curiosity in them was being replaced by a cold, sharp irritation. He gripped the hilt of the Obsidian Greatsword with both hands now. "No one dodges me by accident. Not with my Agility stat."

"Maybe your math is off?" Artie suggested, slowly finding his feet while keeping the trophy between them. "Have you tried carrying the one? I find that’s where most people stumble."

The crowd was whispering now. A Level 2 had just 'dodged' a Top 100 Slayer. The logic of the world was straining, and Artie could almost feel the reality stability dipping. He needed to leave. Now.

"I’m going to hit you again," Vane said, his voice flat. "And this time, I’m using a Skill."

[Vane is casting: Whirlwind of the Void]

"Oh, look! Is that a Legendary Loot Drop behind you?" Artie yelled, pointing frantically toward the fountain.

Vane didn't even turn. "Cheap. Predictable."

"No, seriously, it’s glowing!" 

Artie didn't wait to see if Vane believed him. He turned and bolted. He didn't run like a hero; he ran like a man who had seen a spider in his shower. He ducked under the arm of a startled merchant, dived through a display of 'Authentic Dragon Scales' (which were clearly painted plywood), and sprinted toward a narrow alleyway between the alchemist’s shop and a tavern.

"Get back here!" Vane’s roar echoed through the square.

Artie didn't look back. He squeezed into the alley, the Participation Trophy humming a frantic, high-pitched note that set his teeth on edge. He could hear the heavy clank of obsidian armor behind him, the sound of a predator who wasn't used to his prey having a head start.

He saw a stack of empty crates and, without slowing down, delivered a sharp kick to the base of the pile.

[Skill Triggered: Percussive Maintenance (Rank F)]
[Critical Hit!]

The crates didn't just fall; they exploded into a chaotic mess of splinters and heavy wood, perfectly blocking the narrow passage behind him. 

"I’m sorry!" Artie screamed over his shoulder. "I’ll pay for those! Send the invoice to the Mayor!"

He burst out the other side of the alley, found himself in a residential backstreet, and didn't stop running until the Aggro Meter in his vision finally started to tick downward. He was alive. He was at 1 HP. And he had just made an enemy of the most dangerous man in the city.

"Welcome to Oakhaven," Artie wheezed, leaning against a stone wall and clutching the glowing trophy to his chest. "Where the air is fresh and everyone wants to murder me for my math."
