The transition from the Character Creation Suite to the Whispering Woods didn't feel like a majestic step into a new world; it felt like being shoved through a narrow pipe while wearing a suit made of sandpaper. One moment Arthur Penhaligon was staring at a snarky UI and a floating guide who looked like she’d rather be anywhere else, and the next, the smell of damp pine and rot hit him like a physical blow.

Artie stumbled, his feet catching on a stray root. His heart did a frantic tap-dance against his ribs.

"Easy there, Glass Joe," Fizz said, her voice floating down from somewhere above his left shoulder. She was lazily flipping through the Standard Guide's Manual, her translucent wings buzzing with a sound that reminded Artie of a failing fluorescent light. "The ground is technically an environmental hazard for you now. Try to stay vertical."

Artie froze, one hand gripping the rough bark of a nearby sapling to steady himself. His palm stung. Even that tiny friction felt dangerous, like the bark was trying to sand down his existence. He looked down at his hands—pale, trembling, and definitely not equipped for a world that wanted to kill him. 

"You’re kidding," he whispered, his voice cracking. "One HP? I’ve had papercuts more substantial than my entire life bar."

"Hey, you're the one who dumped everything into Crits," Fizz replied, not looking up from her book. "The System just balanced the scales. You’re the ultimate glass cannon, Artie. Minus the cannon part, for now. Right now, you’re just the glass."

Artie reached into his left pocket, his fingers brushing against his Leather Wallet. Then he checked his right pocket, feeling the cold, jagged edges of his Keyring. They felt absurdly heavy. His keys—the ones to an apartment he’d never see again and a car that was probably being towed from the office parking lot—were currently the most dangerous things he owned. If he fell on them, he was dead.

A low, wet sound echoed through the clearing. It wasn't a growl, exactly. It was more like someone dropping a giant bowl of gelatin onto a marble floor. 

Schlorp.

Artie turned his head slowly. Twenty feet away, the ferns parted. Emerging from the undergrowth was a creature that, in any other RPG, would have been the punchline of a tutorial joke. It was a translucent green blob, about the size of a beach ball, vibrating with a rhythmic intensity that made the grass beneath it quiver.

[Lesser Forest Slime - Lvl 1]
[HP: 10/10]

A tiny, red health bar hovered over its jiggly head. It looked harmless. It looked like something you’d find in a high-end candy store. But as it turned toward Artie, its entire body rippled, and he saw the way the acidic slime dissolved the fallen leaves in its path.

"Fizz," Artie said, his voice rising an octave. "Tell me that thing is a passive mob."

"Let's see," Fizz hummed, finally closing her manual with a snap. She squinted at the slime. "Lesser Forest Slime. Diet: organic matter, small rodents, and... oh, look at that. 'Unwary Level 1 Travelers.' It’s an aggressive-type. It probably thinks you’re a particularly crunchy snack."

The slime lunged. It didn't move fast, but it moved with a terrifying, mindless persistence. It compressed its body and then sprang forward, covering three feet in a single, wet hop.

"Move!" Fizz chirped.

Artie didn't need the prompt. He scrambled backward, his boots slipping on the mulch. Every step was a gamble. If he tripped, he died. If he hit a branch, he died. The world had become a minefield of mundane objects. He could feel the Fragile status humming in his bones, a constant, low-frequency reminder that he was essentially made of fine china.

"I can't fight that thing!" Artie yelled, backing away as the slime hopped again. Schlorp. It was closer now. He could see the bits of undigested twigs floating inside its translucent gut. "I don't even have a sword! I have a rewards card for a sandwich shop and a set of house keys!"

"Then use your keys!" Fizz suggested, hovering just out of reach. "You have a hundred percent crit rate, Artie. You could probably kill a god with a toothpick if you timed it right. Of course, the god would only have to sneeze on you to win, but that’s the 'Quit' part of the title."

The slime hopped again, and this time, it was close enough that Artie could smell it—a cloying, sweet scent like rotting peaches. It wasn't just a blob; it was a predator. Its surface tension rippled as it prepared for a larger leap.

Artie backed up further, his heart hammering against his chest so hard he was afraid it would count as internal damage. His heel hit something solid. He glanced back.

A massive, ancient oak tree blocked his path. Its roots were gnarled and thick, twisting out of the earth like petrified snakes. He was cornered. 

The slime sensed it. It stopped five feet away, its body pulsing, glowing with a faint, sickly green light as it drew in air to launch itself at his face.

"Okay, Penhaligon," Artie muttered to himself, his breath coming in shallow, ragged gasps. "Think. You're a spreadsheet guy. You're a data analyst. This is just a hostile merger. With a giant grape."

He reached into his right pocket and gripped his Keyring. He pulled it out, the metal jingling with a sound that felt like a funeral bell. He didn't have a shield. He didn't have armor. He had a 100% chance to do something spectacular, and a 100% chance to die if he messed it up.

Artie dropped into a low, desperate crouch, his back pressed against the rough bark of the tree. He held the keys out in his right hand like a dinky, silver dagger, his knuckles white. 

"Come on, then," he snarled at the vibrating puddle of goo. "Let's see if the math holds up."

The slime compressed itself into a flat pancake, then launched.
