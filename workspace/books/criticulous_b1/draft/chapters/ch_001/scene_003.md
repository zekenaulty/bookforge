The transition from the absolute white of the System Void to the neon-green saturation of the Slime Fields felt like being slapped in the face with a wet, radioactive towel. Artie Penhaligon stumbled, his loafers skidding on grass that was a little too springy to be natural. He instinctively reached up to steady the Corporate ID Badge hanging from his neck. The plastic clicked against his chest, a comforting, mundane sound in a world that had abandoned the concept of "normal" three minutes ago.

"Welcome to the Tutorial Zone, User 001-ALPHA!" Fizz chirped, her tiny, glowing blue form zipping around Artie’s head like a caffeinated firefly. She left a trail of pixelated dust that smelled faintly of ozone and blueberry muffins. "Or as I like to call it: The Place Where Math Meets the Meat-Grinder. Isn't it picturesque?"

Artie squinted. The sky was a shade of cyan that suggested the atmosphere was made of Gatorade. In the distance, rolling hills of vibrant turf were dotted with trees that looked like they’d been copy-pasted by a developer who was five minutes away from a weekend bender.

"It’s... bright," Artie said, his voice raspy. He patted his sides, feeling the reassuring bulk of his Smartphone in his left pocket and his Leather Wallet in his right. He was still wearing his office attire—a rumpled button-down that now bore the scorched, jagged patterns of his untimely demise. The severe electrical burns on his chest throbbed with a dull, phantom heat, a reminder that he was technically a dead man walking.

[Warning: Reality Stability is currently at 95%. Expect minor graphical artifacts.]

"Picturesque isn't the word I'd use," Artie muttered, looking down at his hands. He could see the faint keyboard callus on his right palm. "So, what’s the plan? I kill a few things, I get some levels, I find a way to stop being a walking heart-attack risk?"

Fizz landed on his shoulder, her weightless presence barely registering. "About that! Since you decided to play 'Optimal Spreadsheet' with your life, we should probably check your status. Just so you know exactly how much of a gentle breeze it’ll take to delete you."

Artie sighed and mentally willed the screen into existence.

[Name: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[Title: Crit or Quit]
[Level: 1]
[HP: 1/1]
[Crit Rate: 100%]
[Status: Glass Soul (Permanent)]

[Glass Soul: Your spirit is as sharp as a diamond and just as fragile. HP is locked at 1. All incoming damage—including environmental, status-based, or stubbed toes—is fatal. On the bright side, you’ll never have to worry about hospital bills.]

"One," Artie whispered, the word feeling heavy in his mouth. "I have one hit point. Fizz, I’ve had hangovers with more durability than this."

"Hey, you're the one who dumped sixty points into Critical Hit Rate!" Fizz reminded him, doing a somersault in the air. "You're a statistical god, Artie. You just happen to be a god made of wet tissue paper. Look! Your first fan is approaching."

Artie looked up. Emerging from behind a particularly blocky bush was a wobbling mound of translucent green jelly. It was about the size of a beach ball, with two vacant, black-dot eyes and a rhythmic pulse that made it look like a giant, sentient booger.

[Lesser Green Slime - Lvl 1]
[HP: 10/10]
[Status: Hungry]

The slime didn't roar. It made a sound like a plunger being pulled out of a sink. Schlorp. It began to undulate toward Artie, leaving a glistening trail of slime on the grass.

"Okay," Artie said, backing up a step. "It’s a slime. It’s a Level One slime. In every game I’ve ever played, these things are basically experience-point pinatas. I can handle this."

"Normally, yes," Fizz said, her voice dropping into a tone of mock-seriousness. "Normally, a Level One player can take about five or six hits from a Lesser Green Slime before they need a potion. But you? Artie, if that thing so much as sneezes in your general direction, you’re going back to the vending machine in the sky."

The slime accelerated. It wasn't fast, but it was persistent. It launched itself forward in a small hop, landing with a wet thud a few feet closer.

Artie felt a cold sweat break out on his neck. He looked around for a weapon—a stick, a rock, anything—but the Slime Fields were suspiciously well-manicured. 

"Wait, if I have a hundred percent crit rate, I just need to hit it once, right?" Artie asked, his heart hammering against his ribs.

"Technically, yes! But you have zero Strength, Artie. You're a 'slender' build with the physical power of a damp noodle. Your crits will multiply your damage, but ten times zero is still zero. You need to find a way to actually... you know... damage it."

The slime hopped again. This time, it cleared three feet. It was close enough now that Artie could smell it—a cloying, sugary scent like lime Jell-O left in the sun.

"Fizz, it's looking at me," Artie said, his voice rising an octave. "Why is it looking at me like that?"

"Because you're a Level One Anomaly and you look delicious! Also, you're standing in its path. Move, Artie! Use those legs!"

Artie scrambled backward, but his heel caught on a tuft of the springy grass. He flailed, his arms windmilling as he fought to keep his balance. His Corporate ID Badge swung wildly on its lanyard. He managed to stay upright, but the slime was now only five feet away. It paused, its body quivering as it prepared for a larger leap.

[Combat Log: Lesser Green Slime is charging 'Tutorial Bounce'!]

"Charging?" Artie yelled. "Since when do slimes charge?"

"Since you entered the world on 'Hardcore Mode'!" Fizz shouted back, retreating to a safe distance in the air. "Artie, listen to me. The Glass Soul isn't just a debuff. It’s a reality. You cannot be touched. Not by the slime, not by the grass if it’s too sharp, not by me if I accidentally glitch through you. You are a one-hit-point wonder. Act like it!"

The slime launched. 

It was a slow-motion nightmare. The green mass expanded as it flew through the air, its translucent body catching the Gatorade-blue sunlight. Artie dived to the right, feeling the rush of air as the slime sailed past his ear. He hit the ground hard, the impact jarring his bones.

[HP: 1/1]
[Warning: Impact registered. Durability check passed. Barely.]

Artie scrambled to his feet, his breath coming in ragged gasps. He looked at the slime, which had landed and was already turning around with a wet, squelching sound. It seemed faster now. More focused. 

"I can't do this," Artie panted, his eyes darting around the field. "I'm an accountant, Fizz! I track losses, I don't experience them personally!"

"Well, start accounting for your life, because here it comes again!"

The slime didn't hop this time. It began to stretch, its body elongating until it looked like a green serpent. It lashed out, a whip-like appendage of jelly snapping toward Artie’s ankles. Artie jumped—a clumsy, desperate hop—and the slime-whip whistled beneath his feet.

He landed in a patch of mud, his loafers sinking into the muck. He was cornered against a large, blocky rock that looked like it had been rendered with a low polygon count. The slime sensed his hesitation. It stopped lashing and began to expand, growing larger and larger as it pulled more mass from its own center. It was preparing for a full-body slam.

Artie backed up until his spine hit the cold, hard surface of the rock. He looked at the slime, then at his own trembling hands. He had no weapon. He had no armor. He had a Corporate ID Badge, a Smartphone, and a Leather Wallet. 

[Lesser Green Slime - Lvl 1]
[Status: Aggroed]
[Action: Tutorial Slam in 3... 2...]

"Fizz!" Artie screamed. "Advice! Now!"

"Don't get hit!" she yelled back, her blue glow flickering with excitement. "And maybe try to find the 'Crit' in 'Crit or Quit' before you become a floor stain!"

The slime launched itself, a wall of green jelly filling Artie’s vision. He realized, with a clarity that only comes to the terminally doomed, that this was it. One touch, and the game was over before the tutorial even finished.
