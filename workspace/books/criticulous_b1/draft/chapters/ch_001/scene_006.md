The wet, rhythmic *thwip-slap* of ten thousand gelatinous bodies hitting the dirt was a sound Artie Penhaligon hoped to never hear again as long as he lived—which, given his current health pool, was likely to be about another thirty seconds if he didn't pick up the pace. 

His lungs were screaming. Not the metaphorical "I should have done more cardio" scream, but a jagged, white-hot agony that felt like he was inhaling ground glass. Every time his feet hit the packed earth of the trail, a little yellow bar in the corner of his vision flickered and dipped.

"Faster, Artie! They're gaining! And they look hungry! Or, well, they look like they want to absorb you into their collective mass, which is basically the same thing for a guy with one hit point!" Fizz was zipping around his head, her neon blue hair trailing pixelated sparks like a faulty firework. 

"I'm... trying!" Artie wheezed. He tightened his grip on the Participation Trophy. The gold-plated plastic felt cheap and oily in his right hand, pulsing with a rhythmic, sickly green light that seemed to act as a homing beacon for every slime within a three-mile radius. In his left hand, he clutched the strap of his lanyard, the Corporate ID Badge flapping against his chest like a frantic, plastic heart.

"Can't I... just drop it?" Artie gasped, his boots skidding on a patch of loose gravel.

"Soul-bound, remember?" Fizz chirped, doing a celebratory loop-de-loop. "The System loves a winner, and you won the 'Most Likely to Break the Physics Engine' award! You and that trophy are best friends forever. Or until you die. Which, again, looking at that stamina bar..."

[Stamina: 8/100]
(Warning: Critical Exhaustion Imminent)

The horizon finally offered a reprieve: the towering, timber-and-stone walls of Oakhaven. Two massive oak gates stood open, flanked by guards in gleaming plate mail who looked significantly more competent than the slimes. 

Artie didn't stop. He couldn't. If he stopped, the momentum of his own panic would probably tip him over, and with a Max HP of 1, the impact with the ground might actually count as a finishing blow. 

"Help!" he croaked, stumbling toward the threshold. 

The guards didn't draw their swords. Instead, they stepped back, one of them raising a hand toward a floating crystal embedded in the archway. "Whoa, whoa! Slow down, Traveler! State your business and—holy mother of RNG, look at the trail on that one!"

Artie collapsed just past the threshold, his knees hitting the cobblestones with a jarring thud. He skidded a few feet, the Participation Trophy clattering against the stones but remaining firmly in his grasp. Behind him, at the edge of the 'Safe Zone' line, the sea of slimes hit an invisible wall and began to pile up, a roiling wall of translucent green spite.

[Status: Safe Zone Entered. Aggro Reset.]

Artie rolled onto his back, staring up at the sky. His mousy brown hair was matted with sweat, and his hazel eyes were wide with the kind of shell-shocked stare usually reserved for middle managers during a surprise fiscal audit. The severe electrical burns on his chest, a permanent souvenir from the vending machine that had sent him here, throbbed in time with his racing heart.

"I made it," he whispered. "I'm alive."

"For now," Fizz said, landing on his nose. "But you might want to look up. The welcoming committee looks... confused."

Artie blinked. The two guards were standing over him, but they weren't looking at him. They were looking at a translucent blue pane of light that had projected itself from the gate's crystal.

"Is the scanner broken?" the first guard asked, poking the air. 

"Shouldn't be," the second replied, squinting. "But look at these readings. It’s saying he’s Level 3, but his durability rating is... zero? No, wait. It says 'N/A'. And his luck stat is just a series of question marks."

The crystal above the gate began to hum, shifting from a calm blue to a strobing, agitated violet. 

[System Notification: Security Scan in Progress...]
[Target: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[Analyzing Statistical Variance...]

"Hey, what's that thing doing?" Artie asked, trying to push himself up. He felt for his Smartphone in his left pocket and his Leather Wallet in his right, a reflexive check for his mundane belongings. They were still there, small comforts in a world that was currently trying to calculate his existence.

"It's the Gatekeeper Scan," Fizz explained, her voice losing its playful edge. "It checks for gear level, stat alignment, and—"

The humming reached a crescendo. A giant, red box materialized in the air above Artie's head, pulsing with the intensity of a dying sun.

[CRITICAL ERROR: STATISTICAL ANOMALY DETECTED]
[Variance Threshold Exceeded: 99.99%]
[Build Identity: 'Crit or Quit']
[Status: Flagged for Administrative Review]

The guards moved then, their spears leveling at Artie's chest. "Nobody moves! We’ve got a glitcher!"

Artie looked from the spears to the red box, then at the glowing Participation Trophy in his hand. "I can explain," he said, his voice cracking. "It was the vending machine's fault."
