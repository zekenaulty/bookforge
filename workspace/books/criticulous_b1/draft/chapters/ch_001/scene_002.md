The white void was less of a room and more of a conceptual error. Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stood in the center of the nothingness, looking down at his new attire. The sensible, charcoal-grey slacks of a Senior Logistics Analyst were gone, replaced by a simple Linen Tunic that was surprisingly soft but offered the structural integrity of a wet paper towel. 

He shifted the weight of the Broken Tutorial Sword in his right hand. It was a jagged, rusted length of iron that felt less like a weapon and more like a tetanus shot waiting to happen. In his pocket, a single copper coin clinked—his entire net worth in this new, absurd reality.

"I’m going to need to see a manager," Artie said to the emptiness. "Or at least a technician. I’m fairly certain my death was a result of faulty wiring in the Snack-O-Matic 3000, which constitutes a gross violation of workplace safety standards."

"Actually, it constitutes a gross violation of common sense," a voice chirped from behind him.

Artie spun around, his sandals slapping against the invisible floor. A girl—or a very convincing holographic approximation of one—was hovering a few feet away. She was draped in a cloak of shimmering, translucent code, and her eyes were literal glowing asterisks that flickered as she scrolled through a translucent Data Slate held in her left hand.

"I’m Fizz," she said, her tone dripping with the kind of boredom usually reserved for DMV employees. "Your System Liaison. I’m here to make sure you don't immediately delete yourself, though looking at your file, that might be an uphill battle. Arthur Penhaligon, right? The guy who lost a wrestling match with a vending machine?"

"It was a draw," Artie corrected, lifting his chin. "The machine is also dead. I took it down with me."

Fizz snorted, tapping her Data Slate. "Let's see what the official record says." She flicked her wrist, and a window manifested in the air between them.

[System Notification: Death Report]
[Subject: Penhaligon, Arthur]
[Cause of Death: Kinetic-Electrical Feedback Loop (Vending Machine Malfunction)]
[Final Words: 'I paid for the Habanero Hoops, you bucket of bolts!']
[Status: Isekai-Eligible (Pity Tier)]

"Pity tier?" Artie echoed, his face reddening. "I had a spreadsheet for my spreadsheets, Fizz. I was the king of optimization. I could find a three-percent margin in a desert."

"Great," Fizz said, waving the report away. "Then you’ll love this. It’s time for character creation. You have fifty points to spend. Try not to put them all into 'Whining,' it’s a hidden stat and the scaling is terrible."

A massive blue UI panel shimmered into existence.

[Character Creation: Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon]
[Class: Unassigned]
[Level: 1]

[Attributes]
[Strength: 5] (+) (-)
[Agility: 5] (+) (-)
[Intelligence: 5] (+) (-)
[Vitality: 5] (+) (-)
[Luck: 5] (+) (-)

[Available Points: 50]

Artie stared at the numbers. "Five? That’s it? That’s the baseline for a human being?"

"It’s the 'Standard Mediocrity' package," Fizz said, leaning back in the air as if it were a recliner. "Most people put their points into Vitality. You know, so they don't die when a slime sneezes on them. But hey, you’re the optimization guy. Go nuts."

Artie didn't look at Vitality. He was scrolling through the sub-menus, his eyes darting across the fine print of the System’s logic. He found a tab labeled [Variance & Probability]. Inside was a single, golden slider: **Critical Hit Affinity.**

"Fizz," Artie said, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "What’s the exchange rate on Luck?"

"Luck?" Fizz glanced over, her asterisk-eyes narrowing. "It’s a trap stat. One point of Luck costs five Attribute Points. It governs your 'Critical' outcomes. If you max it, you’ll hit like a truck, but you’ll have the durability of a soap bubble. The System balances the math, Artie. You can't have high variance and high stability."

Artie looked at the Broken Tutorial Sword. He thought about the vending machine—how he’d shaken it and shaken it, and it hadn't budged until the surge hit. He didn't want stability. He wanted the surge.

"If I never get hit," Artie mused, "I don't need health. And if every hit is a Critical Hit, I don't need Strength."

"Artie, don't," Fizz said, her boredom finally giving way to a flicker of alarm.

Artie’s finger blurred. He didn't just spend his fifty points; he began hitting the minus signs on his other stats. He drained his Strength to one. He drained his Agility, his Intelligence, and finally, his Vitality. The points flooded into the Luck slider, pushing it higher and higher until the UI began to pulse with a frantic, red light.

[WARNING: Stat Imbalance Detected]
[WARNING: Vitality dropping below Recommended Minimum (10)]
[WARNING: Physical Integrity at Risk]

"You’re going to spawn in as a ghost!" Fizz shouted, reaching for the screen. "Stop!"

Artie’s finger hovered over the final confirmation. "Optimization, Fizz. It’s all about the margins."

He slammed his hand against the [CONFIRM] button.

The white void didn't just groan; it shrieked. A pillar of golden light erupted from the menu, engulfing Artie. He felt his very essence being stretched thin, his physical form becoming light and airy, as if he were made of nothing but potential and math.

[System Notification: Build Confirmed]
[New Title Acquired: Statistical Anomaly]
[New Title Acquired: The Glassest Cannon]

[Final Attributes]

The light faded. Artie stood there, feeling... fragile. He looked at his hands; they were slightly translucent, the white void visible through his palms. He gripped the Broken Tutorial Sword, and a faint, golden hum vibrated through the hilt.

Fizz stared at him, her Data Slate frozen in mid-air. "One," she whispered. "You have one hit point, Artie. If you stub your toe, you’re going to explode. If a bird poops on you, it’s a Game Over. You are literally the most fragile thing in the history of the multiverse."

Artie smiled, though even the effort of smiling felt like it might cost him half his stamina. "But did you see the multiplier, Fizz? Five hundred percent. Every time I swing this rusted piece of junk, it’s going to hit with the force of a falling moon."

"Assuming you survive the swing," Fizz muttered, her fingers flying across her slate as she tried to recalibrate her sensors. "Fine. You want to play the 'Crit or Quit' game? Let’s see how long you last. Initiating deployment to Tutorial Zone: The Whispering Woods."

"Wait, already?" Artie asked, his knees wobbling slightly from his lack of Strength.

"The System doesn't like anomalies," Fizz said, her image beginning to flicker. "It wants to 'resolve' you as quickly as possible. Good luck, Artie. I’ll start drafting your next obituary."

The white void began to dissolve, the floor falling away into a swirling vortex of green and brown. Artie clutched his broken sword and his single copper coin, bracing himself as the world rushed up to meet him.
