The Lesser Forest Slime didn’t have a face, but it definitely had an attitude. It jiggled with a predatory rhythm, its translucent green mass pulsing like a neon stress ball filled with spite. 

[Lesser Forest Slime - Lvl 1] [HP: 10/10]

Artie backed up until the rough, gnarled bark of the ancient oak tree bit into his shoulder blades. His heart was doing a frantic drum solo against his ribs, a reminder that his current HP was exactly one. If a stray breeze carried too much pollen, he was reasonably certain the System would categorize it as a lethal status effect.

"Okay, Artie. Think. It’s just physics and bad programming," he muttered, his fingers white-knuckled around the metal loop of his Keyring. The Honda Civic keys dangled like the world’s saddest flail. "I have a hundred percent crit rate. I just need to touch it. One tap, and the math does the rest."

The slime lunged. It didn’t crawl; it launched itself like a glob of radioactive snot. Artie swung the keys with a desperate, uncoordinated yelp.

[Miss!]

The slime flattened itself against the grass, the metal teeth of the house keys whistling through the empty air where its "head" had been a microsecond before. Artie stumbled, his lack of coordination sending him teetering toward the very thing that wanted to dissolve his shins.

"Right. Agility of a sedentary potato. Noted," he wheezed, scrambling to reset his stance.

The creature recoiled, its gelatinous body shivering as it prepared for a second pass. It looked like it was laughing at him. Artie didn't blame it; he was a grown man in a business-casual button-down trying to fight a puddle with a grocery store loyalty card.

It hopped again. He swung low this time, aiming for the base.

[Miss!]

The slime performed a graceful, mid-air pirouette. It sailed over his hand, landing with a wet thwack just inches from his left shoe. Artie jumped back, nearly tripping over a protruding root.

[Warning: HP 1/1. Any contact will result in immediate character deletion.]

"I know! I'm working on it!" Artie shouted at the floating red text. 

He tried a tactical thrust. It was a move he’d seen in a dozen movies, a sharp jab intended to puncture. 

[Miss!]

The slime didn't even move this time. It just shifted. A hole opened up in the center of its mass, and Artie's hand passed straight through the gap. The metal keys clattered against each other, ringing out in the quiet woods like a dinner bell for his own funeral. He yanked his arm back before the hole could close around his wrist.

"Three misses," he panted. "The RNG gods aren't even spitting on me. They’re just ignoring my existence."

The slime was getting bolder. It began to circle him, its green surface darkening. It was charging up. Artie could see the internal pressure building, the slime becoming more opaque as it prepared a high-velocity strike. He lunged forward, trying to catch it off-balance.

[Miss!]

His foot slipped on a patch of damp moss. Instead of a heroic strike, he performed a rhythmic flail that ended with him hugging the ancient oak tree for dear life. The slime didn't even have to dodge; he’d missed by a solid three feet.

"This is it," Artie whispered, watching the slime coil itself into a tight, vibrating spring. "I’m going to be the first person in history to be killed by a Level 1 tutorial mob while having a literal cheat-code build."

The slime launched. It was a green blur, a projectile of pure aggression. Artie didn't think. He didn't aim. He just closed his eyes and swung his right hand in a wide, panicked arc, the Keyring trailing behind like a comet of silver and plastic.

[Miss!]

The keys hit the air. The slime sailed past his ear. He felt the rush of wind, the cold sensation of death missing him by a fraction of an inch. That was five. Five misses. He was a statistical impossibility of failure.

But as he swung, his momentum carried him around. He was spinning, a human top of pure incompetence. His hand, still clutching the keys, slammed into the trunk of the ancient oak tree. Except, it didn't just hit the tree. The edge of his thumb—just a tiny sliver of skin—brushed against the trailing edge of the slime as it tried to recover from its leap.

The world turned white.

[SYSTEM ALERT: CRITICAL HIT!]
[CALCULATING DAMAGE...]
[ERROR: CRIT RATE 100% DETECTED]
[ERROR: NESTED MULTIPLIER DETECTED]
[ERROR: MATH.EXE HAS ENCOUNTERED A PROBLEM]
[SUPER-MEGA-ULTRA-CRIT!]

A sound like a thunderclap inside a library shattered the silence of the Whispering Woods. A pillar of pure, incandescent light erupted from the point of contact. It wasn't just a hit; it was a localized apocalypse. Artie felt a shockwave ripple through his arm, but it didn't hurt. It felt like static, as if his entire body was being recalculated in real-time. 

When the light faded, the slime was gone. It wasn't dead; it was deleted. There wasn't even a stain on the grass. 

But it wasn't just the slime. The ancient oak tree—the massive, multi-ton landmark Artie had been cornered against—was gone. In its place was a perfectly circular, cauterized crater that extended twenty feet into the forest floor. The upper branches of the neighboring trees were smoldering, their leaves turned to ash by the sheer thermal output of a single, accidental punch.

Artie stood there, his hand still extended, clutching a Keyring that was now glowing with a faint, dying ember of blue light.

[Stat Points Awarded: 5]

Artie stared at the crater. Then he looked at his keys. The plastic fob for his local gym had melted into a shapeless blob, but the keys themselves were fine. 

"Well," he said, his voice cracking. "At least I don't have to worry about the tree anymore."

He checked his status window. The '1/1' next to his HP was still there, mocking him in bright, neon red. Level 2 didn't change the fact that a stiff breeze could end his journey, but it did mean the System was officially tracking his carnage.

"Fizz?" he called out, looking around the smoking ruin of the tutorial zone. "I think I broke the woods."

There was no answer, just the sound of falling ash and the distant, confused chirping of birds that had somehow survived the math-based explosion. He looked down at his hand. His thumb was fine. Not a scratch. The 100% Crit Rate hadn't just made him powerful; it had turned him into a walking glitch.

[Title Progress: Anomaly - 1%]

"Great," he muttered, wiping soot off his shirt. "I'm not a hero. I'm a bug report."
