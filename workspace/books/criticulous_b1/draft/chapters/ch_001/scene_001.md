The fluorescent light in the breakroom hummed with the frequency of a migraine that had finally achieved sentience. It flickered, a rhythmic strobe that turned the beige walls and the crusty microwave into a low-budget horror set. Arthur Penhaligon—Artie to the three people who didn't call him 'Hey, You'—stared at the Snack-O-Matic 3000 with the intensity of a man contemplating regicide.

Behind the scratched plexiglass, a single bag of 'Nacho Average Jalapeño' chips dangled by a literal plastic hair. The metal coil had completed its rotation, but the bag had defied the laws of gravity, physics, and basic human decency. It hung there, mocking him, a buck-fifty investment suspended in a bureaucratic limbo that mirrored Artie’s entire existence.

"Are you kidding me?" Artie muttered. His voice was raspy from eight hours of explaining to Mrs. Gable why her internet didn't work when she unplugged the router to vacuum. "It’s a bag of chips. It’s air and corn dust. Just fall."

He shifted his weight, and the weight of his cargo shifted with him. In his right hand, Artie gripped the hilt of a 'Rusty Shortsword.' It wasn't actually metal, or at least not the kind that could hold an edge. It was high-density foam coated in a realistic, weathered latex, a prop for the 'Kingdoms of Kaladar' LARP event he was supposed to be driving to the moment his shift ended. His manager, a man whose personality was best described as 'lukewarm mayonnaise,' had already given him a thirty-minute lecture about 'professionalism in the workspace' when he’d seen the sword leaning against Artie's cubicle. 

Artie hadn't cared. He didn't care about the spreadsheets, the 'synergy' meetings, or the way the office coffee tasted like a blend of charcoal and despair. He only cared about getting to the woods, putting on his tabard, and pretending, for forty-eight hours, that he wasn't a cog in a machine that was desperately in need of oil.

But now, the machine was winning.

"E-4," Artie whispered, his finger hovering over the keypad. "I paid for E-4."

He looked down at his right hand. The foam sword felt absurd in the sterile light of the breakroom, but it was the only thing he owned that felt real. His smartphone was a dead brick in his pocket, its battery drained by a day of scrolling through forums to avoid looking at his inbox. His wallet was equally light, containing exactly three dollars—half of which was currently tied up in the Jalapeño hostage situation.

He reached out with his left hand and gave the vending machine a tentative shove. The Snack-O-Matic 3000 didn't budge. It was a heavy, industrial beast, bolted to the floor as if the company feared someone might actually try to steal the stale granola bars.

"Come on, you bucket of bolts. Work with me."

Artie leaned his shoulder into the machine, his right hand still white-knuckled around the LARP sword. He could see his reflection in the plexiglass: a man in his late twenties with dark circles under his eyes and a haircut that screamed 'I gave up in 2019.' He looked like a background character in a movie about a guy who has a much more interesting life.

He gave the machine a harder shake. This time, the coil rattled. The bag of chips swayed. For a glorious second, it looked like it might drop. Then, it settled back into its precarious perch, more stuck than before.

"That’s it," Artie snapped. The last thread of his patience, frayed by a thousand 'per my last email's, finally snapped. "I am not losing a dollar-fifty to a machine that hasn't been cleaned since the Clinton administration."

He dropped into a crouch, peering into the delivery bin at the bottom. The flap was heavy plastic, spring-loaded to prevent 'theft.' Artie knew the legend: if you reached up far enough, you could sometimes jar the coils. It was a move born of desperation and hunger, a low-level exploit in the game of office survival.

He shoved his left arm into the bin, the plastic teeth of the flap biting into his forearm. He reached upward, his fingers straining toward the dangling chips. 

"Just... one... nudge..."

His right hand, the one holding the Rusty Shortsword, braced against the side of the machine for leverage. He didn't notice the frayed power cord snaking out from the back of the Snack-O-Matic, where the insulation had been rubbed raw by years of being shoved against the wall. He didn't see the small pool of water from the leaking industrial fridge nearby that had crept toward the machine's base.

As Artie lunged upward, trying to hook the bag with his fingernails, his sword—specifically the metallic-painted crossguard which, unknown to Artie, contained a very real, very conductive steel core for structural integrity—slid into a gap in the machine’s metal casing.

The world didn't end with a bang. It ended with a *hum*.

A massive, bone-shaking vibration surged up Artie’s right arm. It wasn't just a shock; it was a hostile takeover. His muscles clamped shut, his hand fusing to the hilt of the sword, which was now acting as a perfect bridge between the building's faulty wiring and his own nervous system. 

Blue sparks danced across the plexiglass, illuminating the 'Nacho Average Jalapeño' chips in a ghostly, electric glow. Artie tried to scream, but his jaw was locked in a grimace of pure, unadulterated agony. His vision began to pixelate. Not in the metaphorical sense—literal squares of color began to drop out of his field of vision, replaced by a flat, void-like black.

*Seriously?* he thought, the last coherent spark of his mind flickering with typical snark. *Killed by a vending machine? This is the most Artie way to go.*

The smell of ozone and burning polyester filled the air. The humming grew louder, reaching a crescendo that sounded suspiciously like a dial-up modem trying to connect to the afterlife. 

Then, the chips fell. 

The bag hit the bottom of the bin with a soft *thud* that Artie didn't hear.

The world went dark. The hum faded into a profound, ringing silence.

Artie felt... nothing. No pain, no floor beneath his feet, no weight of the sword in his hand. He was suspended in a place that wasn't a place, a vast expanse of nothingness that felt strangely like a computer screen before the BIOS loads.

A single line of text appeared in the center of the void. It was neon green and pulsed with a steady, digital heartbeat.

[Initializing... System Version 4.02.b]

"Oh, you've got to be kidding me," Artie said. Or thought. He wasn't sure if he had a mouth anymore. "I’m in a LitRPG? I died for a bag of chips and now I’m a protagonist?"

[Welcome, User: Arthur Penhaligon.]

Another line of text appeared, this one a bright, aggressive red.

[Warning: Your previous existence has been terminated due to: 'Stupidity-Induced Electrical Discharge.']

"Hey! It was a dollar-fifty!" Artie shouted into the dark.

[System Note: Wow. You really had nothing going for you, did you?]

The text began to scroll faster now, a blur of stats and calculations that Artie couldn't keep up with. He felt a strange tugging sensation, as if his very essence was being compressed into a zip file.

[Please wait while we determine your starting stats based on your final moments of 'High-Stakes Combat' with the Snack-O-Matic 3000.]

"High-stakes combat?" Artie muttered. "I was just hungry."

[Stat Allocation in Progress...]

The darkness began to thin, replaced by a blinding white light that smelled of fresh plastic and new-car scent. Artie felt the familiar weight of the sword return to his hand, but it felt different now. Heavier. Real.

The System’s voice—if a text box could have a voice—sounded distinctly smug.

[Welcome to the RNG-Hellscape, Artie. Let's see if you can survive the tutorial.]
