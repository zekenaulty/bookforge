The Zesty Ranch Zings hung by a literal thread—a plastic coil that had decided to stop rotating exactly three millimeters short of a successful delivery. Arthur Penhaligon stared at the bag, his reflection in the vending machine’s scratched plexiglass looking back with the hollowed-out eyes of a man who had spent eight hours auditing spreadsheets for a company that sold industrial-grade adhesives.

[Patience: 5/100]

"You’ve got to be kidding me," Artie muttered. His voice sounded thin in the empty breakroom, competing with the low-frequency hum of a refrigerator that had been dying since the late nineties. 

He looked down at the Smartphone in his right hand. The screen flickered to life: 4:58 PM. Two minutes. He had two minutes left on the clock before he could legally flee this fluorescent purgatory, and the only thing standing between him and a dignified commute was a seventy-five-cent bag of corn-based disappointment. 

Artie tapped his thumb against the glass of the phone. His current build—if one could call a thirty-two-year-old accountant a 'build'—was heavily specced into [Cynicism] and [Procrastination]. It wasn't a winning meta.

[Skill Check: Cynicism (Level 3) – Success!]
[Observation: The vending machine isn't broken; it's malicious. It knows you’re at your breaking point. It feeds on the tears of the underpaid.]

"I know," he whispered to the empty room. "I know."

He tightened his grip on the Smartphone. It was his only connection to a world that didn't smell like burnt coffee and despair. He reached into his left pocket with his free hand, fingers brushing against the cool, cracked surface of his Leather Wallet. He didn't need more money; he’d already paid. The machine’s digital display was mocking him with a steady, unblinking '0.00'.

Artie leaned his forehead against the cool plexiglass. "Listen, you oversized toaster. I’ve had a day. Brenda from HR asked me to 'circle back' on a memo six times. My car is making a sound like a cat in a blender. Just give me the Zings."

The machine didn't respond. It just hummed, a steady, vibrating drone that Artie felt in his teeth. 

[Patience: 2/100]

This was the boss fight of his mundane existence. The Breakroom Golem. Its armor was made of reinforced steel and bad luck. Its loot table was exclusively snacks that expired during the previous administration. And right now, it was winning.

Artie shifted his weight, the Keyring in his right pocket jingling as he prepared for a tactical maneuver. In the world of corporate survival, this was known as 'Percussive Maintenance.' To anyone else, it was just kicking the crap out of a machine.

He checked his stats. 

[HP: 100/100]
[Status: Disgruntled Employee]

He was at full health, but his mental resources were tapped. Artie took a deep breath, ensured the Smartphone was secure in his right hand, and delivered a measured, frustrated kick to the base of the machine.

*Thud.*

The bag of Zings didn't even quiver. If anything, it seemed to settle deeper into the coil, nestling in for a long winter’s nap.

"Oh, so that’s how it’s going to be?" Artie snarled. 

[Patience: 0/100]

He grabbed the sides of the machine. It was heavy, weighted down by the collective misery of the accounting department. He began to shake it. The hum from the machine changed pitch—a rising, angry whine that sounded less like a cooling fan and more like a jet engine preparing for takeoff.

"Give! Me! My! Chips!"

He gave it one final, desperate heave. 

Inside the machine, something snapped. Not the plastic coil—that stayed perfectly still. No, the sound came from the back, a sharp, electric crack that echoed like a gunshot in the small room. A blue arc of light danced behind the rows of chocolate bars, illuminating the interior with a hellish, flickering glow.

[Warning: Environmental Hazard Detected!]
[System Note: Maybe stop touching the high-voltage equipment, Artie?]

"I don't care about the hazard! I want my—"

The machine didn't just short-circuit. It exhaled. 

A surge of raw, unbridled electricity surged through the metal frame, jumping the gap between the chassis and Artie's sweat-slicked palms. The world didn't go black immediately. First, it went white. A blinding, searing neon white that turned his skeleton into a silhouette.

[Critical Hit! -100 HP]

The pain was brief, mostly because his nerves didn't have time to process the fact that they were being cooked. He felt a strange sensation of weightlessness, followed by the distinct sound of his Smartphone hitting the linoleum floor with a pathetic clack. 

His Leather Wallet felt heavy in his pocket for one last second before the sensation of 'having a body' became a legacy feature he no longer supported.

[HP: 0/100]
[Status: Deceased]

"Well," Artie thought, the last spark of his consciousness flickering like a dying lightbulb. "At least I don't have to circle back with Brenda."

The breakroom faded. The smell of ozone and Zesty Ranch Zings vanished. The floor, the ceiling, and the crushing weight of his thirty-year mortgage dissolved into a vast, shimmering void of darkness. 

He wasn't standing. He wasn't sitting. He just was. 

And then, a window appeared. Not a window made of glass, but a floating, translucent box of light that pulsed with a soft, rhythmic glow.
