The spiral coil of the Snack-Master 4000 groaned, a sound like a rusted gate in a horror movie, and then stopped. It didn’t just stop; it mocked. The bag of Zesty Ranch Glitch-O’s dangled by a single, microscopic corner of plastic, suspended over the precipice of the delivery chute. 

Arthur 'Artie' Penhaligon stared through the smudged glass, his reflection staring back with the hollow, haunted eyes of a man who had spent the last six hours staring at Excel spreadsheets that refused to balance. His mousy brown hair, usually just "unruly," had reached a state of chaotic defiance, sticking out in tufts that mirrored his internal state. He was a Junior Analyst, a title that sounded professional but mostly meant he was the person people blamed when the coffee ran out.

The Leather Wallet felt heavy in his right hand, a useless slab of cowhide that had just surrendered four dollars for a snack it refused to surrender. Artie looked down at the Leather Wallet, then back at the chips. 

"You've got to be kidding me," Artie muttered. His voice was raspy, the product of too much recycled office air and not enough social interaction. 

He adjusted the Corporate ID Badge hanging from his neck. The plastic lanyard was frayed, the clip digging into his collarbone. The photo on the badge showed a younger, more optimistic Artie, one who hadn't yet realized that "upward mobility" was a myth designed to keep people from jumping out of the third-story windows. 

In his right pocket, his Cracked Smartphone buzzed. Probably another notification from the project manager asking if the Q3 projections were ready. Artie ignored it. The projections weren't ready. The projections would never be ready. The only thing that mattered right now was the bag of chips.

Artie leaned his forehead against the cool glass of the machine. He could see the faint outline of a vending machine scar on his right knuckle, a jagged little reminder of the Great Snickers Standoff of last winter. He had won that fight. He would win this one.

"Listen, you overpriced box of scrap," he whispered. "I’ve had a very long day. My boss told me my 'synergy' was lacking. My car made a noise this morning that sounded like a cat in a blender. And I just want my Glitch-O's."

The machine didn't respond. It just hummed, a low-frequency vibration that seemed to vibrate his very teeth. 

Artie’s patience, a resource that had been dwindling since he’d clocked in at 8:00 AM, finally hit rock bottom. He wasn't just a Junior Analyst anymore. He was a man with a grievance. He was a man who had been pushed too far by a piece of automated retail equipment.

He shifted the Leather Wallet to his left hand and balled his right hand into a fist. He aimed for the sweet spot—the area just to the left of the keypad where the internal sensors lived. It was a move he called "Percussive Maintenance," a skill he had leveled up through years of dealing with subpar office technology.

*Thump.*

The machine rattled. The bag of chips swayed. For a glorious second, gravity seemed to remember its job. The corner of the bag slipped a fraction of a millimeter.

"Yes," Artie hissed. "Come to papa."

But the bag held. It was as if the plastic had bonded with the metal coil on a molecular level. 

Artie’s frustration boiled over into a cold, focused rage. He put his Leather Wallet on the small ledge beneath the keypad and gripped the sides of the machine. He began to shake it. The Snack-Master 4000 was heavy, bolted to the floor in a way that suggested the manufacturers knew exactly how people like Artie would react to its failures.

"Give! Me! My! Chips!" 

He punctuated each word with a violent shove. Inside, the rows of candy bars and granola snacks danced, a rhythmic jiggling of high-fructose corn syrup. The Glitch-O's remained unmoved.

Artie stopped, panting. His slight build wasn't meant for this kind of physical exertion. He wiped sweat from his pale forehead and looked at the delivery flap at the bottom. It was a heavy metal door, designed to prevent "shrinkage"—the corporate term for people stealing snacks.

He knelt on the linoleum floor, the fluorescent lights overhead flickering in a way that gave him a mounting headache. He pushed the flap open. It resisted, the spring-loaded hinge snapping back against his fingers. 

"Ow! Son of a—"

He sucked on his bruised knuckle, the one with the old scar. This was personal now. The machine hadn't just stolen his money; it had drawn blood. 

He reached back in, shoving his arm up into the dark, narrow chute. His fingers brushed against something cold and metallic. He could feel the internal mechanism, the wires and the gears that governed the distribution of snacks. 

"I can feel you," he grunted, his shoulder pressed against the metal flap. "You're right there."

He stretched his arm further, his fingertips grazing the bottom of the chip bag. If he could just hook the plastic, he could pull it down. He ignored the "Do Not Reach Into Machine" warning sticker that was currently inches from his nose. That sticker was for people who had something to lose. Artie had nothing but a half-finished spreadsheet and a car that sounded like a blender.

His hand brushed against a loose wire. 

In that moment, the hum of the machine changed. It went from a low drone to a high-pitched whine. The flickering fluorescent light in the breakroom died, plunging the room into a dim, grey twilight. 

Artie felt a tingle in his fingertips. It wasn't the tingle of excitement. It was the tingle of several thousand volts of electricity deciding that his nervous system was a much more efficient path to the ground than the machine's actual wiring.

"Oh," Artie said. It was the only word he had time for.

The surge hit him like a physical blow. His muscles slammed shut, his hand clenching around the internal wiring of the Snack-Master 4000. He couldn't let go. He couldn't scream. He could only vibrate as the electricity cooked him from the inside out.

His vision didn't just go dark. It pixelated. 

The breakroom, the vending machine, the Corporate ID Badge hanging from his neck—it all started to dissolve into jagged blocks of color. The smell of ozone and burnt coffee filled his nostrils. He felt his heart skip a beat, then another, then simply stop trying altogether.

The Leather Wallet slipped from the ledge, hitting the floor with a dull thud. His Cracked Smartphone buzzed one last time in his pocket, a final, ignored request for a Q3 projection that would now remain forever unfinished.

Artie’s last thought wasn't about his family, or his unfulfilled dreams, or the crushing weight of corporate existence. 

It was about the chips. 

*I never even got to taste the Zesty Ranch,* he thought.

And then, the mundane world of spreadsheets and stuck snacks faded to a perfect, absolute black.
