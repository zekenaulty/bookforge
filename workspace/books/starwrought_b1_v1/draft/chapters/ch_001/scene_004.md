The first shadow-form didn't emerge from the darkness; it tore itself out of the violet-stained glass three paces to Kaelen's left. It rose with a sound like a wet whetstone against a blade—a long, agonizing screech of friction that vibrated through the soles of his boots. It had no face, only a vertical slit of deeper void that seemed to pull the surrounding light into a screaming vortex.

Kaelen’s hand went to the hilt of his longsword, but his fingers were already numb. The cold wasn't coming from the valley air, which was already a brittle, biting snap that made his lungs ache. It was radiating outward from the marrow of his right arm. There, the Starwrought Oath—a physical filament of pewter-colored celestial alloy—lay fractured within his radius bone. The star-shard, a heavy, jagged weight in his satchel, thrummed in a synchronized, sickening rhythm with the metal in his arm. 

Thump-hiss.

The shadow-form lunged. It didn't run; it glided, its base blurring into the jagged floor of the crater like ink dropped into water. 

Kaelen pivoted, his boots skidding on the razor-edged obsidian. He didn't draw his steel—not yet. Against the Void-touched, cold iron was little more than a suggestion. He reached inward, grasping for the tattered ends of the Oath. 

The reaction was instantaneous and brutal. As he channeled the intent to repel, the pewter filament in his forearm buckled. He felt the metal grind against the interior of his bone, a dry, splintering sensation that forced a gasp of scorched air from his lungs. The scent of ozone and old copper filled his nose, sharp enough to make his eyes water. It was the smell of magic being paid for in meat and calcium.

A burst of necrotic purple light flared from his palm, jagged and unstable. It struck the shadow-form mid-lunge. The creature didn't shatter; it dissolved into a cloud of oily soot that smelled of stagnant water and burnt hair. 

Kaelen fell to one knee, his right arm shaking. The skin above the radius bone was already turning a translucent, waxy white—the first sign of frost-burn. The price of the Starwrought magic was always physical, but with the Oath-filament fractured, the exchange rate had become ruinous. He could feel the cold leaching the strength from his bicep, turning his muscles into stiff, unresponsive cords.

"Not here," he hissed, the words puffing out in a cloud of silver vapor. "I won't die in a hole of my own making."

More shapes were rising. Three, then five, pulling themselves out of the impact fissures like oil seeping through cracks in a floor. They moved with a predatory grace that mocked the clumsy, glass-stiffened movements of a man. The star-shard in his satchel grew warmer, its rhythmic pulse accelerating until it was a frantic drumming against his hip. It wasn't just a relic; it was a beacon, and every Void-touched thing in the valley was answering the call.

He stood, forcing his legs to lock. He needed to reach the crater’s rim. The walls were a treacherous incline of flash-melted silica, sharp enough to flay a man to the bone if he slipped. 

The second shadow-form circled to his right, its form flickering like a dying candle. Kaelen drew his blade this time, more for the weight and the reach than the edge. He lashed out, the steel passing through the creature’s chest with no resistance. The shadow-form rippled, then elongated, a limb of pure darkness whipping toward his throat.

He threw up his right arm in a desperate block. The shadow struck the bracer, and the contact sent a jolt of absolute zero through his marrow. The pewter filament didn't just vibrate; it shrieked, the sound echoing in his skull like a bell struck with a hammer. 

A wave of white-hot frost erupted from the fracture point in his bone. It blasted outward in a radial arc, catching the shadow-form and two others behind it. They froze mid-motion, turned into brittle statues of dark ice before shattering into a thousand glittering shards that rained down on the glass floor.

Kaelen’s vision blurred. His lungs felt as though he’d swallowed a handful of needles. The metallic tang of magic was so thick now he could taste it on the back of his tongue—bitter, like a rusted coin. He looked down at his arm. The sleeve of his tunic was scorched away, and the skin was mapped with fine, dark veins that pulsed with a faint, dying violet light. The pewter filament was visible as a dark line beneath the waxy flesh, a foreign object that no longer fit the space it occupied.

The remaining shadows hesitated, their vertical maws twitching. They sensed the instability of the power he was wielding. It was a weapon that was killing its wielder as surely as it was destroying them.

Kaelen didn't wait for them to regroup. He turned and began the scramble up the crater wall. 

The glass was worse than he’d feared. It wasn't just sharp; it was brittle. Every handhold was a gamble. He jammed his gloved fingers into a crevice, feeling the leather slice open instantly. Blood, dark and steaming in the cold, slicked the obsidian. He ignored the sting, hauling himself upward, his boots scraping for purchase on the slick, violet-tinted surfaces. 

Below him, the shadow-forms began to climb. They didn't need handholds. They flowed up the vertical surfaces like ink spilled on a tilted page, their movements silent and relentless. 

He reached a narrow ledge halfway to the rim and spun around. His breath was coming in ragged, shallow gulps. The shard in his bag was vibrating so hard it was rattling his ribs, a frantic heartbeat that demanded release. 

"You want it?" Kaelen roared, his voice cracking. "Come and take the rest of me!"

He slammed his right palm against the glass ledge. He didn't try to shape the magic this time. He simply let the fractured Oath bleed, opening the floodgates of the filament's remaining power. 

The result was a catastrophic discharge. A pillar of violet fire erupted from the ledge, fueled by the marrow of his bone and the resonance of the star-shard. The shockwave threw Kaelen backward, his head slamming against the rock as the ledge disintegrated into a cloud of glass dust. 

The scream of the shadow-forms was a sound of collapsing stars. The violet light consumed them, scouring the crater wall clean of the void-taint for a fleeting, brilliant second.

Kaelen lay on a higher shelf of rock, his world reduced to a dull roar and the smell of his own scorched hair. His right arm was dead weight, a frozen limb of marble and agony. But the rhythmic thump-hiss of the shard had slowed. The immediate pursuit was gone, silenced by the sheer violence of the Oath’s failure.

He rolled onto his stomach, his fingers clawing at the dirt of the rim. He pulled himself over the edge, away from the glass and the violet glow. The Silver Valley lay behind him, a sea of shattered mirrors. Ahead, the dark silhouettes of the High Spire’s ruins beckoned, a skeletal reminder of the duty he had already failed.

He forced himself to his feet, cradling his ruined arm. He was alive, but the pewter filament in his bone felt thin—as if the next time he called upon it, it might simply dissolve into dust, leaving him as hollow as the ruins he guarded.
