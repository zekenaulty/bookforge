Goal
- Lock Story 5.R decisions for prompt budgeter and continuity pack.

Context
- User confirmed continuity pack should be defined now and generated by the LLM.
- User confirmed budgets are reporting-only; no truncation even if over budget.

Commands
- None.

Files
- resources/plans/bookforge_plan_v2.md
- resources/plans/steps_20260118_0041_story5r_budgeter_continuity.md

Tests
- Not run (planning change only).

Issues
- None.

Decision
- Continuity pack is a first-class artifact generated by the LLM.
- Budgets are tracked and logged; no truncation on over-budget payloads.
- Token estimation remains deterministic and provider-agnostic.

Completion
- Story 5.R accepted and locked.

Next Actions
- Proceed to Story 6.R refinement (author library versioning and generation UX).
