## One-to-One Change Detail
- Change type: no semantic text change; composition-managed layout only.
- Source-to-compiled expectation: equivalent text for this pass.

## Stability Controls
- Runtime path unchanged (still loads flat template files from `resources/prompt_templates/*` after distribution).
- Schema-sensitive examples preserved verbatim in this pass.
- Any normalization of known malformed wrapped lines is explicitly deferred.
