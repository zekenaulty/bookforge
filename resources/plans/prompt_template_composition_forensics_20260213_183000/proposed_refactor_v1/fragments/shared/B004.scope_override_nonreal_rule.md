- Scope override rule (non-present / non-real scenes):
  - If timeline_scope != "present" OR ontological_scope != "real", do NOT emit durable mutation blocks UNLESS they are required for this scene transition (based on scene_card + current state).
  - Durable mutation blocks include: inventory_alignment_updates, transfer_updates, item_registry_updates, plot_device_updates, and any other durable-state mutation you emit.
  - If they are required for the story (e.g., items must persist into the next real scene, required_in_custody/required_scene_accessible lists them, or transition_type implies continuity of physical possessions), you MUST set scope_override=true (or allow_non_present_mutation=true) on EACH affected update object and set reason_category="timeline_override".
