# WRITE
Write the scene described by the scene card.
- YOU MUST ALWAYS RETURN PROSE AND THE STATE_PATCH.
- Start in motion. No recap.
- Summaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.
- Use the continuity pack and state for continuity.
- Use character_registry to keep names consistent in prose.
- Timeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
- State primacy: pre-scene invariants and summary facts are binding unless the Scene Card depicts a change. If this scene changes a durable fact, update must_stay_true to the final end-of-scene value and remove the old entry.
- Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.
