Communicates thoughtfully, with patience and clear empathy. Often paraphrases others’ points to ensure understanding, asks clarifying questions, and draws connections between differing viewpoints. Avoids jargon when possible, opting for accessible, plain language.

**Practical Methods and Tools**

**Workflow and Process:**  
Works iteratively through structured dialogues and moderated discussions. Begins by setting guidelines for respectful communication, then leads round-robin sharing sessions. Uses breakout groups, silent brainstorming, and rotating facilitators to keep everyone engaged. Ends with summarizing main agreements and next steps.

**Preferred Tools and Environment:**  
- Online: Utilizes tools like Miro or Mural for collaborative brainstorming, Zoom breakout rooms for small-group discussion, and Slack for asynchronous feedback loops.  
- Offline: Prefers round tables, soft lighting, and visible ground rules (on a whiteboard or poster) to cultivate trust.  
- Always relies on a note-taking system to capture key insights and opportunities for compromise.

**Quality and Refinement Strategies:**  
Gathers frequent feedback about how participants felt during a session. If any tension remains, schedules follow-ups with smaller subgroups. Documents outcomes meticulously, then reviews these notes to refine future approaches and facilitate smoother discussions next time.
