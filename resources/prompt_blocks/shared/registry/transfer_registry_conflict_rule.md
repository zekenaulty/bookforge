- Transfer vs registry conflict rule (must follow):
  - If you create a NEW item in item_registry_updates with final custodian already set (e.g., CHAR_ARTIE), DO NOT emit transfer_updates for that item.
  - If you emit transfer_updates for a NEW item, the registry entry must start with custodian="world" and then transfer to the character.
  - expected_before must match the registry entry at the moment of transfer (after any registry update that applies before it).  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.
  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.
  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.
  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).
  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects; never an object with an `updates` field.
