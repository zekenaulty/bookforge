# REPAIR

Fix the scene based on lint issues.
Summaries are reference-only; do not recap them in prose unless scene_card explicitly requires recap.
Timeline Lock: only depict events explicitly listed in the current Scene Card. Do not depict, imply, or resolve later-scene milestones (acquisition, binding, reveals, travel arrival, injury changes) unless the Scene Card explicitly contains that milestone.
State primacy: state invariants and summary facts are binding; do not contradict them.
Milestone uniqueness: if a milestone is marked DONE in must_stay_true, do not depict it again. If marked NOT_YET, do not depict it now.
Spatial/inventory consistency: injuries, inventory, and ownership must remain consistent unless explicitly changed in the Scene Card.
Inventory contract: track ownership and container location for key items; update must_stay_true when items move or change hands.
For held items, specify container=hand_left or container=hand_right.
Continuity system ownership is mandatory, and must be tracked: any mechanic/UI numbers, skills, titles, classes, ranks, resources, cooldowns, effects, statuses, or future mechanic families must be sourced from existing continuity system state or written into continuity system updates.
Durable vs ephemeral mechanics:
- If a DURABLE mechanic appears multiple times in the scene (e.g., base values then final values), the LAST occurrence is canonical.
- You MUST capture the canonical end-of-scene values in character_continuity_system_updates.
- When allocation/level-up happens, update all affected point pools (e.g., stat_points, skill_points, perk_points) if shown.
- Do not treat early UI snapshots as canonical if the scene later corrects them.
- DURABLE mechanics = persistent stats/caps, skills/titles, lasting status effects, inventory/custody, permanent buffs/debuffs.
- EPHEMERAL UI/telemetry = roll results, damage numbers, overkill/comedic calculators, one-off warnings, momentary combat logs.
- UI/system readouts must be on their own line, starting with '[' and ending with ']'.
- Do NOT embed bracketed UI in narrative sentences.
- Allowed suffix after a UI block is punctuation or '(locked)' only.

- DURABLE mechanics must be owned by continuity system state (or added via STATE_PATCH in the same output).
- EPHEMERAL readouts do NOT require state ownership unless the scene explicitly intends them to persist beyond this scene.
Canonical descriptors (colors, item names, effect IDs, mechanic labels) must be reused exactly; do not paraphrase.
If item_registry or plot_devices are provided, they are canonical durable-state references for authoritative labels and custody terms.
Use item_registry.items[].display_name in prose; use item_id only in patches/JSON. The display_name must be human readable and not an escaped id/name.
summary_update arrays are mandatory; do not omit or leave empty unless explicitly stated.
STATE_PATCH must record all major events and outcomes from the prose; if an event happens, add it to key_events and update must_stay_true as needed.
must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger entry for every milestone referenced in the Scene Card or already present in state.
If state lacks a key invariant needed for this scene, seed it in must_stay_true using standard phrasing.
Enforce scene-card durable constraints: `required_in_custody`, `required_scene_accessible`, `forbidden_visible`, `device_presence`; treat `required_visible_on_page` as explicit narrative requirement when present.
Respect `timeline_scope` and `ontological_scope`; avoid physical durable custody changes in non-present/non-real scope unless explicit override is present.
Return corrected prose plus a corrected state_patch JSON block.

Output format (required, no code fences, no commentary):
COMPLIANCE:
Scene ID: <scene_card.scene_id>
Allowed events: <short list from Scene Card>
Forbidden milestones: <from must_stay_true>
Current arm-side / inventory facts: <from must_stay_true>

PROSE:
<scene prose>

STATE_PATCH:
<json>

STATE_PATCH rules:
- Use schema_version "1.0".
- Use world_updates to update world state (cast_present, location, recent_facts, open_threads).
- Use scene_card.cast_present_ids for cast_present (ids, not names).
- Use scene_card.thread_ids for open_threads (thread ids).
- Do not invent new character or thread ids.
- Include summary_update arrays: last_scene (array of 2-4 sentence strings), key_events (array of 3-7 bullet strings), must_stay_true (array of 3-7 bullet strings), chapter_so_far_add (array of bullet strings).
- Include story_so_far_add only at chapter end (or when scene_card explicitly requests).
- Use threads_touched only if you can reference thread ids from scene_card.thread_ids.
- Include character_continuity_system_updates for cast_present_ids when mechanics change.
  - Use set/delta/remove/reason.
  - Use nested families under set/delta (examples): stats, skills, titles, resources, effects, statuses, classes, ranks.
  - titles must be arrays of objects with stable name fields (example: [{"name": "Novice", "source": "starting_class", "active": true}]).
  - If a new mechanic family appears, add it under set with a stable key.
- Include global_continuity_system_updates only if global mechanics change.
- All *_updates arrays must contain objects; never emit bare strings as array entries.
- character_updates.containers must be an array of objects with at least: container, owner, contents (array).
- Durable-state mutation blocks are mandatory when applicable:
- Required fields for durable registry entries (when creating NEW ids or filling missing required fields):
  - item_registry_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry requires item_id and can include set/delta/remove/reason.
    - INVALID: item_registry_updates = {"set": {"ITEM_X": {...}}}
    - VALID: item_registry_updates = [{"item_id": "ITEM_X", "set": {...}}]
  - plot_device_updates MUST be an array of objects. Each entry requires device_id and can include set/delta/remove/reason.
    - INVALID: plot_device_updates = {"set": {"DEVICE_X": {...}}}
    - VALID: plot_device_updates = [{"device_id": "DEVICE_X", "set": {...}}]

  - item_registry_updates: set must include name, type, owner_scope, custodian, linked_threads, state_tags, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_device_id, replacement_of.
  - plot_device_updates: set must include name, custody_scope, custody_ref, activation_state, linked_threads, constraints, last_seen {chapter, scene, location}. Optional: display_name, aliases, linked_item_id.
  - If you introduce a new item_id/device_id anywhere in this patch, you MUST include a corresponding registry update with the full required fields.
  - `inventory_alignment_updates` for scene-fit posture normalization.
  - `item_registry_updates` for durable item metadata/custody changes.
  - `plot_device_updates` for durable plot-device custody/activation changes.
  - `transfer_updates` for item handoffs (source, destination, reason, optional transfer_chain).
  - Every `transfer_updates` entry must include `item_id` and `reason` (non-empty string).
  - `inventory_alignment_updates` must be an array of objects; never an object with an `updates` field.
- For off-screen normalization and non-trivial durable mutations, include `reason_category` with stable values like `time_skip_normalize`, `location_jump_normalize`, `after_combat_cleanup`, `stowed_at_inn`, `handoff_transfer`, `knowledge_reveal`.
- If you mutate durable state, do not leave the same mutation only in prose.
- Include character_updates entries for cast_present_ids that change state (inventory, containers, persona shifts).
  - Each entry must include character_id, chapter, scene, inventory (full current list), containers (full current list), invariants_add (array), persona_updates (array).
  - character_updates.inventory MUST be an array of objects, never string item ids.
  - Inventory object shape: {"item": "ITEM_or_name", "container": "hand_left|hand_right|<container>", "status": "held|carried|equipped|stowed"}.
  - Container object shape: {"container": "<name>", "owner": "CHAR_id", "contents": ["ITEM_id", "..."]}.
  - If you have a single persona update, still wrap it in an array of strings.
- must_stay_true must include a milestone ledger and invariants using standard phrasing, e.g.:
  - Avoid numeric mechanics in must_stay_true; store them in continuity system updates instead.
  - inventory: CHAR_example -> shard (carried, container=satchel)
  - inventory: CHAR_example -> longsword (carried, container=hand_right)
  - container: satchel (owner=CHAR_example, contents=[shard, maps])
  - milestone: shard_bind = DONE/NOT_YET
  - milestone: maps_acquired = DONE/NOT_YET
  - injury: right forearm scar / left arm filament
  - ownership: shard (carried) / shard (bound but physical)
